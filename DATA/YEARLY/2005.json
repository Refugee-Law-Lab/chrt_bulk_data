INTRODUCTION\nA. The position of the Commission\nB. The Respondent's position\nII. ANALYSIS\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Aleta Gaucher filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in 1998 alleging discrimination under section 7 of the Act. The Commission now brings a Motion to amend the Complaint. The Complainant supports the amendment.\n[2] The material filed by the Commission is not entirely clear. As I understand it, the application is simply to add a reference to section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in the Allegation clause of the complaint, which would then read as follows:\nThe Canadian Armed Forces have discriminated against me on the grounds of sex, race, national or ethnic origin, marital status, family status and age by treating me in an adverse differential manner, by failing to promote me, and by refusing to continue to employ me in violation of Section 7 [and section 10] of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nIn the future, I would ask that the Commission file a Notice of Motion with an attachment containing the exact wording of the proposed amendment. This would be in keeping with section 3(1) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\nA. The position of the Commission [3] The Commission submits that the complaint is based on allegations that the employment policies of the Canadian Forces systemically discriminate against women, aboriginal women and single mothers. In paragraph 26 of it's written submissions, the Commission states that this was brought to the attention of the Respondent in a variety of ways, in both the proceedings before the Commission and an application for judicial review in the Federal Court.\n26. In this case, the Respondent had notice of the systemic nature of the complaint in the pre-complaint stage by way of the affidavit of the complainant in her judicial review application as well as throughout the course of the investigation and supplementary investigation by the Commission.\nThe written submissions refer to a number of passages in the existing documentation that contain references to the systemic nature of the Complaint.\n[4] The Respondent objects that most of these passages are taken from the affidavit that was provided to the Federal Court. In spite of this, it is evident that the investigation was reopened, at a relatively late stage, to collect information regarding five male employees who were allegedly promoted ahead of the Complainant. This would seem to be the point of departure for any inquiry into the systemic aspects of the complaint. The Respondent was apparently of the view that it could not provide this information under the Privacy Act without a subpoena or a warrant.\n[5] I think the more important factor lies in the evidentiary process. I say this because the Commission suggests that it is difficult if not impossible to investigate Ms. Gaucher's complaint without examining a number of systemic issues in the workplace. This is an inevitable part of the law of human rights and is frequently the case in those matters that come before the Tribunal. The Federal Court has held that the Commission is entitled to lead institutional and systemic evidence as circumstantial evidence, which may help to establish that an individual complainant was discriminated against.\nB. The position of the Respondent [6] The Respondent has opposed the application. It submits that the amendment would significantly change the nature of the complaint and prolong the ultimate resolution of it. The essential submission is that the statutory scheme must be respected. The Tribunal cannot inquire into a complaint unless it has gone through the process set out in the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[7] The Respondent cites the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in IMP Group Limited v. Dillman [1995] N.S.J. No. 326 (QL), at para. 37, where the court says:\nAs counsel for the Company says, it was not merely an extension, elaboration or clarification of the sexual harassment complaint already before the Board. To raise a new complaint at the hearing stage would circumvent the whole legislative process that is designed to provide for attempts at conciliation and settlement. This matter did not go through the preliminary stages of investigation, conciliation and referral by the Commission to an inquiry pursuant to s. 32A of the Act. The Board dealt with a matter which had never been referred to it.\nThe Respondent also cites my own decision in Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation [2002] CHRT 2002\/04\/22, where I wrote that there is a point where an amendment introduces a substantially new complaint.\n[8] I naturally agree with these statements of the law. The substance of the complaint must pass through the referral process. The Commission cannot bring in a new complaint after the referral, under the guise of an amendment, and circumvent its own referral process. The situation was quite different in Dillman, however, where the amendment related to an averment of facts that were not included in the original complaint. There are cases on the other side, which seem much closer to the situation before me. In Woiden v. Lynn CHRT 2002\/01\/23, for example, the member allowed an amendment of the complaint to include a reference to an additional section in the Act, on the basis that the facts before the Tribunal would remain the same.\nII. ANALYSIS [9] The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Canadian Human Rights Act comes from the fact that the complaint has been referred by the Commission. This provides the general context in which any request for an amendment must be considered. The Commission must have considered the essential situation that forms the subject-matter of the inquiry, when it referred the complaint to the Tribunal. This places certain limits on amendments, which must have their pedigree in the circumstances that were put before the Commission.\n[10] This is only one aspect of the matter however. I think that one needs to be conscious of the reality of the situation, in examining an application for an amendment. The complaint form is there primarily for the purposes of the Commission. It is a necessary first step, which raises a set of facts that call for further investigation. The complaint form provides an important starting point and is inherently approximate. It was never intended to serve the purposes of a pleading in adjudicative process leading up to a hearing. It is the Statements of Particulars, rather than the original complaint, that set the more precise terms of the hearing.\n[11] The parties must be aware that there is nothing unusual in the request for an amendment. The forms that come before the Tribunal are usually drawn up before the Complaint has been properly examined and all the relevant facts are on the table. It is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will often come to light in the course of the investigation. It follows that complaints are open to refinement. As long as the substance of the original complaint is respected, I do not see why the Complainant and the Commission should not be allowed to clarify and elaborate upon the initial allegations before the matter goes to a hearing.\n[12] I think that human rights tribunals have adopted a liberal approach to amendments. This is in keeping with the Canadian Human Rights Act, which is remedial legislation. It should not be interpreted in a narrow or technical manner. In Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.J. No. 75 (QL), at para. 50, for example, the Supreme Court approved of an amendment to a complaint that simply brought the complaint into conformity with the proceedings. I think that I am presented with a similar situation. It is merely a matter of ensuring that the form of the complaint accurately reflects the substance of the allegations that were referred to the Tribunal.\n[13] The Federal Court has also endorsed this approach. In Canadian Human Rights Commission et al. v. Bell Canada 2002 FCT 776, at para. 31, Justice Kelen suggests that the rule before the Tribunal and the Federal Court should be the same. The jurisprudence in human rights:\n. . . is echoed in the decisions of the Federal Court with respect to amendments to pleadings under Rule 75 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998. I refer to the case of Rolls Royce plc v. Fitzwilliam (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (F.C.T.D.), where Blanchard J. set out as a general rule that proposed amendments should be allowed where they do not result in prejudice to the opposing party . . .\nJustice Kelen then quotes the Federal Court of Appeal, in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, [1994] 1 F.C. 3 (F.C.A.) at p. 10, to much the same effect. As long as they can be tracked back to the facts and allegations that went before the Commission, and do not prejudice the Respondent, amendments should be allowed. This assists all of the parties in determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.\n[14] As I see it, the Commission simply wants to clarify the legalities of the situation, in advance of the hearing, so that all of the parties are on notice that the Complaint raises deeper systemic issues. This is a laudable move. It is better to be explicit. I do not accept the Respondent's characterization of the request for an amendment as a request to add a new, systemic complaint to the inquiry. The chose or tort or delict before the Tribunal will remain as it was before any amendment was granted. The substance of the complaint will remain as it was before any amendment was granted.\n[15] I should add that I think the Commission could proceed without an amendment. The provisions in section 53 that deal with relief do not distinguish between the private and systemic aspects of a complaint and it is a mistake to draw some rigid dichotomy between complaints under section 7 and section 10. The Act is remedial and calls for a more organic approach. As a general rule, the Tribunal has an obligation to follow the substance of the complaint, wherever it leads. The issue on remedy is simply whether the corrective action that the Commission is seeking arises naturally out of the allegations before the Tribunal. This is generally determined by the facts of the case rather than the section under which the complaint was laid.\n[16] The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Robinson, [1994] 3 F.C. (F.C.A) 228, at 248, would at least implicitly support the contention that the scope of the remedial power exercised by the Tribunal is determined by the provisions of section 53, as I have suggested, rather than the section under which the complaint is laid. It would follow that systemic remedies are available, if the complaint, the ensuing investigation and disclosure process before the Tribunal indicate that they are appropriate. If the source of the alleged discrimination under section 7 lies in the system of promotions, I would think that the Tribunal has an obligation to inquire into that process.\n[17] The statements of particulars in the immediate case have not been exchanged. It follows that any issue with regard to the evidence that the Commission wishes to introduce or the precise remedy that it is seeking will have to be left for another day. From a practical perspective, however, one has to wonder how it is possible to inquire into the process of promotions as it affects the Complainant without looking into the process of promotions more generally? If the evidence establishes that there are deficiencies in that process, it seems to me that the Commission is within its rights to have the process corrected under section 53 of the Act. That is clearly what the Act contemplates.\n[18] The real issue in a case like the one before me is whether the amendment would prejudice the Respondent. This calls for an exercise of judgement, rather than a logical or linguistic analysis of the original complaint. The question is whether the proposed amendment would seriously undermine the fairness of the process. The basic principle is simple enough. If a proposed amendment opens up a new and unanticipated route of inquiry, it should not be allowed. The practical issue is usually whether the Respondent has had sufficient notice to meet the requirements of natural justice.\n[19] I see nothing in the amendment requested by the Commission that is prejudicial in this sense. The amendment is accordingly allowed, in the terms that I have set out.\nSigned by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 13, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T903\/2304\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Aleta Gaucher v.

Hadjis\n2005 CHRT 10 2005\/02\/17\n[1] This ruling relates to a request by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) to have the Tribunal conduct one hearing to inquire into the Complainant's two human rights complaints against the same respondent. Her first complaint, which I will refer to as the Disability Complaint (Commission File Number 20020557), was filed on July 31, 2002. Her second complaint, which I will refer to as the Retaliation Complaint (Commission File Number 20031212), was filed on January 20, 2004.\n[2] The Complainant alleges in her Disability Complaint that her employer, the Respondent, discriminated against her on the ground of her disability in contravention of s. 7 of the Act. She claims that the Respondent refused to accommodate her when she returned to work after having undergone surgery and other treatments for colon cancer.\n[3] In the Retaliation Complaint, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent retaliated against her because she filed the Disability Complaint. She sets out a list of 30 incidents that she claims constitute retaliation. She submits that this conduct diminished her authority at work, hindered her ability to effectively carry out her duties, and negatively affected her credibility with staff and managers under her supervision. The final listed incident of retaliation is the dismissal from her job, which occurred on September 2, 2003.\n[4] The Commission referred the Disability Complaint to the Tribunal on August 19, 2004. The Retaliation Complaint was referred on December 20, 2004, and was accompanied by a letter from the Chief Commissioner requesting that the Retaliation Complaint be consolidated with the Disability Complaint, as the Commission was satisfied that the two complaints involve substantially the same issues of fact and law. On January 20, 2005, the Respondent notified the parties and the Tribunal that it objected to the consolidation of the two complaints, disagreeing with the Commission's position that similar issues are involved in both cases.\n[5] There is no specific provision in the Act regarding the power of the Tribunal to join complaints where the parties to each complaint are the same. Section 40 (4) provides that the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute a single inquiry in situations where two or more complainants have each filed separate complaints against the same respondent. This is not the case here. However, as was noted by the Tribunal in Lattey v. C.P.R. and M. Douglas (February 25, 2002), T685\/7301 and T686\/7401 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 12, the issue of whether to hold a single hearing or multiple hearings into complaints is, in the absence of any specific statutory direction, a procedural matter that the Tribunal has the authority to address as master of its own procedure.\n[6] The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should refuse to hear both complaints in one hearing, since the issues being dealt with in each are substantially different. It is argued that while the Disability Complaint relates to an alleged failure to accommodate, the Retaliation Complaint concerns the termination of the Complainant's employment. The Respondent notes that the Complainant has filed an unjust dismissal complaint pursuant to the Canada Labour Code, which will be heard before an adjudicator within the next few months.\n[7] I do not agree with the Respondent's submission. The Retaliation Complaint deals with significantly more events than just the termination of her employment. The Complainant specifically alleges that all of the incidents detailed in the complaint, including her dismissal, constitute retaliation against her for having filed the Disability Complaint. The issue raised is not so much whether her dismissal was unjust but rather whether retaliation against the filing of the Disability Complaint constituted at least one of the factors in the alleged conduct against her, in violation of s. 14.1 of the Act. This is precisely the form of discrimination contemplated by this provision.\n[8] The Tribunal has had occasion in the past to rule on whether to allow the amendment of an existing complaint of discrimination in order to add a claim of retaliation under s. 14.1 (see e.g. Kavanagh v. Correctional Services of Canada (May 31, 1999), T505\/2298 (C.H.R.T.); Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2; Blondin v. Purolator Courier Ltd., 2005 CHRT 7). It has been observed in these cases that it makes sense for evidence of acts made in reprisal to an existing human rights complaint, to be heard within the context of the hearing into that complaint. Before granting such amendments, however, the Tribunal should be satisfied that the respondent is not prejudiced by a lack of sufficient notice of the new allegations. The respondent must be given the chance to properly defend itself.\n[9] These notions can certainly be extended to the present situation. The allegations set out in the Retaliation Complaint are hardly new to the Respondent - the complaint was filed over a year ago. It has not been demonstrated to me how the joinder at this stage of two separate yet connected pre-existing complaints could potentially prejudice the Respondent in the presentation of its case. If anything, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings would appear to be in the common interest of all parties, including the Respondent.\n[10] The Respondent has raised an additional submission, which relates to the Commission's authority, pursuant to s. 41 (1) b) of the Act, to refuse to deal with a complaint that could be more appropriately dealt with by another legal procedure. The Respondent takes issue with the Commission's decision to not exercise this authority and refuse to deal with the Retaliation Complaint, in light of the Complainant's pending Canada Labour Code complaint. The Respondent is in effect seeking a review of the Commission's conduct with regard to the Retaliation Complaint. However, this is a matter that falls within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court, not the Tribunal (see Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd., (August 2, 2000), T565\/2300 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 4). I cannot therefore address this submission.\n[11] For the above reasons, the Commission's request to consolidate the Disability Complaint and the Retaliation Complaint is granted. The Tribunal will conduct one hearing to inquire into the two complaints.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

The Respondent admitted liability and the case proceeded on the basis of an agreement on the facts. The only outstanding issue is the amount of compensation to which the Complainant is entitled for lost wages.\n[2] The Tribunal has encountered a variety of obstacles in trying to bring the case to its proper conclusion. By my count, and I am sure there are others, the Complainant is responsible for at least five delays in the process. Some of this may be attributable to her psychological state. The equities in the case nevertheless lie on the side of the Respondent and the Commission.\n[3] The Complainant takes the position that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is unable to work. She attributes this to the discrimination, which occurred between 1984 and 1996. The Respondent and the Commission have submitted that there is no evidence that the effects of the discrimination have prevented her from finding employment. They say that an award of 22,000 dollars for two years of lost wages would be sufficient.\n[4] Counsel for the Complainant, Mr. Korchin, has now provided the Tribunal with a medical report and an affidavit from Ms. McAuley. The parties have asked me to deal with the relevance and admissibility of this material on the basis of written submissions. Although I have received submissions from all counsel, Mr. Korchin now seems to have changed his mind on the matter. All I can say is that it is too late for this. I have already cancelled the remaining hearing days, at the request of the parties.\n[5] Although the affidavit from Ms. McAuley establishes her firm belief that the discrimination has had a lasting psychological effect, it does not contribute all that much to the positions taken by the parties. I cannot see any reason why the bare affidavit would not be admissible, subject to any rights of cross-examination. It has been suggested that Ms. McAuley should be spared the rigours of viva voce evidence.\n[6] The exhibits attached to the affidavit are more problematic. They include material from the files of Dr. Burgess, a psychiatrist, which contains the strongest statement in the Complainant's favour. In one document, Dr. Burgess states that the workplace environment was definitely a cause, the sole cause of triggering the post traumatic stress disorder. This conclusion is naturally based on information that he received from Ms. McAuley.\n[7] The exact words that Dr. Burgess uses may be significant. I say this because he refers to the triggering of the disorder rather than the disorder itself. This is in keeping with the position of the Respondent, which has suggested that other factors contributed to the origins of the disorder. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the material from Dr. Burgess is taken from correspondence regarding a complaint that Ms. McAuley filed with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n[8] The medical report consists of a brief letter from Dr. Li, a psychiatrist, who apparently saw the Complainant four years after she left Dr. Burgess. It contains only the most general evaluation of the situation and is of little assistance without the material supplied by Dr. Burgess. The medical information, taken as a whole, might be sufficient to establish that the precipitating cause of any post-traumatic stress disorder lies in the discrimination. It does not comment on the longevity of such a cause.\n[9] Mr. Garden, for the Respondent, argues that the medical evidence is inadmissible. His submission is based primarily on the fact that the Respondent has not had an opportunity to investigate the Complainant's psychological condition and obtain its own advice on the matter. It would simply be unfair to let the Complainant lead this evidence without giving the Respondent an opportunity to reply.\n[10] This kind of argument is based on the principles of natural justice. There are other terms, like fundamental justice or even due process, that may be helpful. At the end of the day, however, the question is simply whether the process is fair. This calls for an exercise of judgement, which takes into account the various factors that arise in the case. I agree with counsel that any questions of fairness must be decided in the specific context of each case.\n[11] I do not think it would be fair to let the Complainant introduce this kind of psychiatric evidence without giving the Respondent an ample opportunity to respond. The Respondent submits that this would require some kind of independent psychological examination. Ms. McAuley has wavered on this question. At one point, she was unwilling to submit to such an examination. At another point, her lawyer was unable to obtain instructions. At yet another point, she appeared to say yes, but with conditions that would at least symbolically leave her in control of the process. I cannot accept these conditions.\n[12] The best that can be said is that the Complainant is extremely reluctant to submit herself to any kind of independent medical or psychological examination. I do not take issue with her feelings on this account. Psychological records provide the most personal accounts of our individual lives. In a society that values privacy and personal autonomy, public policy militates against any order that would compel an individual to share such records with a stranger. There is no doubt in my mind that any psychologist or psychiatrist retained by the Respondent would be a stranger within the meaning of these words.\n[13] There are significant differences between a psychological and a medical examination. I am quite sure that a psychologist or psychiatrist would be uncomfortable with the idea that a patient can be compelled, as a matter of force, to submit to the kind of probing encounter that is necessary to establish the origins of a psychological disorder. For a fuller discussion of these issues, I would refer the parties to my ruling in Day v. Department of National Defense, No. 4 (2002\/12\/18).\n[14] There is some recognition of these issues in Bion v. Sehok, QB 1998 SASK. D. 770.45.20.00-01 (QL), which was cited by counsel for the Complainant. I do not accept, however, that it would be reasonable to allow the Complainant or some independent body to nominate the examining psychiatrist or psychologist. I realize that the Complainant does not trust the legal or medical process. This is regrettable but does not alter the situation. It would not be fair to the Respondent to deprive it of the right to choose its own expert, unless compelling grounds have been advanced for doing so. In any event, the issues that arise in the present case go far beyond the identity of the Respondent's proposed expert.\n[15] There is no need to discuss the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to order a psychological examination. All three counsel seem to agree that it would not be in Ms. McAuley's psychological interests to submit to such an examination. I think their views deserve a certain measure of respect. There is an element of professional and even moral judgement that comes into play in dealing with these kinds of issues, which takes lawyers beyond the narrow self-interests of the parties. In the circumstances, I do not think it is in the interest of the Complainant, or the larger public interest, to require her to submit to the potential indignity of an independent psychological examination.\n[16] On the medical issue, this is where the matter rests. I have the psychiatric information tendered by the Complainant. The problem is that this information is all on one side. As I have stated, it would be a plain contravention of the most basic principles of justice to let the Complainant introduce such evidence, without giving the Respondent an equal opportunity to do so. I am accordingly of the view that the medical documents are inadmissible.\n[17] The second argument is advanced by Ms. Reaume, for the Commission. She simply submits that the medical information provided by the Complainant is not material to the issue that comes before me. It does not assist me in determining the amount of compensation to which the Complainant is entitled for lost wages. The Respondent and the Commission have already acknowledged that the discrimination was a proximate cause of the Complainant's condition.\n[18] I agree with the Commission. Even if the documents were entered into evidence, they are too general to be of much assistance. They do not address the financial question before me. I think the psychological information is too sparse and too imprecise to assist me in determining the extent to which the Respondent should be held responsible for her ongoing problems.\n[19] At the end of the day, I am left with the original agreement on the facts. This is sufficient to establish that the Respondent is liable for 22,000 dollars in lost wages, with interest. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that would justify a larger sum. I cannot see any reason to ask for further submissions. I will nevertheless reserve jurisdiction in the case for 30 days, to allow the parties to raise any other issues that might require the assistance of the Tribunal. Once the thirty days have elapsed, I will instruct the Registrar to issue a Notice of Discontinuance and close the file.\n[20] I would like to make one final comment. The human rights process is remedial. I accordingly think it is important to recognize the positive steps taken by employers in rectifying such matters. The Respondent in the present case deserves considerable credit for accepting its responsibilities and adopting a constructive approach to the resolution of the complaint. I appreciate the work of all counsel on the file.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 23, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT723\/2802\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDebby McAuley v.

It referred us to three authorities: R. v. Mohan, (1994) 80 C.C.C. (3d) 401, a criminal case, Mayfield v. Mayfield, [2001] O.J. No.2212, a civil matter and the Tribunal's decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Minister of Personnel for the Government of the Northwest Territories, decided on August 27, 2001.\n[3] The Mohan decision in particular deals with factors to be applied in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. According to the decision, admission of expert evidence depends on the application of the following criteria:\nrelevance; necessity in assisting the trier of fact; the absence of any exclusionary rule; a properly qualified expert.\n[4] In applying the Mohan criteria in a Tribunal setting, we must always remember that we are not dealing with the admission of expert evidence in a trial by jury setting and that the issue of the qualification of the expert cannot be considered in a voir dire, where the judge involved has the opportunity to assess the evidence to be given and apply to it the Mohan criteria.\n[5] As stated by my colleague, Paul Groarke, in the PSAC decision:\nThe purpose of expert evidence is to assist an adjudicative body in deciding the facts of the case. It does so by providing the trier of facts with knowledge and ready-made inferences which stand outside the scope of their experience. It follows that experts have a special role in litigation which relies on statistical and scientific evidence. The issue in each instance is whether the evidence is necessary to decide the issues in the case. It is important to distinguish between the issues which arise on an application for leave to call witnesses and the issues which arise with respect to the admissibility of their testimony. Although it is inevitable that there will be some blurring of the line between the two areas, issues with respect to the relevance and admissibility of an expert's testimony are more properly decided when the witness is called.\n[6] Counsel for the Respondent appeared to take the position that the relevant question was whether the proposed evidence was necessary in assisting the Tribunal to decide the issue. It is important to remember that a Tribunal is not in a position, at the qualification stage, where it can fully assess the reliability of the proposed witness' evidence. The most that can be expected at this stage is for the Tribunal to address the issue whether this testimony would logically contribute to the case of the party calling the witness. Paraphrasing my colleague Paul Groarke: It is accordingly sufficient if it can be reasonably said that the expert's testimony is needed to determine one of the factual issues in the case.\n[7] In order to do this and in all fairness to the opposing party it is important that the Tribunal and the opposing party have access to the substance of the expert's proposed testimony. That is why the Tribunal in its Interim Rules of Procedure provides at rule 6(4):\n6(4) Where a party has given Notice of its intention to call an expert witness under 6(1)(f), it shall, in addition to the summary required under 6(1)(f), serve and file a report not less than ten days before the commencement of the hearing which report shall,\nbe signed by the expert, set out the expert's name, address and qualification; and set out the substance of the expert's proposed testimony.\n[8] In this case, counsel for the complainant did not provide a Notice of its intention to call an expert witness, nor did he file a report of the substance of the expert's proposed testimony. This being the case, the Tribunal will not qualify this witness as an expert witness.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 23, 2005\n[9] CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\n[10] PARTIES OF RECORD\n[11] TRIBUNAL FILE NO.: T928\/4804\n[12] STYLE OF CAUSE: Mary Mellon v.

Introduction.\nII. Facts.\nIII. Law and Analysis.\nI. Introduction [1] Fred Smith has filed a complaint against S & S. Delivery Service, his former employer. S & S is owned by Brian Slobodian. Mr. Smith worked for Mr. Slobodian from March 2001 to April of 2002. He worked five days a week, sometimes on Saturday. He was paid by mileage.\n[2] The complaint states that S & S Delivery:\n. . . has discriminated against me in violation of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by requiring me to submit to a drug test prior to allowing me to return to work following an injury and by failing to return me to work because of a perceived disability (drug dependency).\nIt will become apparent that the situation is not so simple.\n[3] The hearing in the case took less than a day. Mr. Smith and Mr. Slobodian were the only witnesses. They had no lawyers. Their submissions crossed into testimony and it was difficult to keep the inquiry within its proper legal bounds.\nII. Facts [4] Mr. Smith and Mr. Slobodian never liked each other. On April 23rd, 2002, the truck that Mr. Smith was driving hit a pothole. It must have been a terrible pothole. Mr. Smith\u2019s head hit the roof of the cab and his neck was badly injured. He was off work for six weeks and filed a claim with the Worker\u2019s Compensation Board. They provided him with six thousand dollars.\n[5] Mr. Slobodian is convinced that Mr. Smith wasn\u2019t wearing a seat belt when his head hit the roof. He admitted that he doesn\u2019t wear a belt when he drives at home. Mr. Smith nevertheless insists that he was wearing a belt at the time of the accident. He adds that the real problem lies in the construction of the seat, which is mounted on springs. So in theory his head would have hit the roof, even if he were attached to it.\n[6] On June 4, 2002, Mr. Smith was given a letter from his physiotherapist saying he was fit to go back to work. He took the letter to S & S Delivery. An hour and a half later, he received a call telling him that there was a letter from the company in the office. The letter was from Mr. Slobodian and indicated that there was a new drug policy. Mr. Smith would not be accepted back at work until he took a drug test.\n[7] Mr. Slobodian states that he instituted the drug policy while Mr. Smith was on compensation. There is more to it, however. Mr. Slobodian candidly says that he was hoping that Mr. Smith would fail the drug test. He had seen him come into the yard with bloodshot eyes. Mr. Slobodian nevertheless states that other employees were asked for drug tests.\n[8] Mr. Smith thinks there was no drug policy. He says no one else was tested. I do not know if there was a real policy; if there was, it was more ad hoc than it should have been. It was nevertheless apparent, even at the hearing, that Mr. Slobodian has a temper. Mr. Slobodian says that he and Mr. Smith constantly butted heads. I think Mr. Smith agrees.\n[9] Mr. Slobodian had a problem with Mr. Smith\u2019s attitude. He says that he heard from customers that Mr. Smith was saying things about his operations and his equipment. He mentioned a call from someone at Revelstoke. Mr. Slobodian had six weeks to think about it, while Mr. Smith was on Worker\u2019s Compensation. He didn\u2019t want Mr. Smith back.\n[10] Mr. Smith refused to budge. He took the position that he was still an employee of S & S Delivery. He went to a doctor and requested a drug test. The results were given to Mr. Slobodian on June 11th. They were negative. Mr. Smith asked for work. Mr. Slobodian said he would call him. He never did.\n[11] Mr. Smith phoned the office a number of times. At the end of June, he saw a newspaper ad in the StarPhoenix from S & S looking for a driver. So he knew there was work. Mr. Smith tried to contact Mr. Slobodian, without success. Communications ceased. There was another ad in August.\n[12] The fight was not over. Mr. Smith went to Labour Standards at the end of June. Neil Klassen, the labour standards officer, said that he was entitled to two weeks pay in lieu of notice. Mr. Klassen discussed the matter with S & S and after legal threats from the Respondent, and an appeal, Mr. Smith received a cheque for two weeks pay. At the end of August, he filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[13] Mr. Smith now wants his wages for the period between June and September. Mr. Slobodian feels that this is piling on. Mr. Smith has already collected twelve thousand dollars from Worker\u2019s Compensation and something like 1500 dollars for salary in lieu of notice. Although he does not cite any law, Mr. Slobodian argues that Mr. Smith accepted that the job was over in June, when he went to Labour Standards in June and requested pay in lieu of notice.\n[14] There may be something to this line of argument. Mr. Smith said that all Mr. Slobodian had to do was tell him, face to face, that he was terminated. He insisted on this, however. Mr. Slobodian conceded at the hearing that he should have been more forthright when Mr. Smith came to see him on June 5th. He should have told Mr. Smith that he was terminating his employment. He should have paid him the salary in lieu of notice. But he does not think it is fair to ask anything more of him.\nIII. Law and Analysis [15] The complaint was laid under section 7 and section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 10 refers to an employment policy or practice. The argument is that the drug policy, if there was one, discriminated against those with a dependency on drugs.\n[16] Mr. Smith had little if anything to say on this aspect of the case, and I cannot see any reason to discuss it. Both men agreed that drug testing is standard in the industry, at least for drivers who cross the border into the United States. In Milazzo v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Motor Coach Canada, 2005 CHRT 5, the Tribunal recognized the legitimacy of such conditions in the transportation industry.\n[17] The real issue lies under section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That provision states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual . . . on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[18] The allegation is that S & S refused to continue Mr. Smith\u2019s employment on the basis that he might use drugs.\n[19] The facts do not support this kind of assertion. The situation might be different if there was evidence that Mr. Slobodian had a prejudice against drivers who might have used drugs. As it stands, however, the evidence merely suggests that Mr. Slobodian didn\u2019t want Mr. Smith coming back to work. They had become enemies. The drug test was really beside the point. It was merely a ruse, a ploy to keep Mr. Smith out of the company.\n[20] The problem goes deeper, however. I cannot see how Mr. Slobodian\u2019s conduct comes within the meaning of the term discrimination. The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary states that discrimination consists, in one sense, of treating someone differently on a basis other than individual merit. It then gives two examples: to discriminate in favor of your friends and to discriminate against a certain nationality.\n[21] The Compact Oxford Dictionary provides a similar definition. It states that discrimination consists of making an unjust distinction in the treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, sex, or age. This reflects the contemporary legal use of the word. The idea is that a person is being treated differently because he is a member of a certain group.\n[22] The complaint alleges that Mr. Slobodian refused to continue to employ Mr. Smith because he thought that he used drugs. I cannot see this. All of the evidence suggests that the dispute between Mr. Smith and Mr. Slobodian was entirely personal. Mr. Slobodian never liked Mr. Smith. He thought that Mr. Smith lied when he filed his claim with Worker\u2019s Compensation. Mr. Slobodian may have been wrong in this; he admits that he has no proof, but the point is that his resentment was specific to Mr. Smith. It did not relate to his membership in a group.\n[23] There might be an argument that Mr. Slobodian treated Mr. Smith differently because of the accident. This might be construed as discrimination on the basis of a disability. I suppose it is possible that Mr. Slobodian had it in for anyone who was unlucky enough to be injured on the job. Perhaps he saw this as a mark against his company. Or was concerned about the financial implications. This is mere speculation however.\n[24] In the circumstances, I do not think that the case falls under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. This is a private dispute, between two men who dislike each other. Mr. Smith may or may not have grounds for a lawsuit. But that is another matter. The Complainant has not established that he was treated differently because he was a member of an identifiable group. There are none of the comparisons that the law of equality requires. This is essential.\n[25] The Tribunal is not a court. There is a public interest component in the human rights process, which distinguishes it from private litigation. This is true, even when the issues are, for all practical purposes, exclusive to the parties. The point is fundamental. The human rights process engages larger interests, which concern everyone in society. It should not be used, for the purpose of trying a private claim in contracts or some other area of the law.\n[26] I am not sure that I can say that much to appease either of the parties. I think that Mr. Smith and Mr. Slobodian probably need to move on to other things in their lives. The complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario March 2, 2005\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T962\/8204\nStyle of Cause: Fred Smith v.

I have already ruled on the matter in Brown v. RCMP, 2004 CHRT 30, where I found that the Tribunal had a residual power to award costs. After reviewing the submissions on both sides, I find myself in the same position in the present case.\n[2] The Respondent has relied principally on Digby Municipal School Board v. CUPE, Local 118 (1982), 135 D.L.R. (3d) 582 (N.S.C.A.), which was upheld by the Supreme Court at (1983), 1 D.L.R. (4th) 1. Although the Digby decision dealt with the jurisdiction of the Labour Relations Board, it contains a convincing account of the older law. This body of law stipulates that an adjudicative body with statutory authority has no power to award costs unless the legislation bestows it with that power.\n[3] I am familiar with this jurisprudence. As it turns out, the Respondent has also relied on my decision in Brown, at para. 70, where I said:\nThe power to award costs cannot be found in the Act. It is simply not there . . . If Parliament had intended to give the Tribunal the power to award costs, it would have done so, in accordance with the rules and conventions governing the matter.\nI naturally accept this assertion. I agree that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not give the Tribunal the express jurisdiction to award costs.\n[4] That is not the end of the matter. I have to take issue with the position taken by the Respondent in paragraph 12 of its submissions, where it states:\nHuman rights legislation in most provinces contains express provisions with respect to costs. This confirms that when the legislature intends to grant a human rights tribunal the jurisdiction to award costs, it does so expressly. In the absence of an express provision, Parliament must not have intended the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to award costs.\nI do not agree that the second proposition follows from the first.\n[5] The point is that I limited my remarks, in Brown, to the assertion that Parliament did not intend to give the Tribunal a power to award costs in the circumstances that existed at the time the legislation was drafted. It may be a fine point, but this does not mean that it intended to deprive the Tribunal of such a power in the circumstances that exist in Brown and the present case. The practice of the Human Rights Commission has evolved over time and the situation is not the same as it was, when the legislation was passed.\n[6] It will be apparent that my ruling is restricted to those cases in which the Commission does not appear. Although Parliament did not give the Tribunal an express power to award costs, I think there is a negative thought in the Act that suffices to demonstrate its intentions. One of those intentions, at least in those cases where the Commission appears, is that a successful Complainant will not be burdened by legal fees. I think it is somewhat arbitrary to make a distinction between Complainants who have the benefit of the Commission's presence and those who are required, by force of circumstances, to retain their own lawyer.\n[7] It comes down to a matter of representation. The law of human rights has become relatively complex, and the experience of the Tribunal in dealing with lay litigants has demonstrated that the efficacy of the process depends to some extent on the assistance of counsel. This is particularly true in the circumstances of the present case, which involved a detailed review of Mr. Brooks' employment history. In a case where the Commission decides not to appear, it seems to me that a Complainant is entitled to legal representation. It follows that someone must pay for that representation.\n[8] Mr. Bagambiire is reluctant about the public release of his accounts. I think it is important however that the reality of the situation be put squarely before the Federal Court, should the matter be reviewed. Mr. Brooks has been awarded five thousand dollars for hurt feelings, the maximum under the old Act, on the consent of the parties. I do not know what the costs would be, after taxation, but the accounts that have been entered into evidence certainly suggest that the Complainant's legal fees could reach a hundred thousand dollars.\n[9] I think this is enough to make anyone pause. The failure of the Tribunal to award costs in the present case would not only penalize a successful Complainant. It would also discourage complainants from coming forward in the future. It seems to me that this runs counter to both the plan of the Act and the existing jurisprudence. I cannot see how the Tribunal can endorse a situation where a successful Complainant incurs a loss, as a result of legal fees that must be paid to bring a matter to a successful conclusion. This would defeat the purposes of the legislation.\n[10] The caselaw establishes that the principle of recovery under the Act is restitutio in integrum. The provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act relating to remedy are extremely broad and contemplate that a successful complainant will recover any and all expenses related to the litigation. I cannot bring myself, as a point of law, to interpret the word expenses in a way that includes legal fees. It nevertheless strikes me as rather strained to suggest that Parliament went out of its way to ensure that a Complainant would recover all of his expenses but none of his legal fees, in a case where he clearly needs a lawyer.\n[11] I should note that the Respondent also raises a more technical issue. It is evident, from Banca Nazionale v. Lee-Shanok, [1988] F.C.J. No. 594 (QL) and Oasis Hotel Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co. [1981] B.C.J. No. 690 (QL), both of which I cite in Brown, that there is another source of the power to award costs. This comes from equity. The question is whether the remedies available to a successful Complainant under the Canadian Human Rights Act can be described as equitable. The Respondent says no.\n[12] It is true that the Tribunal is a statutory body, which only has the powers granted to it under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Act is remedial, however. It deals with human rights, which are also known as the rights of the person. This law is not part of the ordinary law. It is fundamental. The significance of this law has been recognized in the domestic and international arena. It forms part of the jus cogens.\n[13] This is where the Respondent's analysis founders. The principal decision cited by the Respondent, Digby Municipal School Board v. CUPE, supra, falls outside the law of human rights. Although the courts are in a better position to decide the equitable issue, it seems to me that the subject matter of the Canadian Human Rights Act distinguishes it from other pieces of legislation. It is well settled law that a literal approach is out of place in the context of the Act. I do not think that Parliament intended that the law of equality would be frustrated by an overly fastidious reading of the niceties of the legislation.\n[14] I think the Tribunal has an obligation to protect the efficacy and integrity of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The entire purpose of the Act is to provide a meaningful remedy for those who have suffered discrimination. I do not see how this is possible, at least in a case where the Commission decides not to appear, without an award of costs. The idea that a complainant who has been discriminated against should be required to pay something in the order of a hundred thousand dollars, for a five thousand dollar claim, and the full gamut of hardship that comes with litigation, is untenable. The cure is worse than the disease.\n[15] Although the provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms might have some bearing on the question before me, this was never raised by the parties. I will accordingly leave it for others to investigate this aspect of the matter.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 10, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT838\/8803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCecil Brooks v.

Grant Sinclair Pierre Deschamps\n2005 CHRT 15 2005\/01\/28\n[1] Bell has brought a motion requesting that the proposed expert testimony of Dr. Lawrence Gould not be received in evidence by the Tribunal because the subject of his testimony is one within the Tribunal's own knowledge and experience. In support of its motion, Bell relies on the Mohan decision and argues that Dr. Gould's testimony or evidence is not necessary to assist the Tribunal in making a final determination on the issue of interest.\n[2] Under section 53(4) of the CHRA, as we have discussed this many times in the last few days, the Tribunal may make an award of interest and determine the rate of interest and the period of interest that it considers appropriate subject to Rule 9.12 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, which provides for a specific rate and an interest period unless the Tribunal orders otherwise. CEP has come here asking that the Tribunal order otherwise and relies on Dr. Gould's expert evidence to establish the rate and method of calculation of interest as it should apply in this particular case.\n[3] Dr. Gould has been qualified as an expert in finance by this Tribunal. In doing so, the Tribunal heard evidence from Dr. Gould that the matters of interest and the method of calculation of interest are an integral part of finance and financial expertise, as he has described it. On the basis of this evidence and evidence of his academic qualifications and experience, he was accepted as an expert to testify with respect to the appropriate interest rate and method of calculation.\n[4] Section 50(3)(c) of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal may receive and accept any evidence and other information that the Tribunal sees fit whether or not that information would be admissible as evidence in a court of law subject to the law of privilege. In our view, as we indicated yesterday when the motion was being argued, this is the starting point for determining the admissibility of expert evidence.\n[5] Going back to Mohan, it sets out four criteria to be considered with respect to the admissibility of expert evidence. Those are: (a) relevance, (b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact, (c) the absence of any exclusionary rule and (d) a properly qualified expert. At this point (a), (c) and (d) are not in issue and only (b) is the question that has to be determined. In our opinion, in light of section 50(3)(c) of the Act, Mohan is not strictly transferrable when the question of the admissibility of expert testimony arises before the Tribunal.\n[6] However, given the facts of this case, the nature of Dr. Gould's proposed evidence and without elaborating any further on how section 50(3)(c) interacts with Mohan, we are satisfied that the Mohan criteria can be used here and criteria (b) is answered in favour of admitting Dr. Gould's expert evidence.\n[7] With respect to the necessity in assisting the trier of fact, the Court stated in Mohan that what is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury or the trier of fact. In making that statement, the Court also referred to the case of R. v. Abbey. In that case, the Court said the evidence must be necessary so the trier of fact can appreciate the technical nature of the matters in issue.\n[8] In our view, because of the complexity of the questions that Dr. Gould proposes to deal with and the issues to be decided, the Tribunal has concluded that his expert testimony will be useful to assist the Tribunal in deciding the issues that arise with respect to an appropriate award of interest.

INTRODUCTION [1] On February 10, 2005, the Respondent, the Canadian Armed Forces, brought a preliminary motion to have the complaint of Terry Buffett (the Complainant) dismissed. It is the Respondent's position that the alleged discrimination does not constitute a denial of an employment benefit on one of the enumerated grounds under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, c. H-6. It argues that since there is no employment relationship between the Respondent and the Complainant's spouse, the conduct does not fall within the course of employment. Furthermore, the Respondent adds that the provision of benefits to only its members under the Canadian Forces Health Services Plan is a distinction based solely on employment status which is not an enumerated ground under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Respondent further indicated that the provision of insured health care benefits by the Canadian Armed Forces is not an employment practice or policy related to employment opportunities and it does not, therefore, fall within the jurisdiction of section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] At the preliminary hearing, the Respondent also raised the issue of whether the Complainant had met the legal test for proving a prima facie case of discrimination.\nII. THE FACTS [4] For the purpose of the preliminary motion, the parties have agreed to the following facts.\nA. The Canadian Health Care System [5] By virtue of the Constitution Act, and as expressed in the Canada Health Act, Canada has a system of universal health care in which all provinces are responsible for the provision of essential health care to residents with financial contribution from the Federal Government.\n[6] The only exception to this system is those groups of persons falling directly under the control of the Federal Government, including the Canadian Armed Forces, who are exempted from coverage by the Provincial Health Care Plan.\n[7] The Constitution Act places responsibility upon the Federal Government for providing health care to members of the Canadian Armed Forces at public expense. The Respondent provides its members with comprehensive health care comparable to that guaranteed under the Canada Health Act. The health care services provided by the Respondent stand in the same position and have the same role as the Provincial Health Care Plan.\nB. The Canadian Armed Forces Health Services [8] The Canadian Forces Health Care Plan operates under the direction of the Canadian Forces Health Services Group, which is responsible for the delivery of health services to members of the Canadian Armed Forces.\n[9] The Respondent has developed a large infrastructure for the provision of services inside and outside Canada and operates on an annual budget in excess of 728 million dollars.\n[10] The Respondent strives to provide its members with access to the same health care that the average canadian would expect; however the Respondent also has added health care delivery requirements associated with the operational nature of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Respondent has a core of uniformed medical professionals and it also employs a number of civilian medical experts on a contractual basis to provide care to its members. It provides enhanced primary care services, including coverage for family doctor care, laboratories, mental health coverage, full pharmaceutical coverage, physiotherapy, social work and dental care.\n[11] The Respondent also relies on various agreements with civilian health care agencies to assist in providing comprehensive health care to its members. Where it is necessary for a member to utilize the services of a civilian medical professional, the civilian agency submits an invoice to the Respondent for payment.\nC. Canadian Forces Spectrum of Care Policy [12] The Canadian Forces Spectrum of Care Policy describes the health care benefits and services that are available and publicly funded for members of the Canadian Armed Forces. The five principles which are considered in determining the scope of benefit coverage are:\nthe benefit is necessary for the purposes of maintaining health and mental well being, preventing disease; diagnosing or treating injury, illness or disability; the benefit sustains or restores a serving member to be an operationally effective and deployable member of the Respondent; the benefit adheres to the scientific principle of evidence - based medicine; the benefit is not for purely experimental, research or cosmetic purposes; and the benefit is funded by a single province of federal agency.\n[13] There is also a process within the Canadian Forces Health Services Group whereby requests for funding medical procedures, not covered by the Respondent's Health Care Plan, may be made by Canadian Armed Forces members and considered by the Respondent.\nD. Dependant Care [14] The Respondent does not have a program for publicly funded health care for families of its members and does not have the legislative mandate to provide medical coverage for non-members of the Canadian Armed Forces. Spouses and children of its members receive medical coverage through the Provincial Health Services Plan in the province in which they reside or through the Public Service Health Care Plan.\n[15] There are a number of limited and exceptional circumstances in which the Respondent's medical personnel may provide medical treatment to family members of its personnel. These are limited to emergency situations in remote locations or where families accompany a member to positions outside of Canada.\nE. The Complainant [16] The Complainant holds the rank of Sergeant in the Regular Force of the Canadian Armed Forces. He is currently posted at CFB Gagetown, in the province of New Brunswick and receives health care through the Respondent's Health Services Plan. Rhonda Buffett, his wife, is not a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She is a resident of the province of New Brunswick and at the relevant time was covered by the New Brunswick Medicare Plan.\n[17] The Complainant and his wife have had difficulty conceiving. The Complainant's wife suffered four miscarriages early in their marriage. Following these difficulties the couple went through medical investigation to determine the cause of the problem. This medical investigation for the Complainant was covered by the Respondent's health plan. The investigation revealed that the Complainant was suffering from male factor infertility.\n[18] The Complainant underwent further medical treatment for his condition. He received varicocele, surgery which was funded by the Respondent's health plan. Medication, the only other treatment for his condition, was not recommended in his circumstances.\n[19] His physician recommended In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) as his spouse's best chance at becoming pregnant. In IVF, physicians prescribe medication to the female to stimulate the production of multiple eggs, which are then retrieved from the ovaries and incubated. The sperm sample is then mixed with the woman's eggs in a Petri dish. If conception occurs a small number of the resulting embryos are placed in the female's uterus.\n[20] ICSI may be used with immotile sperm during In Vitro Fertilization. In ICSI, a sperm sample is assessed under a microscope. A single sperm is selected from the sample and injected, with a needle, directly into an egg. The fertilized egg is placed in an incubator. The resulting embryo is implanted into the female's uterus.\n[21] The Complainant requested funding from the Respondent for his wife to have IVF with ICSI.\n[22] The Respondent's Spectrum of Care Policy provides the following treatments for infertility:\ninvestigation, medication, surgical treatment, artificial insemination, and in vitro fertilization. However funding will be provided in this case only\nif the infertility is the result of double fallopian tube obstruction, for a maximum of three cycles, and to serving members, not to civilian dependents, spouses or partners of serving members.\n[23] The Complainant's request was denied because the beneficiary of the funding was not a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. In other words he was denied funding for IVF and ICSI because his wife is not a member of the Canadian Armed Forces and the IVF with ICSI can only be performed on a woman. If she had been a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, the agreed statement of facts indicates that her request would also have been denied because the treatment requested did not fall into the specific provision for funding, since she did not have double fallopian tube blockage.\n[24] The Respondent's coverage for infertility is the same as the coverage offered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and the Public Service Health Care Plan. No other provincial health care plan covers the cost of IVF. There are currently no medical insurance plans in Canada which cover the costs of ICSI.\n[25] Mrs. Buffet did request funding from the New Brunswick Medicare plan for IVF with ICSI but was denied. She also requested funding through the Public Service Health Care Plan and was also denied.\n[26] On May 23, 2002, the Complainant filed his human rights complaint asserting that providing funding to only female members of the Canadian Armed Forces, who suffer from fallopian tube obstruction, is discriminatory on the basis of sex, disability, and family status contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. On February 3, 2004, he amended his complaint to add that the Respondent had applied a discriminatory policy contrary to section 10 of the Act.\nIII. THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS [27] The Respondent referred to the complex set of Federal and Provincial legislation, which govern the provision of universal insured health services in Canada. It also made reference to the National Defence Act, R.S. 1985, c. N-5, which defines the Respondent's organization, administration and responsibilities. Pursuant to subsection 12(2) of this Act, the Minister responsible has the authority to make regulations for the administration and good government of the Canadian Armed Forces. Pursuant to this subsection the Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces, chap, 34, (the Regulation) was adopted. This regulation sets out the requirements regarding provision of health services to members of the Canadian Armed Forces.\n[28] Subsection 34.07(4) of the Regulation indicates that medical care shall be provided to all members of the Canadian Armed Forces at public expense. Furthermore, subsection 34.23 states that medical services may only be provided to dependents in very limited circumstances. Family members are normally requested to access insured health services through the provincial government where they reside. In the case of the Complainant's wife this would be the province of New Brunswick. The dependants are also eligible for third party insurance coverage through the Public Service Health Care Plan.\n[29] The Respondent, after setting out the legislative framework, spoke of the well known principle that in a discrimination case it is up to the Complainant to establish a prima facie case. In the case of this complaint this means that the Complainant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the actions of the Respondent constitute an employment practice which creates a distinction based on a prohibited ground. Once this prima facie case is established then the burden of proof shifts to the Respondent to show, on a balance of probabilities, a bona fide justification for its practices in relation to the Complainant.\n[30] According to the Respondent the claim under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act should be denied because the refusal to fund the medical procedure was not in the course of the Complainant's employment. In this case, the Complainant, as an employee of the Canadian Armed Forces, requested funding for a medical procedure to be performed on his wife. Therefore, according to the Respondent, there has been no benefit denied to the Complainant by his employer in respect of his employment relationship, but rather, there has been a refusal to extend funding for medical procedures to the Complainant's wife.\n[31] The Respondent goes on to argue that pursuant to the legislative scheme described above, a non-member is not entitled to coverage under its medical plan and given that the benefit requested was for a non-member, this complaint is not related to a differentiation based on employment.\n[32] It is also the Respondent's position that the claim under section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act should be denied because its Health Services Plan, and the related Spectrum of Care Policy, does not deprive the Complainant or any other employee of an employment opportunity. According to the Respondent, health care benefits and services are not an employment opportunity as defined by the Act. It adds that employment opportunities are ways by which an employee is hired, promoted and trained within an organization. The Respondent argues that the purpose of section 10 is to prevent employers from having discriminatory practices or policies which affect the way they hire, train or promote employees.\nIV. THE COMMISSION'S ARGUMENTS [33] According to the Commission, the Respondent's arguments do not take into account the seriousness and the complexity of the complaint. It fails to take into account that the complaint is that of Sgt. Buffett, a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, and not the complaint of his spouse. The Complainant alleges that he has been discriminated against on the basis of the Respondent's application of its Health Care Plan. For the Commission, the complaint raises a host of other questions going beyond the single issue of funding for a medical procedure.\n[34] The Commission asserts that the Tribunal should not dismiss this complaint without a hearing and that the Respondent's request for dismissal does not meet the test set out in previous decisions where the Tribunal has stated that it should exercise its jurisdiction to dismiss a complaint only in the clearest of cases.\n[35] Although the parties have come to an agreement on certain facts for the purpose of this preliminary hearing, the Commission maintains that they also agreed that they would be able to expand on these facts at a full hearing of the matter.\n[36] The issues raised by the Complainant are, according to the Commission, live and complex issues. They cannot be narrowly boiled down to a question of whether or not the Complainant's spouse ought to be covered by the health benefit plan. The Commission consequently requests that the Respondent's application be dismissed.\nV. THE ISSUES ON THE PRELIMINARY MOTION [37] In its preliminary motion, the Respondent asks that the complaint be dismissed on the basis :\nthat its refusal to fund the medical procedure did not constitute a denial of an employment benefit on one of the enumerated ground of section 7 of the Act; that the Complainant cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination; that the provision of insured health care benefits is not an employment practice or policy related to employment opportunities and does not, therefore, fall within the jurisdiction of section 10 of the Act.\nVI. THE DECISION [38] Subsections 49(1) and 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, provides:\n49(1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n50(1) After due notice to the Commission the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n[39] Taking into consideration the obligation set out in the Act that all parties should be given a full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry and present evidence and make representations, the Tribunal is of the opinion that it should exercise cautiously its jurisdiction to dismiss a complaint at a preliminary stage. As it was stated by my colleague Paul Groarke in Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation, (2002\/09\/30 - Ruling No. 1), at paragraph 83: It would undermine the remedial character of human rights legislation, which calls for a large and liberal interpretation, to curtail the right of complainants to a hearing.\n[40] Accordingly, I agree with my colleague that the power of the Tribunal to dismiss a case at a preliminary stage should only be exercised in the clearest of cases. Does it make any difference that the parties have agreed to some facts for the purpose of the motion? I do not believe so in regard to the parties' own admission that they could expand on these facts at the hearing of the complaint.\n[41] At the hearing on the motion, the parties and the Tribunal had the following exchange:\nMR. PAGOWSKI: I'd make just one further submission. This just arises out of something that my friend has said, it doesn't go to the substance.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: No.\nMR. PAGOWSKI: My friend and I have had correspondence -- I'm sure my friend would agree with me here -- we've had correspondence on the issue of the factual background that would have formed this particular motion, and we had agreed that -- that that context -- the factual basis may well be expanded at the time that we get to the Tribunal hearing. So only for the purposes of this -\nMS RICHARDS: Yes.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Because I did understand that at the last conference call, when I have said I thought the parties had agreed on all the facts, and both of you did indicate that you could expand on the facts if there was a hearing.\nMS RICHARDS: Absolutely, and I didn't intend to mislead you in regards to that.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: No, I understand that.\n[42] The matters raised by the Respondent in its motion are certainly very important. They raise significant issues of public interest which could have an impact well beyond the present complaint. In fairness to all the parties, the Tribunal feels that these matters should be dealt with at a full hearing of the matter during which all parties will have the opportunity to present their evidence and make legal representations. It would not be in the parties' best interest that these issues be dealt with expeditiously as a preliminary motion, certainly not when all the facts have not been submitted.\n[43] The preliminary motion of the Respondent is dismissed and the matter will proceed to a full hearing on the merits. The parties will provide forthwith to the Tribunal their dates of availability for a hearing of one week in the month of May or June 2005. They will also exchange and file with the Tribunal a final list of their witnesses with a resum of the evidence that these witnesses will be giving at the hearing. The parties will also conform themselves with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure in regards to expert evidence, if any. The Tribunal is also available to deal with any matter arising from this decision or any other preliminary matters that the parties would want to raise prior to the hearing.\nSigned by Michel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 21, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT976\/9604\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTerry Buffett v.

Hadjis\n2005 CHRT 17 2005\/03\/21\nI. BACKGROUND\nII. ANALYSIS\n[1] The Respondent, the Canadian Museum of Civilization (the Museum) has brought a preliminary motion requesting that the Tribunal dismiss the complaint insofar as it alleges a breach of s. 11 of the Act. In the alternative, the Museum seeks an order compelling the Complainant, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396) (the Union), to provide detailed particulars of its s. 11 complaint.\nI. BACKGROUND [2] On March 6, 2000, the Union filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) alleging that the Museum uses a job evaluation plan that is flawed and results in the underpayment of female jobs in relation to male jobs of comparable value, in contravention of ss. 10 and 11 of the Act. The Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal on April 1, 2004.\n[3] The Museum's employees were at one time classified according to the Treasury Board Standard, which sorted jobs into various occupational groups including the CR and GT groups. It is alleged in the complaint that the CR group was composed of predominantly female jobs and that the GT group was made up predominantly of male jobs. On April 1, 1997, the Museum implemented a new job evaluation plan. The Union claims that the plan differentiates adversely against female jobs in comparison to male jobs of equal value. Certain factors that are known to measure aspects of jobs that are typically female are allegedly absent from the plan, and conversely, other factors that typically favour predominantly male jobs are taken into consideration by the plan.\n[4] An interesting characteristic of the new plan is that jobs are no longer divided into occupational groups. Instead, each job is individually assessed and, depending on its point rating, is assigned to one of several levels. Wage ranges increase in proportion to the assigned level.\n[5] The complaint form contains a table purporting to demonstrate that after the conversion to the new plan, all of the employees in the female-dominated CR jobs were given designations between levels 2 and 4, whereas only 16.7% of the male-dominated GT positions were rated at level 4 or lower. The remaining GT employees were ranked between levels 5 and 8, of which 43% were ranked at level 6. The highest maximum salary at level 4 (as indicated in the table) was $37,737.82, while the maximum available wage at level 6 was $49,111.11.\n[6] The complaint alleges that the male bias illustrated in these results was confirmed by an evaluation of a random mix of seven predominantly female and seven predominantly male jobs using a gender-neutral job evaluation plan jointly developed by the Public Service Alliance of Canada (the PSAC) and Deloite & Touche. The results allegedly demonstrate that two female jobs that were rated equal to two male jobs under the employer's new plan, were higher rated than the male jobs when assessed under the gender-neutral plan. Similarly, the review found that three predominantly male jobs that were higher rated than three other female jobs under the new plan, were given ratings that were equivalent or slightly lower than the female jobs, when assessed under the gender-neutral plan.\n[7] It is important to note here that the complaint form does not specify which jobs were the objects of this random assessment. In addition, the Union does not indicate which predominantly female jobs are undervalued when compared to the predominantly male jobs. This alleged omission in the complaint lies at the core of the Museum's present motion.\n[8] The Museum points out that although there is some reference in the complaint to CR and GT jobs, these classifications ceased to exist on April 1, 1997. The alleged discriminatory practice relates to the new job evaluation plan under which there is no breakdown of occupational groups.\n[9] The Museum contends that without a particularization of the female complainant group and the male comparator counterpart, the Union's claim of discrimination under s. 11 cannot be substantiated, especially when taking into account the Equal Wage Guidelines, 1986, SOR\/86-1082, (the Guidelines) adopted pursuant to s. 27(2) of the Act. According to s. 12 of the Guidelines, where a complaint alleging differences in wages is filed by or on behalf of an identifiable occupational group, the group must be predominantly of one sex and the group to which it is compared must be predominantly of the other sex. The Museum claims that in order to comply with this provision, both the complainant group and its male comparator group must be precisely identified.\n[10] The Museum maintains that the present complaint does not conform to the Guidelines because it fails to identify the complainant and comparator occupational groups. Moreover, claims the employer, this omission constitutes a denial of its right to know the case it must meet and is in breach of the minimum requirements of procedural fairness.\n[11] The Museum has over the years repeatedly conveyed its concerns regarding the lack of particularization of these occupational groups to the Union and the Commission. A first reference appears in the Museum's initial response to the complaint, communicated to the other parties in June 2000. The same misgivings were reiterated as recently as August 2004, in a Statement of Case filed by the Museum in preparation for a case management meeting. The Museum notes that at no time along the way did the Union or the Commission provide it with the requested details. An expert's report obtained by the Commission (the Haignire Report), released in June 2003, studied whether the new classification plan tended to deprive women of employment opportunities, in breach of s. 10 of the Act. The findings of this report were later incorporated into the Commission investigator's report. In the Museum's view, neither the expert nor the Commission investigator looked into nor reported on any s. 11 contravention. The expert's report did review several specific jobs, which were identified as either female or male, but no comparison was done of these jobs' values or relative rates of pay. The investigation report recommended that a tribunal be appointed to inquire into the s. 11 portion of the complaint, but did not state which were the complainant and comparator groups.\n[12] The Union for its part mentioned in its Statement of Case dated July 9, 2004, that it was relying on the male-dominated and female-dominated occupational groups as defined in terms of job titles and commonality of duties and responsibilities. The Museum contends that this declaration did not provide it with any further insight as to the identification of the complainant and comparator occupational groups.\n[13] The issue re-emerged during the ensuing case management meeting that was conducted by the Tribunal Chairperson on August 20, 2004. Following some discussion, the Museum undertook to communicate to the other parties the point factor weightings and the sub-factor weighting scales that were applied in the implementation of the new job classification plan. Counsel for the Union had explained at the meeting that without this data, it would be difficult for his client to provide any particularization regarding the groups. After receiving this information, the Union's counsel addressed a letter dated October 15, 2004, to the Museum's counsel, in an effort to clarify the position of the Complainant on the position of complainant and comparator groups for purposes of the section 11 portion of the [...] complaint. He went on to list in his letter eleven female-dominated groups and nine male-dominated groups. At the hearing into the present motion, conducted on February 22, 2005, counsel for the Union elaborated on this statement. He confirmed the Union's position that, subject to any change in the data, each of the listed female groups constitutes a discrete, predominantly female complainant group. He added that the combined list of male occupational groups comprises a single male comparator group, in accordance with s. 14 of the Guidelines. Section 14 provides that where the comparison is being made to two or more occupational groups, those groups are deemed to be one group.\n[14] The Museum points out that the jobs listed in the October 15th letter do not correspond to any previously declared enumeration of jobs. In particular, the PSAC\/Deloitte & Touche review of the new plan that is referenced in the complaint alluded to a different set of jobs. The occupations catalogued in a schedule attached to the Haignire Report do not correspond to those in the newer list either. For that matter, it would appear that the October 15th list does not even match the breakdown of jobs as delineated by the old CR and GT classifications. The Museum contends that the Union is now in effect attempting to amend its complaint.\n[15] In sum, the Museum alleges that by failing to identify the complainant and comparator groups, the s. 11 portion of the complaint does not comply with the Guidelines and is therefore invalid. As such, the Museum argues that it does not know the case it has to meet, and to require it to respond to the complaint would constitute a breach of fundamental fairness and natural justice. Alternatively, the Museum contends that the incorporation of the job titles into the complaint through the October 15th letter amounts to an amendment of the complaint that is impermissible on account of the resulting prejudice to the Museum. In addition, the Museum submits that the complaint, as amended by the October 15th letter, makes a fundamentally new complaint, which is not the one referred to the Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to inquire this new complaint.\nII. ANALYSIS [16] I have difficulty accepting the premise that the complaint is invalid. The complaint sets out a series of facts that are alleged to constitute discrimination on the basis of sex. There can be no doubt, upon reading the text, about what is being alleged. Simply put, it is claimed that the Museum adopted a job evaluation plan in 1997 that was inherently gender-biased in its formulation and application. This bias resulted in female-dominated jobs being undervalued when compared to male-dominated jobs. In order to substantiate these allegations, it is plain that the Commission and the Union will have to establish that the bias in the plan exists and that the bias has resulted in the undervaluation of female jobs. As for remedy, it will have to be demonstrated that on account of this undervaluation, the wages of employees in those female jobs were less than they would have been had an unbiased plan been used. Compensation for this wage gap would have to be calculated. This is in essence the complaint alleged. It is up to the Union and Commission to lead their evidence and make their case.\n[17] A given set of facts could in theory constitute a breach of more than one provision of the Act. For instance, an employer practice that deprived an employee of an employment opportunity on the basis of a prohibited ground (a violation of s. 10) could at the same time also constitute adverse differential treatment of that employee (a breach of s. 7). In the correspondence between the Union and the Commission prior to the filing of the present complaint, there was in fact some debate about whether the claim should be made under ss. 7, 10, and\/or 11 of the Act.\n[18] In the case of Canada (Attorney General) v. Robinson, [1994] 3 F.C. 228 at paras. 37-39, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that in conducting its inquiry, a Tribunal should not be pre-occupied with the enumeration in the complaint of the provisions of the Act that were allegedly breached. The matter before the Court in that case related to a Tribunal decision in which one of the respondent's policies was found to be in violation of s. 10 of the Act. The complaint, however, had only alleged a s. 7 violation. The Court held this fact to be irrelevant noting that human rights complaint forms are not to be perused in the same manner as criminal indictments. What was important for the Court was that the facts brought before the Tribunal proved the policy to be discriminatory, whether in violation of s. 7 or s.10.\n[19] The rationale for not adopting too narrow or technical an approach in perusing complaint forms was articulated in a recent ruling from the Tribunal in the case of Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, [2005] CHRT 1 at para. 10. The Tribunal observed that the complaint form exists primarily for the purposes of the Commission. It is a necessary first step, which raises a set of facts that calls for further investigation. The form is inherently approximate and was never intended to serve the purposes of a pleading in the adjudicative process leading to a hearing. It is the Statement of Particulars (ordinarily filed pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure), rather than the original complaint, that sets the more precise terms of the hearing.\n[20] In the present instance, the Statements of Particulars have yet to be filed. Nonetheless, the Union has provided additional details, not only by way of its Statement of Case submitted in preparation for the August 2004 case management meeting, but more importantly, through the letter of October 15, 2004. Counsel for the Union further elaborated upon these particulars during oral arguments on the motion. In my view, these additional details complete any information that the Museum alleges was lacking from the complaint form in relation to the claim under s. 11. To order the Union and the Commission to provide any further particulars would go beyond what is required for the purposes of pleadings. As was noted in PSAC v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 9 at para. 7 (CHRT), parties are only obliged to set out the material facts on which they are relying in pleading their cases - they are not required to plead evidence. I am satisfied that the information given to the Museum is sufficient for it to know the case that it must meet. I am also satisfied that the details provided do not constitute an amendment to the original complaint but merely further particulars relating to the existing complaint.\n[21] The matter does not end there, however. These particulars were provided fairly recently. The October 15, 2004, letter was issued about six months after the case was referred to the Tribunal and the final clarification regarding the female complainant groups was made four months later at the motion hearing. The issue, therefore, is whether the Museum is somehow prejudiced by the disclosure having come at this stage in the process.\n[22] In its written submissions on the motion, the Museum alleged that it would be significantly prejudiced if it were required to proceed to a hearing in respect to what it described as new allegations. As I have indicated, I do not consider the details provided to the Museum since the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal as new allegations, but rather as further particulars regarding the existing complaint. Assuming that these details were communicated somewhat tardily, what is the prejudice to the Museum?\n[23] The Museum asserted in its written submissions that the advancement of the inquiry into this complaint would somehow be delayed. I am not quite sure how that would be the case. Will the Museum need more time to prepare its case? Hearing and disclosure dates have yet to be set so it is likely that we are still many months away from the opening of the inquiry. The Museum should therefore have adequate time to prepare itself. Moreover, it was made quite evident by Commission and Union counsel that at the outset, their evidence will consist of establishing the existence of an inherent gender bias in the current job evaluation plan. The Commission even suggested bifurcating the case so as to deal with this issue in its entirety before advancing to the secondary question of determining the existence of any wage gap. Whether or not the bifurcation will occur, it is nonetheless evident that the issues arising from the application of the Guidelines are not likely to come before the Tribunal for quite some time. If the Museum needs additional time to organize its case, it is certainly free to request some reasonable accommodation from the Tribunal in terms of scheduling. In any case, I fail to see how the Museum is prejudiced.\n[24] The Museum argued that it was also prejudiced in having been denied access to the Commission's investigation and conciliation processes with respect to what it views as the new allegations regarding s. 11. However, as I have stated earlier, these are not new allegations, just particulars concerning the existing complaint. This submission need not therefore be addressed.\n[25] For all these reasons, the Museum's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by Athanasios D.

Her position is that they failed to provide her with half time work. Then there is a financial issue. And a question of dignity. She says that the band did not have the necessary process in place for bringing her back into the workforce. She says that she wasn't treated with compassion.\n[4] There are difficulties on the financial side, since the Complainant accepted disability payments, which were awarded on the basis that she was totally disabled. As I understand her testimony, however, she says that she only accepted these payments after she gave up on the idea of coming back to work on a graduated, part-time basis.\n[5] The second complaint alleges retaliation. Both sides agree that their relationship got progressively worse. Ms. Schuyler attributes this to the human rights complaint. She says that she had seen this kind of thing before. She says that the band did not like being sued.\n[6] At this point, I only have Ms. Schuyler's testimony. Any evidence of retaliation is a matter of inference. From her perspective, however, it is a simple situation. When she refused to withdraw the complaint, she was ostracized. There may have been other factors, but that was the crux of it. The situation deteriorated and she was eventually dismissed.\n[7] Ms. Schuyler's view of the situation may or may not be the right one. It is very difficult for me to say, without hearing from the Respondent. The band has already taken the position that the problems were on Ms. Schuyler's side, in the performance of her duties. I have an obligation, however, to suspend my judgement until the case closes. This is not the time, however, to choose between the two sides.\n[8] Under the Canadian Human Rights Act, retaliation is a form of discrimination. The evidence of discrimination is often indirect. Respondents rarely admit openly that they have discriminated against a Complainant. I think that Ms. Schuyler's conclusions are entitled to some consideration. She knew the band and council and cannot be expected to provide direct evidence of the employer's motivations.\n[9] The only question on a non-suit is whether there is some kind of case before me, which calls for a response from the Respondent. I think there is.\n[10] I am not saying that there is a strong case. There may be difficulties with the evidence. But this is not the time to deal with those kinds of issues. The only question is whether there is a case to meet.\n[11] In the circumstances, the motion is dismissed. There is a prima facie case. It is for the Respondent to decide whether to call evidence.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario May 6, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILES:\nT980\/10004 and T1014\/13404\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nKaren Schuyler v.

Additional remedies.\nIV. Order\nI. Introduction [1] The Respondent has made a motion to stay or dismiss the complaint on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata. The Notice of Motion states that the case has already been heard under Part III of the Canada Labour Code, RSC 1985, c. L-2. It follows that the question before the Tribunal has already been decided.\n[2] The facts behind the complaint are relatively simple. Ms. Toth was hired in 2000. She subsequently went through a process of in vitro fertilization and became pregnant. She alleges that Mr. Aylward, the President of the company, resented the fact that she took sick leave and maternity leave as a result.\n[3] Ms. Toth filed a human rights complaint in 2002, alleging that she had been discriminated against under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6. Her position was terminated the following year. The human rights complaint was later amended to include the termination.\n[4] This is only half the story. As it turns out, Ms. Toth also filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code, alleging that she had been unjustly dismissed. There was a hearing in April 2004. The adjudicator found that Ms. Toth had been unjustly dismissed and ordered the Respondent to pay her salary in lieu of notice.\n[5] The motion before me proceeded by means of a voir dire. There was an affidavit from both sides: one from Mr. Salveta, a human resources adviser who represented the Respondent at the labour hearing, and one from the Complainant. There was cross-examination on the affidavits. Ms. Toth agreed that Mr. Aylward\u2019s attitude towards her pregnancy was central in the labour hearing.\n[6] Mr. Taylor appeared for the Respondent. He submitted that the issues in the present proceeding are identical to the issues that were before the adjudicator under the Canada Labour Code. As he sees it, the essential question in the labour hearing was whether Ms. Toth was discriminated against because she underwent a process of in vitro fertilization and became pregnant. This is the question before the Tribunal.\n[7] Mr. Verbanac appeared for the Complainant. He submitted that the hearing under the Canada Labour Code addressed financial and employment matters. It did not deal with the issues under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This seems unconvincing. Mr. Taylor referred me to the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, which states that the Complainant\u2019s argument before the Tribunal will follow a similar format to the argument presented to the adjudicator.\n[8] The Respondent acknowledges that there may be situations where proceedings with respect to the loss of employment under the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act might be distinguished. In the present case, however, it submits that the Complainant has already won her case. It would be wrong to let her now turn to the Tribunal and shop for additional remedies.\nII. The Doctrine of Res Judicata A. Does the case meet the criteria in Danyluk? [9] The doctrine of res judicata holds that judicial decisions, at least, are final. They stand against the world. The doctrine has been extended into the administrative realm and is now of general application. The specific branch of the doctrine that appears to apply in the present circumstances is commonly called cause of action estoppel. The argument is essentially that the case has been heard. It cannot be heard again.\n[10] Mr. Taylor and Mr. Verbanac agreed that three conditions must be established, to bring the doctrine of res judicata into operation. These conditions are set out in Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc. [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at 477. They are as follows:\nthe party relying on the doctrine must establish that the prior decision was final; it must establish that the parties were the same; and 3) it must establish that the decision dealt with the same question.\n(i) The decision was final [11] The Complainant accepts that the decision of the adjudicator in the present case was final. The Respondent is not satisfied with this, however, and relies on section 243 of the Canada Labour Code. That section reads as follows:\n243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.\n(2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under section 242.\nThe Respondent submits that I cannot revisit the issues considered by the adjudicator without offending the intentions of this provision.\n(ii) The parties are the same [12] Counsel for the Complainant submits that the Human Rights Commission was not a party to the hearing under the Canada Labour Code. It follows that the parties to the two hearings are not the same.\n[13] Mr. Vebanac relies on the ruling of this Tribunal in Parisien v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, CHRT T699\/0402 (15 July 2002), where the Complainant had filed an unsuccessful grievance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission, which appeared at the human rights inquiry, had not participated in the grievance process. The Tribunal held that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply.\n[14] The Tribunal in Parisien recognized that the human rights process engages fundamental rights, which go beyond the private rights of the parties. This may have a bearing on other cases. I am dealing with a different set of circumstances, however. The Human Rights Commission, which represents the public interest, did not appear at the hearing in the present case.\n[15] There is a complication. Although the Commission has advised the Tribunal that it has nothing to say on the motion, it continues to take the position that it remains a party to the inquiry. I think the way out of this difficulty is to recognize that legal terms have a certain flexibility. The Commission may be a party to the present inquiry for some purposes and not for others. I am satisfied, however, that it is not a party for the purpose of determining whether the doctrine of res judicata applies.\n[16] This is ultimately a matter of fairness. The purpose of determining whether the Commission is a party in the context of the immediate motion is largely to determine whether it has been deprived of an opportunity to address the issues in the case. I cannot see how anyone can make such an assertion in the present circumstances. It follows that the parties before me, for the purposes of res judicata, are the same parties that appeared before the adjudicator in the labour hearing.\n(iii) The question is the same [17] The more difficult issue is whether the question before the Tribunal is the same as the question that was before the adjudicator. Mr. Verbanac submitted that the question before the adjudicator was whether the termination of the Complainant\u2019s position could be justified on business and employment grounds. The Respondent says that this merely reflects the process under the Canada Labour Code, which puts the onus on the employer to justify the termination. This forces the employer to go first.\n[18] The adjudicator sets out the position taken by the two sides in the labour hearing in the first paragraph of his award. The employer, he writes, states that Ms. Toth was terminated for legitimate business reasons due to a downturn in profits, and that her former duties were redistributed among the remaining employees. The Complainant replied that the reason for her termination was that the employer objected to her taking sick leave, and then maternity leave, after going through a process of in vitro fertilization.\n[19] It is apparent from the adjudicator\u2019s decision that the Complainant\u2019s case proceeded on the basis that the Respondent\u2019s attitude towards her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. The Complainant alleged that the business reasons put forward by the Respondent were nothing more than a pretext, which was advanced to justify the termination. This is a common form of argument in the caselaw of human rights.\n[20] There is no transcript of the labour hearing. Ms. Toth nevertheless told the adjudicator that Mr. Aylward\u2019s behaviour deteriorated after he discovered that she was undergoing in vitro fertilization. She agreed on the witness stand that the case she presented to the adjudicator was all about her pregnancy and maternity leave. As Mr. Salveta put it, the core of her position was that Mr. Aylward terminated her position because she became pregnant.\n[21] I cannot see any way around it. The legal question before the Tribunal is whether Ms. Toth was discriminated against. The legal question before the adjudicator was whether she was unjustly dismissed. These two questions collapse into each other. The adjudicator\u2019s decision was premised on the finding that Mr. Aylward\u2019s attitude to the pregnancy entered into his decision to let her go. I think this constitutes a finding of discrimination.\n[22] If Ms. Toth was unjustly dismissed, it was because she was discriminated against. It follows that the same question was at least implicitly before the adjudicator. A ruling in favour of the Respondent on the human rights complaint would contradict the ruling of the adjudicator. It would not be possible to find that the Complainant\u2019s position was properly terminated without offending the privative clause in section 243 of the Canada Labour Code.\n[23] The situation might be different if there was a distinct allegation of harassment, which could be severed from the termination. The underlying factual issues in the two hearings are the same, however. The adjudicator had to consider the Respondent\u2019s entire course of conduct, in reaching his conclusions. Any other allegations are an integral part of the course of conduct that culminated in the termination. It is all part of the same fabric.\n[24] The Respondent has argued that the present case is governed by the principle set out by Justice Abella, in Rasanen v. Rosemount Instruments Limited [1994] O.J. No. 200 (Ont. C.A.). The plaintiff in Rasanen had sought termination pay under the Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 137. He also sued for wrongful dismissal. There was a hearing by a referee under the Employment Standards Act, before the action came to trial.\n[25] Justice Abella agreed with the trial judge, who held that res judicata applied. At p. 278, she writes that the question in the two proceedings should not be narrowly construed.\nIn my view, the question to be decided in these proceedings is the same question that was, and was necessarily, decided in the earlier Employment Standards Act proceedings: was there an entitlement by the employee to compensation from the employer arising from the termination of his employment? There is no doubt that under the Employment Standards Act this question has a different linguistic and quantitative formulation than at common law. But a different characterization and process does not, in this case, mean a different question.\nI am aware that the reaction to Rasanen has been somewhat mixed. I nevertheless think that the same reasoning applies to the present case.\n[26] There is a healthy measure of common sense in the analysis provided by Justice Abella. The fact that there were differences in the two processes was not decisive. The parties in Rasanen had the opportunity to call witnesses, present their cases, and respond to the position on the other side. The substance of the allegations was the same. This was sufficient to bring res judicata into operation.\n[27] I think there is probably a public interest exception, which might apply in a case that raises issues that go beyond the private interests of the parties. The Tribunal has implicitly recognized this, in declining to apply the doctrine when the Human Rights Commission chooses to appear. The present case does not raise these kinds of issues, however, and bears the features of private litigation.\n[28] The principle in Rasanen is that a case should only be heard once. It is sometimes said that a party cannot litigate in installments. If a hearing or trial is deficient, that can be dealt with by review or appeal. But that is the end of it. It would be wrong to let a Complainant start again, merely by moving a case to another statutory regime.\n[29] The Complainant has cited cases where adjudicators have refused to hear allegations of discrimination or harassment, on the basis that the Complainant has a source of redress under the Canadian Human Rights Act. I think this presents a different kind of situation. If it is apparent at the outset of a hearing that a complaint is more properly made under different legislation, it makes sense for an adjudicator to decline the case. Here, the Complainant made the allegation of discrimination in the course of a hearing that was properly before the adjudicator.\nIII. Additional remedies [30] This does not dispense entirely with the motion. The decision in Danyluk holds that there is a discretionary element in the doctrine of res judicata. Even if the technical requirements of the law have been met, Mr. Verbanac submits that the Complainant should be allowed to seek additional remedies under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[31] The first remedy that the Complainant is seeking is payment of the discretionary bonus. This is an issue that arises naturally out of the termination of Ms. Toth\u2019s employment. It was dealt with explicitly by the adjudicator. I do not see how I can reconsider this issue without reviewing the substance of his decision, which is protected by section 243 of the Canada Labour Code.\n[32] Then there is pain and suffering. Mr. Verbanac says that his client is not entitled to compensation for pain and suffering under the Canada Labour Code. Mr. Taylor disagrees. He has referred me to s. 242(4) of the Canada Labour Code, which gives an adjudicator the authority to do anything that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequences of the dismissal. This language is very broad.\n[33] Mr. Taylor has also given me a number of cases. In Greyeyes v. Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation, [2003] C.L.A.D. No. 205, for example, at para. 45, an adjudicator stated that the purpose of an award under the relevant provisions of the Canada Labour Code is to make the complainant whole. This includes compensation, at para. 51, for any psychological harm suffered as a consequence of being unlawfully dismissed. In Papequash v. Key Indian Band, [2003] C.L.A.D. No. 142, at para. 226, an adjudicator made an award for mental distress.\n[34] The Complainant submits that these cases are exceptional. Even if an adjudicator has the power to award damages for mental distress, it is an extraordinary form of relief, which is rarely sought or given. An adjudicator does not have the explicit jurisdiction enjoyed by the Tribunal in this area.\n[35] The Complainant has also asked for a remedy under s. 53(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which gives the Tribunal the power to compensate a Complainant for wilful and reckless conduct. This is apparently unavailable under the Canada Labour Code. I was nevertheless given caselaw in support of the proposition that aggravated damages are available under section 242 of the Canada Labour Code. These kinds of damages were described by Lord Devlin in Rookes v. Barnard, [1964] A.C. 1129, [1964] 2 W.L.R. 269, [1964] 1 All E.R. 367 (H.L.), at 1121. I think that they provide a similar form of relief.\n[36] There is a substantial overlap in the remedies that were available under the Canada Labour Code and the remedies that she is seeking under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The adjudicator could have compensated the Complainant for emotional distress, if only by extending the period of salary in lieu of notice. In the circumstances, I am not convinced that a complainant is entitled to seek additional remedies in a second hearing, under a different statute. The additional relief that might be available under the Canadian Human Rights Act is not sufficient to justify a second hearing.\n[37] The present ruling naturally applies to the facts of the present case. I have already suggested that there is an exception, in cases which call for a public interest remedy that is not available under the Canada Labour Code. The remedies sought by the Complainant under the Canadian Human Rights Act are personal and compensatory, however. They do not engage the larger public interest or take the case out of the realm of private litigation.\n[38] There are other considerations. It is significant, for example, that the Respondent is not entitled to costs under the Canadian Human Rights Act. I think it would be unfair to force it to go through a second hearing, at its own cost, when the matter has already been decided in another forum.\n[39] I cannot see any reason not to apply the doctrine of res judicata in the present case. The fact that there are differences, even substantial differences, in the remedies available in different forums, is not sufficient to justify a second hearing. Justice Abella recognized in Rasanen that broader remedies were available in the lawsuit. It did not matter. A party is only entitled to one adjudication.\n[40] It is evident that Ms. Toth has other sources of redress. She could, for example, have filed a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal. It seems clear that she would be barred from doing so. I think she must also be barred here. It is asking too much of me, to find that the Tribunal can somehow deal with the termination, in spite of the fact that a court cannot do so. The cases cited by the Complainant are distinguishable on the facts.\nIV. Order [41] The motion asks me to stay or dismiss the complaint. I am not sure what a stay would consist of in the present circumstances. The Tribunal is a statutory Tribunal, moreover, with limited powers. In addition, there is evidence before me, which goes at least implicitly to the merits of the case. Finally, there is the fact that the doctrine of res judicata is based on the need for finality in the legal process. In the circumstances, I think the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the complaint.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario May 18, 2005\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T986\/10604\nStyle of Cause: Paulette Toth v.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Tribunal is called upon to decide if Bell Canada discriminated against the complainant, Mr. Roger Virk, in the course of his employment at Bell on the ground of national or ethic origin, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Tribunal is also asked to decide if the complainant was the object of retaliation on the part of Bell Canada, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act.\n[2] Mr. Virk alleges that Bell Canada, in general, and Mr. Ted Weich, in particular, discriminated against him in January 2002 by not confirming him as manager on the Globe and Mail project because he is of South Asian descent and that Mr. Penno Makdessian retaliated against him, at the end of 2003, by terminating his employment because he had filed a human rights complaint.\n[3] At the hearing, the complainant was not represented by counsel. The respondent was. The Commission did not appear. Three witnesses were heard: the complainant, Mr. Virk, as well as Mr. Ted Weich and Mr. Penno Makdessian, for the Respondent.\n[4] Mr. Weich testified that he was made aware of Mr. Virk's human rights complaint by Ms. Incognito, Bell's Industrial Relations Director, on May 9, 2002. As for Mr. Makdessian, he testified that he learned about the complaint in January 2003.\nII. BACKGROUND A. Mr. Virk's employment history at Bell prior to the Globe and Mail project [5] Mr. Virk started working at Bell Canada on October 12, 1993 as a Direct Marketing Sales Associate. Before joining Bell, Mr. Virk worked as a district supervisor for an electronics retail store chain.\n[6] On July 7, 1995, Mr. Virk advanced to a support associate function. Subsequently, he was promoted to the position of a support supervisor (Senior Associate 8). As of January 9, 1998, this designation was changed to that of Resource Associate.\n[7] In December 1998, Mr. Ted Weich became Associate Director for the Vendor Management Team that is part of the Direct Marketing Centre (DMC). At the time, Mr. Virk was a Resource Associate with the Vendor Management Team. The Vendor Management Team was composed of Mr. Weich, three Sales Managers and five Resource Associates who reported to the Sales Managers. Resource Associates are unionized employees. Sales Managers are management employees.\n[8] The record shows that Mr. Virk was at the time and until he left Bell Canada covered by the CTEA Clerical collective agreement as opposed to the CTEA Sales collective agreement. The record also shows that in the Direct Marketing Centre, there are two types of unionized employees that can be promoted, clerical employees, under the Clerical Collective Agreement, and sales employees, under the Sales Collective Agreement.\n[9] According to the evidence, clerical employees, such as Resource Associates and Associates are mainly support functions. Sales employees, such as Direct Marketing Associates, are telemarketers. Mr. Virk testified that all Resource Associates are former Direct Marketing Associates and that he had been in the past a Direct Marketing Associate.\n[10] On May 2, 2000, a canvass for a DMC Strategic Partnering Manager CP-2 was posted. Mr. Virk applied for the position. In an e-mail sent to Mr. Weich a few days before sending in his application, Mr. Virk raised his concern about a possible perception on Mr. Weich's part that he might not have the required sales background and skills for the management position. In his e-mail, Mr. Virk highlighted his past sales and management experience at Bell as well as prior to joining Bell.\n[11] Mr. John Chung, a confirmed Sales Manager in the Direct Marketing Centre, was selected for the job. According to Mr. Weich, better candidates than Mr. Virk applied for the job.\n[12] The evidence shows that in the course of his employment at Bell, Mr. Virk held a few acting assignments. What constitutes an acting assignment is specified in Exhibit R-1.\n[13] An acting assignment is when an employee assumes the responsibilities of a higher position requiring greater professional responsibility and competence. A typical example of this is when an employee replaces another employee (on a higher position) who is on maternity\/ parental leave. If the assignment is not of a temporary nature, the employee should be promoted to the position. According to Exhibit R-1, acting assignments are used when the assignment is for more than three weeks.\n[14] Asked to explain the purpose of acting assignments in the case of unionized employees, Mr. Weich stated that the purpose is to fulfill a need of the required business unit, that in most cases those given an acting position are individuals identified as having the potential to move in their career development. Mr. Weich testified that the people asked to fill an acting position will normally be selected by the person in charge of a particular business unit depending on the needs of that particular unit.\n[15] According to Mr. Weich, an acting assignment will vary in time depending on the needs of the business unit. In his testimony, Mr. Virk acknowledged that acting assignments are quite frequent in the Direct Marketing Centre, that they can be from anywhere between a few days to a few months and that they provide unionized employees with an opportunity to get experience in a management role.\n[16] For his part, Mr. Makdessian testified that acting assignments can last up to 14 months, that people are put into acting positions based on the business need of that moment and that in the event the business needs change, the employee goes back to his substantive position. According to Mr. Makdessian, it is very common for employees holding an acting assignment to revert to their substantive position at the end of the assignment.\n[17] Asked how frequent it is for employees to revert to their substantive position after an acting assignment versus being confirmed right away as a manager, Mr. Weich stated that there is no formal policy that exists at Bell, that it all depends on the needs of a particular business unit. Furthermore, Mr. Weich stated that he knew of no policy existing at Bell to confirm acting managers after a specific period of time. He acknowledged, however, in his testimony that an acting manager is a potential confirmed manager.\n[18] For his part, Mr. Virk acknowledged that once an acting assignment is over, it is not unusual in usual circumstances for the unionized employee to revert to his former position. However, Mr. Virk holds the view that, in his case, it was rather odd, extremely odd.\n[19] The evidence shows that, in July 2001, Mr. Virk got an acting assignment as a Sales Manager in the Consumer section of the Direct Marketing Centre and another one in September 2001. This last acting assignment did not entail the supervision of any staff. According to Mr. Virk, this position involved working with an improvement process with the reporting section that looked after the reports and the revenue capturing of the entire Direct Marketing Centre.\nB. Mr. Virk's employment history in relation to the Globe and Mail project [20] The evidence shows that in July 2001, the Globe and Mail approached Bell to set up a call centre to solicit potential Globe and Mail subscribers. A first meeting was held in August 2001 with the Globe and Mail people. The decision was made to set up the call centre within the Vendor Management Group in the Direct Marketing Centre because of its expertise in that area. Mr. Ted Weich took charge of the project.\n[21] Under the terms of the agreement reached with the Globe and Mail, the latter would provide Bell Canada with calling lists of approximately 135 000 to 150 000 phone numbers per month. Bell Canada was to be paid on a per contact basis. Initially, the Globe and Mail project was considered a pilot project that was to last two months.\n[22] The months of September and October 2001 were spent on setting up the project, which started in November 2001. The evidence shows that Mr. Weich was instrumental in creating the infrastructure for the Globe and Mail project. In his testimony, Mr. Virk acknowledged that Mr. Weich was involved in launching the Globe and Mail project, that he was in fact the one who put it together.\n[23] According to Mr. Weich, temporary employees and not permanent employees were hired for the project because of the restructuring that was going on at that time at Bell Canada. The number of employees hired ranged from twelve to fourteen.\n[24] In October 2001, Mr. Virk was offered by Mr. Weich, his supervisor, an acting management position on the Globe and Mail project. There was no posting for the position. Mr. Virk accepted the offer and became the acting manager on the project effective October 22, 2001. The evidence shows that Mr. Virk was to report to Mr. Weich.\n[25] Asked to explain why he decided to choose an acting manager for the project rather than a confirmed manager, Mr. Weich stated that because it was a trial, he thought that an acting manager would be best. Asked to explain why he chose Mr. Virk, Mr. Weich stated that it was because he wanted to provide Mr. Virk with an opportunity to develop his skills given the fact that Mr. Virk had expressed in the past his desire to have management opportunities for his own development and growth.\n[26] Asked how much time he spent on the Globe and Mail project during the months of September, October, November and December 2001, Mr. Weich testified that the Globe and Mail project consumed about 80 percent of his time during the first two months and probably between 60 and 65 percent of his time in the months of November and December 2001.\n[27] In his testimony, Mr. Weich acknowledged that Mr. Virk played a role in the setting up of the Globe and Mail project, notably in setting up some of the workstations, in making sure the configuration was working and in participating in conference calls.\n[28] According to Mr. Weich, Mr. Virk's role on the Globe and Mail project was to maintain the activities on the floor, participate in group meetings and prepare reports. Mr. Virk listed as part of his functions managing potential subscribers' lists, liaising with other groups, setting up the computers. Mr. Weich acknowledged in his testimony that on the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Virk assumed more responsibilities than a Sales Manager in the Direct Marketing Centre would ordinarily have.\n[29] The evidence shows that Mr. Virk saw himself, and not Mr. Weich, as the project manager. In his testimony, Mr. Weich strongly disputed the allegation made by Mr. Virk that he, not Mr. Weich, was the project manager. Mr. Virk did however acknowledge in his testimony that Mr. Weich was the architect of the project.\n[30] On this point, the evidence clearly shows that, during the months of November and December 2001, Mr. Virk was at all times the acting Sales Manager on the Globe and Mail project, that Mr. Weich remained the project manager and that it was under his supervision and direction that Mr. Virk worked.\n[31] On November 30, 2001, Mr. Virk was informed by Mr. Weich that a reorganization was being implemented in his group (Vendor Management) effective January 1, 2002 and that starting January 2, 2002, the project would fall under Mr. Charlie Latino's group (Consumer Sales). The evidence shows that on that day, Mr. Weich told Mr. Virk that, as of January 1, 2002, he would remain on the Globe and Mail project but would revert to his status of Resource Associate, replacing Mr. Simon Shim as Resource Associate on the project.\n[32] Asked to explain the reason of this transfer, Mr. Weich stated that given the content of the project and what was involved, it had been decided that it fitted better under Mr. Latino's group.\n[33] In his testimony, Mr. Virk stated that Mr. Weich told him that the decision to revert him back to his Resource Associate position was in no way related to his performance. According to Mr. Weich, Mr. Virk never expressed at the time the desire to leave the Globe and Mail project once he had been told that he would be going back to his Resource Associate status or to be assigned to another position in the Vendor Management Group.\n[34] The evidence shows that Mr. Weich also informed Mr. Virk that a confirmed manager from the Consumer Group would become the manager of the Globe and Mail project as of January 1, 2002, that person being Mr. Penno Makdessian. Mr. Virk was to stay on the project to provide assistance to Mr. Makdessian.\n[35] According to Mr. Weich, given the fact that Mr. Latino would be taking over the project as of January 1, 2002, the decision to choose Mr. Makdessian was that of Mr. Latino and not his even though the decision was made in November 2001. Mr. Weich testified that his opinion was sought by Mr. Latino.\n[36] Asked to explain why Mr. Virk was sent back to his Resource Associate position effective January 1, 2002, Mr. Weich offered the following explanation: since the project was going under Mr. Latino's organization and since the company was rightsizing its operations in the Direct Marketing Centre and some Sales Managers stood to lose their jobs while employees like Mr. Virk were not confronted with that prospect since they were going back to their previously held position, the decision was made to bring a confirmed Sales Manager from the consumer floor to manage the project. According to Mr. Weich, this was a sound business decision and had nothing to do with Mr. Virk's performance on the Globe and Mail project.\n[37] According to the evidence, rightsizing entails the elimination of certain positions within an organization or a department, positions that the organization or the department can do without.\n[38] In his testimony, Mr. Weich stated that even though an organization is rightsizing, it will still fill jobs that it considers a crucial part of the operations of the organization. Thus, it is not unusual for an organization to canvass a specific job in those circumstances to replace the departing incumbent. Mr. Virk acknowledged in his testimony that it was normal for an organization to fill a key position, a position that the company cannot do without, when an incumbent leaves this position vacant even if the company is in a rightsizing mode.\n[39] The evidence shows that, in December 2001, a canvass for a Sales Manager in the Business Unit in the Direct Marketing Centre was posted when the confirmed Sales Manager who held that position left.\n[40] Asked to explain why the Direct Marketing Centre was hiring while the company was rightsizing, Mr. Weich stated that this Sales Manager position was a crucial part of the operations of the Business Unit and had to be filled by a confirmed Sales Manager because of the high level of expertise required. The person chosen was a confirmed Sales Manager from the Consumer Direct Marketing Centre.\n[41] Finally, at the November 30, 2001 meeting, Mr. Weich told Mr. Virk that because of the right sizing that was taking place in the company, there would be no more acting manager assignments as of November 2001.\n[42] Asked to explain that decision, Mr. Weich stated in his testimony that at the time, the priority was given to securing the jobs of confirmed Sales Managers who faced the possibility of losing their jobs in a rightsizing environment before giving out acting assignments. Time and again, Mr. Weich stated that when a confirmed manager stands to lose his job, the company will try to protect that person's job. Thus, it will terminate an acting manager's assignment, however good his performance is, so as to secure a confirmed manager's job knowing that the acting manager will go back to his previous unionized job.\n[43] Mr. Virk testified that, at first, he believed the explanation provided to him by Mr. Weich as to why he was being replaced as acting manager on the Globe and Mail project. His feelings changed, according to his testimony, when he saw in mid-December that two unionized employees had been given acting manager assignments as of January 2, 2002, Ms. Debbie Vieira and Mr. Ernesto Imbrogno. Both were Direct Marketing Associates in the Consumer group of the Direct Marketing Centre. Both were appointed acting Consumer Sales Manager.\n[44] It is suggested by the evidence that Ms. Vieira got eight acting assignments in 2002 and that after each assignment, she reverted to her previously held position. In January 2003, she got a new acting management assignment and was eventually confirmed as manager. In his testimony, Mr. Virk acknowledged that it is logical for a person who has been on acting assignment to get confirmed in the position if the position becomes available for a promotion.\n[45] As for Mr. Imbrogno, the evidence shows that at the end of the acting assignment referred to above, he reverted to his Direct Marketing Associate position.\n[46] Asked to explain why Ms. Debbie Vieira and Mr. Ernesto Imbrogno, both Caucasian, were given acting assignments effective January 2, 2002, Mr. Weich stated that these occurred in the Consumer Division under Mr. Latino and that he was not aware of the reasons why these two acting assignments were given out. He, however, stated that, on November 30, 2001, when he met with Mr. Virk, the information he had at the time was that there would be no opportunities for acting managers.\n[47] On December 6, 2001, Mr. Virk sent Mr. Weich a memo in which he expressed his disappointment in reverting to the position of a Resource Associate on the same project he had assisted in launching and managing from its inception. He stated in his e-mail that he would continue his ongoing support and assistance to the project but that given the circumstances, he would explore other opportunities within Bell in 2002.\n[48] In his response to Mr. Virk's e-mail, Mr. Weich offered the latter his assistance to find another Resource Associate job within Bell. The evidence shows that Mr. Virk never asked for Mr. Weich's assistance.\n[49] At the hearing, Mr. Virk alluded to the fact that, at the time, he had asked Mr. Weich to be moved back to the Vendor Management Team as a Resource Associate so as to have another person from the Vendor Management Team take over the Resource Associate position on the Globe and Mail project. According to Mr. Virk, this would have saved him from a lot of anguish. Mr. Weich testified that Mr. Virk never expressed this desire.\n[50] The evidence shows that the Globe and Mail project, as of January 1, 2002, was transferred from the Vendor Management Group to the Consumer Sales Group within the Direct Marketing Centre. The evidence also shows that Mr. Weich officially stopped being responsible for the Globe and Mail project as of January 1, 2002.\n[51] As for Mr. Virk, on January 2, 2002, he resumed working on the Globe and Mail project, this time as a Resource Associate and not as acting manager. The evidence shows that Mr. Virk reported to Mr. Makdessian who in turn reported to Mr. Latino. Mr. Virk replaced Mr. Simon Shim who had been working on the Globe and Mail project as Resource Associate. Mr. Shim, according to Mr. Virk, was reassigned somewhere else.\n[52] Asked what his involvement was with the Globe and Mail project after January 2, 2002, Mr. Weich stated in his testimony that he still provided advice to those in charge of the project for about three months given his knowledge and expertise. However, during that period, he had no involvement in the day-to-day activities that were handled by Mr. Makdessian and had no authority on the hiring process.\n[53] In his testimony, Mr. Virk expressed the view that he did not think that Mr. Makdessian could do the job as well as he did. Mr. Virk alluded to the fact that when Mr. Makdessian took charge of the Globe and Mail project, he had no previous experience on the project. This fact was acknowledged by Mr. Makdessian who stated in his testimony that when he took charge of the project, he was not familiar with all of its aspects but learned as he went along.\n[54] Asked to explain the context in which he joined the project, Mr. Makdessian indicated that in late November or early December 2001, he was informed by his Associate Director, Mr. Charlie Latino, that the strategy of the Consumer Sales Group in the Direct Marketing Centre for 2002 would change, that they would be doing less work and that this meant that there would be a reduction of the number of managers. According to Mr. Makdessian, Mr. Latino informed him of the rightsizing exercise that the company would be doing and that he would secure a position for him as a confirmed manager.\n[55] Asked what happened to his former Sales Manager position in the Consumer Sales Group after he took over the Globe and Mail position, Mr. Makdessian stated that his former team was dismantled, that the employees on that team were distributed to the remaining Sales Managers on the sales floor and that in fact his position was eliminated.\n[56] In his testimony, Mr. Makdessian stated that when he took over the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Virk was a little bit disappointed at first and that he shared this disappointment with him. According to Mr. Makdessian, Mr. Virk assured him that he was going to give one hundred percent while he was there and would not let him down. Mr. Virk also informed Mr. Makdessian that he would probably be pursuing other opportunities within the Bell environment. Mr. Makdessian stated in his testimony that he offered to help Mr. Virk but that the latter never asked for his help.\n[57] Asked to comment on how he advanced the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Makdessian testified that one of his achievements was to design and implement an Incentive and Recognition Program. He also stated that he brought with him a wealth of sales expertise that helped him coach his team.\n[58] The evidence shows that Mr. Makdessian managed the Globe and Mail project from January 2, 2002 to April 25, 2002. According to Mr. Virk, during that period, the sales objectives were not met for every month.\n[59] In April 2002,Mr. Makdessian became an Acting Senior Team Leader in the Consumer Sales Group in Mr. Charlie Latino's organization. This left the Sales Manager position on the Globe and Mail project vacant.\n[60] In his new role as Senior Team Leader, Mr. Makdessian had responsibility for the Globe and Mail project as well as other projects. In his testimony, Mr. Makdessian acknowledged that as Senior Team Leader, he was less involved in the day-to-day management of the Globe and Mail project. He further acknowledged that when he stopped managing the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Virk was left to himself to manage the project.\n[61] On April 25, 2002, an e-mail was sent out announcing that Mr. Virk would be acting Sales Manager on the Globe and Mail project as of April 23, 2002. The e-mail indicates that the assignment was scheduled to end on June 30, 2002. The evidence shows however that, at the end of June 2002, Mr. Virk's assignment was extended to October 3, 2002. The record shows that on April 25, 2002, Mr. Weich sent an e-mail to Mr. Virk congratulating him on his new acting assignment.\n[62] Mr. Makdessian testified that it was Mr. Latino who made the decision to give the Sales Manager assignment to Mr. Virk. Mr. Makdessian stated in his testimony that he supported Mr. Latino's decision having worked with Mr. Virk since January.\n[63] According to Mr. Makdessian, Mr. Virk was not given the Sales Manager position at the time but rather an acting assignment because he wanted to have the opportunity to observe Mr. Virk on a day-to-day basis, notably the leadership qualities he would be looking for in a Sales Manager.\n[64] The evidence shows that in September 2002, Mr. Makdessian was confirmed in this role of Senior Team Leader that he held until September 2003 when he took on the role of Associate Director in the Sales Department for the Consumer Direct Marketing Centre in an acting capacity.\n[65] For the period running from April 23, 2002 to October 3, 2002, Mr. Virk, as Acting Manager and Ms. Madeline Young, an Associate, were the only two people involved on a day-to-day basis on the Globe and Mail project. Mr. Virk testified that, during that period, he met all of his sales and contact objectives. This was confirmed by Mr. Makdessian in his testimony.\n[66] At the end of the period, Mr. Virk reverted to his usual Resource Associate position and Mr. Ron Singh, a Confirmed Manager, who is of South Asian descent, was appointed to the Sales Manager position on the Globe and Mail project, a position which he held until October 2003 when the Globe and Mail project folded. Mr. Virk acknowledged in his testimony that Mr. Singh was like himself of South Asian descent. According to Mr. Virk, Mr. Singh was able to do the job properly.\n[67] Asked why Mr. Singh, a confirmed manager, was preferred to Mr. Virk to manage the Globe and Mail project in October 2002, Mr. Makdessian explained that as the Globe and Mail project was evolving, the Globe partners were asking his group to have more aggressive sales targets; more complicated campaigns were on the horizon which required a lot of attention and detail.\n[68] Mr. Makdessian stated in his testimony that in order to meet these needs, he preferred to go ahead with Mr. Ron Singh rather than Mr. Virk, being of the view that Mr. Singh was better suited than Mr. Virk to do the job because he had a strong sales background. According to Mr. Makdessian, it was Mr. Latino who made the decision after having solicited his advice.\n[69] The evidence shows that, in August 2003, Mr. Virk got a new acting assignment on the Globe and Mail project, replacing Mr. Ron Singh as acting manager while the latter was on vacation. This assignment lasted until the end of October 2003.\n[70] In October 2003, Mr. Makdessian's group received notification from the Globe partners that they were going to be dramatically reducing the call volumes, by 50 percent in the month of November and 75 percent in the month of December.\n[71] Considering the Globe and Mail's notification, Bell Canada reviewed the overall profitability of the relationship with its Globe partners and concluded that from a financial perspective, it did not make business sense to continue positioning the Globe and Mail, unless the Globe could guarantee a higher call volume and agree to set new prices per contact. As the Globe and Mail was not prepared to change the terms of the agreement, the decision was made to shut down the Globe and Mail project permanently.\n[72] The evidence shows that the project shut down on October 31, 2003. Mr. Makdessian testified that the Globe and Mail people were shocked by the decision and asked if they could come back with a counter-offer.\n[73] Asked to explain the announcement that went out on November 4, 2003 to the effect that the project would be shutting down for the remainder of 2003 rather than permanently, Mr. Makdessian stated that, given that the Globe and Mail people had said that they would come back with a counter-offer, Bell wanted to position itself in case the Globe and Mail did in fact come back with a counter-offer. Bell did not think at the time that the project would resume but was ready to leave the door open.\n[74] On November 5, 2003, Mr. Penno Makdessian held a meeting with a number of Direct Marketing Centre employees to announce that, given the reorganization that was taking place at Bell, there would be some positions, in fact seven, that would be declared surplus.\n[75] In attendance at the meeting, according to Mr. Makdessian, were three of the four First Call resolution employees, Mr. Virk, Ms. Young, Ms. Karen Anderson, as well as Ms. Anna Paolella from the Direct Marketing Centre and Ms. Sonia Bell, a union representative from the CTEA Sales bargaining unit. In his testimony, Mr. Virk was not able to recall precisely who was in attendance.\n[76] The evidence shows that the people in attendance were told that the First Call Resolution function was going to be terminated as well as the Globe and Mail project. They were also told that the E-Contact position, which was a temporary position, held by Ms. Karen Anderson, was being declared surplus, its future being however uncertain. Contrary to the First Call Resolution and the Globe and Mail positions, which were being eliminated immediately, the company required someone to remain in the E-Contact position for the time being. Mr. Virk stated in his testimony that this meeting was a bombshell for him.\n[77] According to Mr. Makdessian, those attending the November 5, 2003 meeting were told that all those having more than eight years of service had, under the collective agreement, the opportunity to exercise their displacement right and that if they wished to do so, they could contact the union or the management team to further get explanation on the displacement option. The CTEA Clerical and Associated Employees collective agreement specifically deals with the issue of displacement.\n[78] The evidence shows that the employees were also told that they would have until November 12, 2003 to exercise their displacement right. This period was later extended to November 19, 2003. They were finally told that if they chose to exercise their displacement right, they would need to integrate into the chosen position within 21 days without any formal training.\n[79] At the hearing, Mr. Virk was unable to recall Mr. Makdessian explaining to the employees present on November 5, 2003, that employees, such as himself, who had eight years of service or more, could use their displacement right on a position held by employees who had less than eight years, that employees had one week from November, 5, 2003 to exercise their displacement right and that if they wanted to exercise their displacement rights, they would have to advise their manager.\n[80] The evidence shows that Mr. Virk could have displaced four Resource Associates, who had not been declared surplus, in the Vendor Management Group. In his testimony, Mr. Virk acknowledged that he had more service than these four individuals and that he would have been qualified to do their job. He, however, stated that it was never specifically put to him by Mr. Makdessian that he could have displaced them. In his testimony, Mr. Virk stated that had he known about this fact, he would have exercised his displacement right.\n[81] The evidence shows that none of the employees declared surplus on November 5, 2003 did in fact exercise their displacement right. Asked to provide an explanation, Mr. Makdessian stated that it was not surprising given that a lot of people felt uncomfortable in putting somebody else out of a job. According to Mr. Makdessian, historically few employees had ever exercised their displacement right.\n[82] After the November 5, 2003 meeting, Mr. Makdessian sent a letter to Mr. Virk confirming that his employment with Bell Canada would end on January 11, 2004. In the letter, Mr. Virk is informed of the opportunity for redeployment within Bell and apprised of the rules pertaining to salary continuance, benefits and pension plan, etc. The letter contains however no information on displacement rights.\n[83] The evidence shows that on November 11, 2003, Mr. Makdessian met with Mr. Virk. In his testimony, Mr. Virk acknowledged that, in the course of the meeting, Mr. Makdessian reviewed with him the various options that he had, given the fact that he had been declared surplus. Mr. Virk also acknowledged that Mr. Makdessian inquired as to how his job search was progressing and told him that both he and Mr. Singh would be of assistance to him throughout this ordeal.\n[84] Mr. Virk testified that, at the time, he informed Mr. Makdessian that he wished to look for other opportunities and that the had applied for a Resource Associate position in the Direct Marketing Centre Business group and was looking forward to a response. The evidence shows that he never received one.\n[85] In his testimony, Mr. Makdessian stated that he identified to Mr. Virk that the E-Contact position, albeit temporary, was available and that he was qualified to move into that job if he so desired. According to Mr. Virk, the E-Contact job was the only job that Mr. Makdessian mentioned. Mr. Makdessian never spoke of Mr. Virk's displacement right with respect to the other Resource Associates of the Vendor Management Group.\n[86] Mr. Makdessian testified that, at the meeting, Mr. Virk mentioned to him that he did not want to pursue the Resource Associate position in E-Contact further because it was temporary in nature. This is acknowledged by Mr. Virk. According to Mr. Makdessian, Mr. Virk was quite passionate about the fact that he would not feel comfortable pushing someone else out of a position.\n[87] According to Mr. Makdessian, the surplus tag on the E-Contact position held by Ms. Anderson was removed after November 11, 2003. It appears from the evidence that Ms. Anderson had been able to convince both the respondent and the union that it made no sense to declare her position, albeit temporary, surplus given the fact that the position was not at that stage being eliminated. The status of Ms. Anderson was thus changed.\n[88] Asked what impact this decision had on Ms. Anderson, Mr. Makdessian stated that it had a major impact on her for if Bell had not done so, she would have lost her job in January 2002. But given that no one was prepared to exercise his or her displacement right, the company and the union concluded that it was the fair thing to do to leave her in her temporary position. According to Mr. Makdessian, this decision was seen both by the respondent and the union as having no impact on other employees' displacement rights because any employee could still have exercised his displacement right regardless of that decision.\n[89] Mr. Makdessian acknowledged in his testimony that he did not inform Mr. Virk of the removal of the surplus status on the E-Contact position held by Ms. Anderson. Asked why he did not do so after November 11, 2003, Mr. Makdessian stated that the decision had no impact on Mr. Virk's status, that the latter still had the option, as did any employee having eight years of service, to exercise his displacement right if he chose to do so. Given the fact that Mr. Virk had made it clear to him that he would feel uncomfortable in doing so, Mr. Makdessian did not see any need to go back to Mr. Virk.\n[90] The evidence shows that, on November 27, 2003, Mr. Virk approached Mr. Makdessian seeking to understand the rationale as to why Ms. Anderson's E-Contact job was no longer declared surplus. Mr. Makdessian explained to Mr. Virk that whether or not Ms. Anderson was declared surplus had no impact on his ability to transition into the Resource Associate role she held, a thing he could have done when the window of opportunity was available. In his testimony, Mr. Makdessian acknowledged that on November 27, 2003, it was too late for Mr. Virk to exercise his displacement right.\n[91] Mr. Makdessian further explained to Mr. Virk that not declaring the E-Contact position as surplus did not in any way imply that the E-Contact role was permanent, the future of the E-Contact role still being uncertain at that point.\n[92] The record shows that on December 4, 2003, Mr. Virk sent to Mr. Makdessian, as well as to Mr. Charlie Latino and Mr. Ron Singh, an e-mail regarding misinformation about the E-Contact surplus. On December 8, 2003, as well as on December 10 and 11, 2003, Mr. Makdessian tried to locate Mr. Virk without success.\n[93] On December 11, 2003, Mr. Virk sent an e-mail to Mr. Makdessian indicating that he would be available to meet with him the following day. Mr. Makdessian confirmed that he was available.\n[94] On December 12, 2003, Mr. Virk called Mr. Makdessian to inform him that he could not attend the meeting. A new meeting was scheduled for December 15, 2003. However, on the morning of December 15, 2003, Mr. Virk called Mr. Makdessian telling him that he was no longer available but that he might be able to meet with him on December 17, 2003.\n[95] The record shows that, on December 12, 2003, Mr. Virk filed a grievance against the respondent alleging that its failure to give him correct information had resulted in him missing an opportunity to displace a more junior Resource Associate in the E-Contact Group.\n[96] At the hearing, Mr. Virk acknowledged that he also filed a grievance against his union for having misrepresented him. Mr. Virk stated that he holds the union partly responsible for not having informed him of the removal of the surplus tag on Ms. Anderson's position.\n[97] On December 17, 2003, a meeting was held between Ms. Sonia Bell, a union representative from the CTEA, Mr. Makdessian and Mr. Virk to discuss the grievance regarding the company's failure to inform Mr. Virk of the change in surplus status for Ms. Anderson.\n[98] The record shows that Ms. Bell explained to Mr. Makdessian that Mr. Virk felt misled about the company's position regarding the E-Contact position. According to Mr. Makdessian, Ms. Bell, who was not called as a witness, stated that had Mr. Virk been informed of the decision to remove the surplus tag on Ms. Anderson, Mr. Virk might have wanted to exercise his displacement right.\n[99] Mr. Makdessian testified that he told Ms. Bell that removing the surplus tag from Karen Anderson did not influence Mr. Virk's ability to exercise his displacement right if he had chosen to do so. Nor did the removal of the tag change the temporary nature of the job.\n[100] On December 23, 2003, Mr. Makdessian denied the grievance after meeting with Ms. Sonia Bell. Mr. Makdessian testified that with Ms. Bell, he went over the reasons as to why Mr. Virk wanted to displace Ms. Anderson, as well as what was said at the meeting held on November 5, 2003, a meeting attended by Ms. Bell. According to Mr. Makdessian, Ms. Bell fully agreed with what had been said by Mr. Makdessian at the meeting. The evidence shows that on January 13, 2004, Mr. Virk's grievance was presented to Ms. Maria Arpino and was denied.\n[101] Mr. Virk's employment with Bell ended on January 11, 2004. The evidence shows that the status of the E-Contact position had not changed at the time of the hearing. It was still temporary.\n[102] The Globe and Mail project resumed on February 1, 2004. Asked why the Globe and Mail project was revived in 2004, Mr. Makdessian testified that in January 2004, the Globe and Mail consultants contacted Ms. Arpino, saying that they wanted to re-open the issue of the price point. A meeting was held during which a new price point structure was proposed.\n[103] According to Mr. Makdessian, the decision to revive the project was taken the same day or the day after the meeting. Asked to comment on why the project was so quick in running again in the latter part of January 2004, Mr. Makdessian stated that none of the applications had been removed given that no other project had been planned to replace it.\n[104] The evidence shows that the resumption of the Globe and Mail project was accompanied by changes to the structure of the Globe and Mail team. The positions of Resource Associate held by Mr. Virk as well as that of Associate held by Ms. Young were abolished. A Team Coordinator position was created in order to assist the Sales Manager, Mr. Ron Singh who had previously been the Sales manager on the project. According to the evidence, Mr. Rakesh Sharma, already a team leader, was given the job. The evidence shows that the Team Coordinator position is one covered by the CTEA Sales Collective Agreement as opposed to the Clerical Collective Agreement that applied to Mr. Virk.\n[105] Furthermore, a lot of the processes were streamlined and automated. According to Mr. Makdessian, a lot less administrative work was required with the new structure, the focus being put on coaching people to sales success. In this context, the position of Team Coordinator was more in tune with the new structure than that of Resource Associate.\nIII. ANALYSIS [106] There are two issues before the Tribunal. The first one pertains to the allegation that Mr. Virk was discriminated against by Bell in the course of employment through the acts of Mr. Weich on the ground that Mr. Virk is of South Asian descent (discrimination issue). The second one pertains to the allegation that Mr. Makdessian retaliated against Mr. Virk for filing his human rights complaint (retaliation issue).\n[107] As for the first issue, Mr. Virk alleges that the discrimination occurred when he was demoted, as stated by Mr. Virk, from an Acting Manager position to his previously held Resource Associate position as of January 2, 2002 rather than being confirmed as a Sales Manager effective January 2, 2002, this occurring because he is of South Asian descent.\n[108] In this regard, Mr. Virk seeks, amongst other things, that the respondent provide him with a management position based on his performance and on the opportunity that he had in January 2002 of becoming a manager. It is Mr. Virk's view that he was at the time ready for a management position, that he should have become then a confirmed manager. In support of his claim, Mr. Virk relies on the fact that two unionized employees who are Caucasian got acting assignments in January 2002 and were later confirmed as managers.\n[109] As for the second issue, Mr. Virk's main allegation is that the retaliation occurred when he was not told by Mr. Makdessian that the employee who had been declared surplus, Ms. Karen Anderson, was no longer surplus as of mid-November 2003. Mr. Virk also identified as an act of retaliation the fact that in November 2003, Mr. Makdessian never identified, apart from Ms. Karen Anderson, who the other Resource Associates were that he could have displaced. Mr. Virk went as far as saying that he considered as part of the retaliation events of 2002 leading to it without identifying these events.\nA. THE DISCRIMINATION ISSUE [110] It is one thing to allege discrimination. It is another to prove it. Discrimination is generally subtle and thus often hard to prove. Still the person alleging discrimination in an employment context must present evidence that will bring a Tribunal to conclude that discrimination played a role in that person not getting a position.\n[111] Here, Mr. Virk had the burden of proving that, on January 2, 2002, he was discriminated against because he is of South Asian descent. Mr. Virk had to prove facts that would lead the Tribunal to conclude that one of the reasons why he was not kept as a manager on the Globe and Mail project as of January 2, 2002 was because of his ethnic origin.\n[112] To support his allegations that Mr. Weich discriminated against him, Mr. Virk referred to an array of situations, firstly, that Mr. Weich used South Asians only in support functions, secondly that most of the support staff in Mr. Weich's section is of South Asian origin and none of his managers are of South Asian descent, a fact that is highlighted by Exhibit R-4, thirdly that, since 1998, Mr. Weich never hired a South Asian as a manager and, fourthly that, in 1998, the only South Asian manager working when Mr. Weich joined the Vendor Management section left within a year.\n[113] Mr. Virk also relied on an e-mail dated October 22, 2001 to show that all five Associate Directors whose names appear on the e-mail are Caucasian and that the managers were mainly Caucasian. Mr. Virk confirmed however that amongst the people he identified as Caucasian were people from Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Greek descent.\n[114] To further buttress his allegation that Bell discriminated against him, Mr. Virk relied on the fact that Bell has failed to keep up with the changes relating to visible minorities in the Canadian workforce and that the people in the upper management in the Ontario Direct Marketing Centre Organization are all Caucasians.\n[115] At the hearing, Mr. Weich strongly denied having discriminated against Mr. Virk in November 2001 because he is of South Asian descent. He acknowledged that Mr. Virk did qualify to retain the Globe and Mail management position based on performance as of January 1, 2002. However, he stated that the sole reason why Mr. Virk reverted to his Resource Associate position in January 2002 was because it had been decided that the position of manager on the Globe and Mail project, in a context of rightsizing, should be filled by a confirmed manager so as to protect that person's job.\n[116] In response to Mr. Virk's claim that Mr. Weich discriminated against him on January 2, 2002, the respondent relied, firstly, on the fact that Mr. Weich had, in the past, filled managerial positions within his group with people from visible minorities, secondly, that the composition of his group in March 2003 reflected a diversity of cultural backgrounds: Jamaican, Armenian, Indian, Afghan, South American, South Asian, Black, Arab, Mediterranean, Filipino, Asian. Thirdly, the respondent put in evidence a picture taken in the summer of 2003 of Mr. Weich's Vendor Management Team to illustrate its claim that the employees working in the Direct Marketing Centre came from different cultural backgrounds. At the hearing, Mr. Virk made the point that in the picture, there are three individuals of South Asian descent but none of them are Sales Managers. Mr. Weich acknowledged that fact in his testimony.\n[117] Asked why he had not hired a person of South Asian descent as a manager from 1998 onward, Mr. Weich stated that when he is hiring, he is looking for the best possible candidate.\n(i) State of the law [118] In a human rights case, the burden of proof lies with the complainant. This said, the case law requires that the complainant, in order to be successful, imperatively make from the outset a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[119] In Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., [2004] F.C.J. No. 941, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the decisions in O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 and Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, provide the basic guidance for what is required of a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[120] According to O'Malley, a prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a finding in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. According to Etobicoke, once a complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, he is entitled to relief in the absence of a justification by the respondent. The justification provided by the respondent must not be a mere pretext or a disguise for the respondent's otherwise discriminatory conduct.\n[121] Thus, if the respondent is able to prove conclusively that the decision reached in relation to the complainant was not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination, the complaint must be dismissed.\n[122] With respect to the establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination in an employment context, tribunals have generally referred to the Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited, (1981) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 and Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission, (1983) 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 decisions. In Lincoln, the Federal Court of Appeal stated, however, that the decisions in Shakes and Israeli are but illustrations of the application of the guidance referred to above.\n[123] In the case at hand, the respondent is of the view that the complainant has failed to even make a prima facie case of discrimination and that if he did, the respondent provided an explanation which is not a mere pretext.\n(ii) Review of the evidence [124] The evidence shows that Mr. Virk strongly believed that he should have continued managing the Globe and Mail project on January 2, 2002 because of his skills and experience and given the fact that he was more qualified than the confirmed manager who replaced him. According to Mr. Virk, it would have made prudent business sense for Bell Canada to retain the most qualified employee as manager on the Globe and Mail project.\n[125] Mr. Virk testified that he felt that, on January 2, 2002, all of his accomplishments and capabilities were overlooked, that he was deprived of immediate and future potential opportunities of being confirmed as a manager. The decision not to let him continue to manage the Globe and Mail project took away the prospect of his career growth as a manager at Bell Canada. The evidence shows that Mr. Virk found it humiliating and hurtful to go back to his Resource Associate position after having been Acting Manager.\n[126] Time and again in the present proceedings, Mr. Virk referred to the fact that, on January 2, 2002, he was demoted from Acting Manager to Resource Associate on the Globe and Mail project and asserted that this demotion was related to the fact that he is of South Asian descent and not Caucasian.\n[127] For example, in his complaint, Mr. Virk asserts that the respondent discriminated against him by demoting him, that he was told on November 30, 2001 by his Associate Director, Mr. Ted Weich, that he was going to be demoted from his position as acting manager and placed in a position of Resource Associate on the same project, that the demotion was not related to his performance, that his demotion would be effective January 1, 2002, and that he believed that he was demoted because of his national or ethnic origin. (Emphasis added)\n[128] In his final submissions, Mr. Virk again reiterated that Bell Canada discriminated against him in the course of his employment on the grounds of national or ethnic origin, by demoting him contrary to section 7 of the Act. According to Mr. Virk, the only reason why he was demoted to a non-management Resource Associate position on January 2, 2002, was because of his national or ethnic origin, i.e. South Asian.\n[129] Mr. Virk argued that the reasons provided by Bell to support its decision to return him to his unionized Resource Associate position on January 2, 2002 are implausible. According to Mr. Virk, at the time of his demotion, there was no rightsizing going on at Bell and acting managers were still being appointed. That confirmed managers were at risk of losing their jobs is strongly disputed by Mr. Virk.\n[130] The Tribunal finds that the evidence does not support Mr. Virk's allegation that he was demoted on January 1, 2002. The evidence shows that Mr. Virk was given in October 2001 an acting manager position on the Globe and Mail project that ended when the Globe and Mail project was temporarily shut down in November 2001. The fact of reverting to one's previous unionized position cannot be interpreted by any stretch of the imagination as a demotion.\n[131] On this point, the evidence clearly establishes that, at the time he was given an acting manager assignment on the Globe and Mail project, in November 2001, Mr. Virk was a Resource Associate in the Vendor Management Group of Mr. Ted Weich in the Direct Marketing Centre and a unionized employee governed by the CTEA Clerical and Associated Employees Collective Agreement.\n[132] As the evidence shows, the fact of being given an acting assignment does not in itself guarantee that at the end of the assignment, the person will be confirmed as a manager.\n[133] The Tribunal finds that Mr. Virk's acting manager assignment on the Globe and Mail project in the fall of 2002 was temporary in nature and that once the acting assignment was over, it was not unusual, contrary to what Mr. Virk asserts, for him to revert to his former position, that of Resource Associate.\n[134] The evidence shows that prior to his acting assignment on the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Virk had had only two other acting assignments, one of which was not in a managerial context. The evidence also suggests that Ms. Debbie Vieira had eight acting assignments in 2002 and only became a confirmed manager in 2003. Thus, no matter how many acting manager positions one has held in the past, being confirmed as a manager at the end of an acting assignment is not automatic.\n[135] After a careful review of the evidence, the Tribunal finds that the respondent provided a reasonable explanation as to why Mr. Penno Makdessian, a confirmed manager, was asked to take over the Globe and Mail project in January 2002 and Mr. Virk's acting assignment was not extended beyond December 2001.\n[136] The evidence shows that Mr. Makdessian had the sales experience that the job required, that given the impetus that Bell wanted to give to the Globe and Mail project, Mr. Makdessian was seen as the right candidate for the job. In addition, because of the rightsizing context prevailing in the Direct Marketing Centre, priority was given to confirmed managers in order to secure their job.\n[137] The Tribunal shares the view that, in any organization, the employer has the right to determine which employee will be assigned to perform a certain job. Many elements can come into play when making such a decision. As stated in Hill v. Air Canada, 2003 CHRT 9, it is not the role of the Tribunal to fine-tune these kinds of decisions that are beyond its expertise. The role of the Tribunal is to inquire if the decision was in part based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[138] As to the representations made by Mr. Weich to Mr. Virk on November 30, 2001 that there would be no more acting managers or new manager assignments in his department as of November 2001 and the fact that two acting managers were subsequently appointed, given the evidence, the Tribunal cannot find or infer that Mr. Virk was not chosen because he is of South Asian descent or that he had been lied to by Mr. Weich.\n[139] The fact of the matter is that in April 2002, Mr. Virk was given a new acting position on the Globe and Mail project that lasted until October 2002. He was again appointed acting Sales Manager on the project in August 2003.\n[140] The fact that Mr. Weich has since 1998 never hired a person of South Asian descent as manager does not in itself prove or give rise to a presumption that Mr. Weich is someone who discriminates against individuals of South Asian descent. As mentioned previously, asked by Mr. Virk why he had not hired a manager of South Asian descent since 1998, Mr. Weich answered that when he is hiring, he is looking for the best possible candidate for the job irrespective of the person's ethnic background.\n[141] The evidence shows also that Mr. Weich has on his Vendor Management Team individuals of South Asian descent who do not seem to have complained of any discrimination on his part. No evidence to that effect was put before the Tribunal. In addition, the evidence shows that Mr. Singh, the confirmed manager in charge of the Globe and Mail project from October 2002 to August 2003 is of South Asian descent.\n[142] That a list of names contains more names of people who are Caucasian (Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Spanish) than of any other ethnic origin, such as people from South Asian, African, Middle Eastern or Far Eastern descent, does not in itself give rise to an inference of discrimination against people having a specific cultural background.\n[143] Nor does the fact that an organization such as Bell does not meet the national profile for the number of managers from visible minorities at large employed at Bell. This type of information will usually be useful to prove that the working environment supports an inference, based on the prima facie test, that there was, in all probability, discrimination.\n[144] In any event, there is a further reason for dismissing Mr. Virk's discrimination complaint. Part of Mr. Virk's case is based on the fact that it is Mr. Weich who discriminated against him when, in January 2, 2002 he was reverted to his Resource Associate position and was not asked to continue managing the Globe and Mail project.\n[145] The evidence shows that it was Mr. Latino who decided to hire Mr. Makdessian as Sales Manager on the Globe and Mail project in November 2001 and to revert Mr. Virk to his former Resource Associate position. Thus, the allegation made by Mr. Virk against Mr. Weich that the latter discriminated against him because he is of South Asian descent when he was not hired or confirmed as manager on the Globe and Mail project in January 2002 lacks any evidentiary basis.\n[146] As stated above, a prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a finding in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[147] After having carefully reviewed the evidence, the Tribunal finds no basis for Mr. Virk's allegation that he was discriminated against when he was not confirmed as a manager or given a new acting manager assignment on the Globe and Mail project because he is of South Asian descent.\n[148] The Tribunal finds that the explanation provided by the respondent as to why Mr. Virk was not confirmed as a manager in January 2002 on the Globe and Mail project is not pretextual but wholly credible in view of the evidence and that it cannot reasonably be inferred from the evidence that the failure to offer Mr. Virk a management position on the Globe and Mail project in the fall of 2001 was at least in part due to the fact that Mr. Virk is of South Asian descent.\n[149] Hence, given the allegations found in Mr. Virk's complaint, the evidence and the criteria set out in Etobicoke and O'Malley, the explanation provided by the respondent, the Tribunal rules that Mr. Virk has not established a prima facie case of discrimination.\nB. THE ISSUE OF RETALIATION [150] On March 5, 2004, Mr. Virk amended his complaint to allege that Bell Canada retaliated against him by terminating his employment for having filed a human rights complaint.\n[151] In his amended complaint, Mr. Virk alleges that Bell brought an end in November 2003 to the Globe and Mail project to which he had been assigned and utilized this situation to disguise its retaliation against him.\n[152] Mr. Virk blames Bell and, more specifically, Mr. Makdessian for having misled him when, firstly, the latter did not inform him that the surplus tag on Ms. Anderson's position, the E-Contact position, had been removed, thus preventing him from exercising his displacement right at the time. Mr. Virk also blames Mr. Makdessian for having failed to inform him that he could have displaced, in addition to Ms. Anderson, other Resource Associates with less seniority in the Vendor Management Group. Mr. Virk sees these failures as negligence as well as acts of retaliation on the part of Mr. Makdessian and states that had he been informed of these facts, he would have exercised his displacement right and would still be working at Bell Canada today.\n[153] Mr. Makdessian strongly denies that he retaliated against Mr. Virk when he did not inform the latter of the change of status of the E-Contact position, being of the view that this information was not pertinent to the exercise of Mr. Virk's displacement right. Furthermore, repeatedly in his testimony, Mr. Makdessian stated that, given that Mr. Virk had clearly identified to him that he felt uncomfortable in bumping anyone out of a position and was very emotional and passionate about it, he did not feel that it was pertinent for him to inform Mr. Virk of that change.\n[154] On the whole, Bell denies having retaliated against Mr. Virk because the latter had brought a human rights complaint against it, that all the decisions that were taken in relation to the Globe and Mail project and Mr. Virk's employment at Bell were strictly business based.\n(i) State of the law [155] Under section 14.1 of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[156] Retaliation implies some form of willful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint. This view departs in part from those expressed in previous decisions of this Tribunal on the issue of retaliation (Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] CHRT 11; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40).\n[157] In Wong and Bressette, the views expressed are to the effect that a complainant does not have to prove an intention to retaliate and that if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation to the human rights complaint, this could amount to retaliation quite apart form any proven intention of the respondent. (Italics added)\n[158] The burden of proving retaliation rests with the complainant who must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the person against whom he or she alleges retaliation knew of the existence of the complaint, that the person acted in an inopportune way and that the person's misbehaviour was motivated by the filing of a human rights complaint by the complainant. Retaliation being a form of discrimination under the Act, the same evidentiary burden should apply to allegations of discrimination and retaliation.\n[159] Thus, proof on the part of the complainant that the person who is alleged to have retaliated knew of the existence of the complaint and that he or she acted in an inopportune way may give rise to a prima facie case of retaliation requiring the alleged retaliator to come forth with a reasonable explanation as to the reasons for his actions. If the explanation given is not credible, the Tribunal should find the allegation of retaliation substantiated.\n(ii) Review of the evidence [160] In his testimony, Mr. Makdessian stated that he only became aware of Mr. Virk's complaint in January 2003. This statement was never proven false. The claim made by Mr. Virk that the retaliation started in 2002 must thus be dismissed. Thus remains to be examined events that took place after January 2003 which Mr. Virk considers as retaliatory measures.\n[161] Firstly, Mr. Virk considers as an act of retaliation the fact the Mr. Makdessian did not inform him of the removal of the surplus tag on Ms. Karen Anderson's E-Contact position. The evidence indicates that the surplus tag on the E-Contact position was removed after November 11, 2003.\n[162] There is undisputed evidence that Mr. Makdessian did not inform Mr. Virk of the removal of the surplus tag on the E-Contact position. Asked repeatedly why he had not convey that information to Mr. Virk, Mr. Makdessian stated that, given that Mr. Virk had clearly made it known to him previously that he felt uncomfortable in displacing a fellow employee, Mr. Makdessian saw no need to inform him of the change. Furthermore, Mr. Makdessian felt that the change of status had no bearing on Mr. Virk's right of displacement.\n[163] The fact that Mr. Virk was not informed that Ms. Anderson's position was not being eliminated does not by itself prove retaliation on the part of the respondent. Given that the change in status of the position had no impact on Mr. Virk's right of displacement, the Tribunal finds that this fact did not constitute pertinent information in the circumstances. Had the evidence shown otherwise, an inference could have been drawn that this inopportune behaviour constituted retaliation on the part of Mr. Makdessian.\n[164] Secondly, Mr. Virk considers as an act of retaliation the fact that Mr. Makdessian did not specifically advise him that he could displace four Resource Associates working in the Direct Marketing Centre, as well as Ms. Anderson.\n[165] The evidence shows that on November 5, 2003, the people attending the meeting called by Mr. Makdessian were clearly informed of the displacement procedure and told that if they wanted details on the procedure, they could go see their Union Representative or their Manager.\n[166] It however stems from the evidence that Mr. Makdessian never specifically identified to Mr. Virk the four Resource Associates within the Direct Marketing Centre that the latter could have displaced apart from Ms. Karen Anderson. Did Mr. Makdessian have to be that specific?\n[167] The Tribunal finds that there is nothing in the evidence that indicates that Mr. Makdessian should have identified by name the individuals Mr. Virk could have displaced and that by not doing so Mr. Makdessian acted improperly and tried to mislead Mr. Virk with respect to his different options. It was open to Mr. Virk to enquire as to whom he could displace.\n[168] Aware of the fact that he could lose his job, Mr. Virk should have sought from his union as well as management additional information as to the exercise of his displacement right. The fact of the matter is that Mr. Virk is blaming not only Bell Canada but also the CTEA for not having provided him with the information he felt was relevant to his decision whether to exercise his right of displacement and alleges negligence on their part. In this context, the Tribunal finds no wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Makdessian, let alone any form of retaliation.\n[169] Hence, the Tribunal rules that the complainant has not conclusively, on a balance of probabilities, established a prima facie case of retaliation.\nIV. CONCLUSION [170] The Tribunal rules that the Complainant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin and that, in any event, the respondent provided a reasonable explanation as to why the Complainant was not confirmed as Manager on the Globe and Mail project in January 2002.\n[171] The Tribunal also rules that the Complainant failed to establish that he was retaliated against for having filed a human rights complaint when Mr. Makdessian failed to inform him of the change of status of the E-Contact position and of the possibility for him to displace Resource Associates other than Ms. Anderson.\n[172] For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 20, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT858\/10803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRoger Virk v.

THE MOTION [1] The Motion is based on the complaints filed by Dr. Shiv Chopra. The situation is fairly simple. As a result of the extensive litigation, the Respondent says that a number of allegations in the complaints are subject to the doctrine of issue estoppel. They have already been litigated.\n[2] There is a long history of litigation between Dr. Chopra and the Respondent. Dr. Chopra has been before the Tribunal in two previous cases. They have also been adversaries in the Federal Court, and before the Public Service Staff Relations Board, now the Public Service Labour Relations Board. I have not counted, but the parties have been legal contestants on numerous occasions.\n[3] The Respondent's primary concerns arise out of the findings of Mr. Hadjis in Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare) [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 20 (QL). There were also findings in National Capital Alliance on Race Relations (NCARR) v. Canada (Health and Welfare), 1997 CHRD No. 3 (QL), however, which dealt with a complaint against the same employer under section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Then there is the other litigation.\n[4] The Respondent's Notice of Motion asks me to strike out certain aspects of the complaint. This is problematic. The Tribunal is master of its own process and has every right to supervise the inquiry. It has no authority over the referral process, however. It is the Commission that decides what will be referred to the Tribunal. I do not see how I can strike passages from the complaints without implicitly undermining the authority of the Commission and entering into the referral process.\n[5] This does not prevent the Tribunal from amending the complaints or deciding what is properly before it. Amendments are one thing; deletions another. There are exceptional situations, but as a general rule I do not think that I can remove passages from documents that originate outside the process. The Respondent has other sources of redress. I see no difficulty, for example, with an application to strike out paragraphs of the Statement of Particulars. The review of pleadings comes within the normal scope of the Tribunal's functions.\n[6] The problem in the immediate case is that the pleadings have yet to be exchanged. I think a colloquial phrase probably says it best: the parties are getting ahead of themselves. It is too early to deal with the niceties of the case and the Motion is premature. I am nevertheless satisfied that some direction would be of assistance to the parties.\nII. SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS [7] It may be helpful to comment on the specific allegations that concern the Respondent.\nA. Allegation 1. [8] The first is the alleged failure to appoint Dr. Chopra to the position of Director, Bureau of Veterinary Affairs in 1993. I agree with the Respondent, in saying that this issue has already been litigated.\n[9] The simplest observation is chronological. Dr. Chopra has already obtained a finding of discrimination for the events that took place up until 1992. The Tribunal that found in his favour, however, received evidence relating to events that took place between 1992 and 1994. That evidence was presented by the Commission, on behalf of Dr. Chopra, and clearly formed part of Dr. Chopra's case. He had the benefit of this evidence.\n[10] Mr. Hadjis appears to have treated this evidence as circumstantial evidence, which might bolster the Complainant's case. All I will say, at this time, however, is that the parties are bound by his findings. If either side were unhappy with his decision, their remedy lay in the Federal Court.\nB. Allegation 2. [11] The second allegation concerns an internal complaint that was lodged against Dr. Chopra in 1993. This was described as an attempt to discredit him. There was evidence with regard to these aspects of the matter before Mr. Hadjis, who found that the motives of the person who laid the complaint were not racial. Although it would be a mistake to go into the details of Mr. Hadjis' decision, I want to make it clear that the parties are bound by his findings.\n[12] Mr. Yazbeck goes further, however. He states that the Complainant wants to call evidence with respect to the Respondent's handling of the matter. This may or may not raise a new set of issues, which are properly before me. It is difficult to say, at this point in time. Any decision on the precise questions that might arise in this respect will have to be decided at the appropriate time.\nC. Allegation 3. [13] The third allegation relates to a document referred to as the Cuddihy memo. This document has apparently played a prominent role in the three hearings that have already taken place. It clearly played a part in Mr. Hadjis' finding of discrimination.\n[14] There are two aspects to the matter. The first goes to the merits of the complaint. At this point, I cannot see any reason why the Complainant would need to rely on the document, since the Tribunal is already bound by Mr. Hadjis' finding that he was discriminated against in the 1992 period.\n[15] These comments do not exhaust the issue. It may still be necessary to provide the Tribunal with a certain amount of evidence to establish the context in which the later events took place. These kinds of issues should be vetted when the material allegations in the case have been clarified, either in the pleadings or during the course of testimony.\nD. Allegation 4. [16] The fourth allegation is that the Respondent failed to comply with the order of the Tribunal in National Capital Alliance on Race Relations (NCARR) v. Canada (Health and Welfare). The Respondent says that the Complainant was not a party to the hearing and has no standing in the matter. It has also provided the Tribunal with a letter from the Chief Commissioner, stating that the Respondent has complied with the order. I agree with the Respondent than any question of compliance must be dealt with in the Federal Court, as contemplated by the Act.\n[17] The matter goes further. Mr. Yazbeck stated that Dr. Chopra discussed the question of compliance with his superiors. I cannot say whether these conversations go to the substance of the more recent allegations or have a bearing on the present inquiry. The relevance of this kind of evidence needs to be decided in the course of the hearing, when circumstances permit a proper evaluation of the interests at stake.\nE. Allegation 5. [18] There is also a dispute over a ruling by the Public Service Staff Relations Board with respect to a five day suspension. There was debate as to the exact significance of the Board's ruling. This is not the time or place to deal with technical legal questions. At this point, it is enough to say that it is not the role of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to review the findings and decisions made by another adjudicative body within the proper scope of its responsibilities. It follows that the parties are not entitled to re-litigate the issue that went before the Staff Relations Board.\nF. Allegation 6. [19] Finally, there are allegations relating to Dr. Chopra's failure to obtain the Director's position in the Bureau of Veterinary Affairs during the period of 1997 to 1998. This was long after the period of time covered by the previous complaints, but before Mr. Hadjis dealt with the question of remedy.\n[20] I cannot see that it matters. These allegations come squarely within the four corners of the present complaints. They were never before Mr. Hadjis. I do not see how it can be said that the factual and legal issues arising out of these allegations have been litigated. Issue estoppel does not apply.\nIII. CONCLUSIONS [21] I have already stated that the present motion is premature. The issues that it raises have not been properly defined by the parties. The Tribunal has held on many occasions that rulings on evidentiary or procedural matters should be dealt with when the relevant interests have properly materialized before the Tribunal. It is a mistake to rule on these matters too early, before the repercussions of any ruling have become apparent.\n[22] The Canadian Human Rights Act guarantees all of the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their cases. I agree with the Commission that the Tribunal's procedural mandate, in the process leading up to the hearing, is governed by a principle of caution. The Tribunal should be careful not to deprive a complainant of the opportunity to put its full case before the member hearing the matter. It is far too early in the process to determine the exact parameters of the inquiry.\n[23] I should probably add that, in my view, the scope of the present inquiry is relatively broad. The Complainant has had an opportunity to tell his story to the Tribunal, roughly until 1994. The story does not end there, however. There is a sequel. As I understand it, he now intends to take up the narrative and continue it, until the date of his termination. He is entitled to do so.\n[24] I think the parties agree that it would be a mistake to contemplate other hearings in the future. One of the purposes of inquiries is to provide some finality to these kinds of disputes. I accordingly think the Complainant should be given the latitude he needs to present any allegations of discrimination that continue into the present. This will hopefully resolve the issues between the two sides, once and for all.\nIV. RULING [25] All I can say, on the Motion, is that the parties are bound by the findings of the Tribunal in previous cases. They are not entitled to re-litigate issues that have already been decided. It is for the Tribunal to decide, as a matter of judgement, whether allegations or evidence cross into the same territory that was the subject of a finding by a previous Tribunal. Specific objections should be dealt with when they arise.\n[26] It may still be necessary to make some reference to the events that form the subject of earlier findings, simply for the purpose of providing the present Tribunal with some history of the relations between the parties. This is a necessary part of the inquiry. It is well recognized that contextual evidence is of particular assistance in the human rights process.\n[27] I have already directed the Complainants to file their Statement of Particulars by June 17 th, 2005. If the Respondent feels that the particulars go beyond the legitimate scope of the complaints, it should raise the matter as expeditiously as possible.\nSigned by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMay 30, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT901\/2104\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCris Basudde and Shiv Chopra v.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 22 2005\/06\/15\n[1] On February 28, 2002, Jim Smith filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that Canadian National Railway (CN) has been discriminating against him in employment on the basis of his disability.\n[2] On May 19, 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry. CN is now requesting an order indicating that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint because the matter has already been decided in another forum.\nI. BACKGROUND [3] Mr. Smith began working for CN in April, 1979. In November, 1997, Mr. Smith hurt his back while working. The Workers' Compensation Board provided him with compensation benefits. A number of efforts were made to return Mr. Smith to his job as a train engineer. These efforts ultimately failed.\n[4] In June, 2002, Mr. Smith's union advanced a grievance on his behalf alleging that the Company had contravened the Collective Agreement by failing to accommodate Mr. Smith's disability. The grievance was heard before Arbitrator Michel Picher.\n[5] Arbitrator Picher rendered a decision on July 14, 2003 in which he dismissed the grievance. In his decision, Arbitrator Picher held that CN had fulfilled its responsibilities under the Collective Agreement and the Canadian Human Rights Act to accommodate Mr. Smith.\n[6] On December 3, 2003, Mr. Smith and his union filed an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. On August 5, 2004, prior to a hearing on the merits, the application for judicial review was discontinued.\n[7] In June and July of 2003, Mr. Smith was given an opportunity to train for a new position as a Traffic Coordinator in Prince George, British Columbia. If he successfully completed the training program, Mr. Smith was to be offered the Traffic Coordinator position. However, CN decided to terminate the program before Mr. Smith had completed it.\n[8] Shortly after the training program was aborted, the WCB terminated the vocational rehabilitation assistance it had been providing to Mr. Smith.\n[9] Mr. Smith appealed the decision to terminate the WCB assistance he had been receiving. The decision was subsequently upheld by a Workers' Compensation Review Officer on July 12, 2004.\n[10] On July 29, 2003, CN wrote to the Canadian Human Rights Commission to request that the human rights complaint that Mr. Smith had filed in February, 2002, be dismissed on the grounds that the issues in the complaint had already been fully resolved by Arbitrator Picher in his decision of July 14, 2003.\n[11] On May 19, 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry.\nII. ANALYSIS A. The Commission's Decision to Refer the Complaint to the Tribunal [12] Mr. Smith argues that the Commission's decision to refer the complaint for further inquiry cannot now be reviewed by this Tribunal. However, in my view, the present motion does not involve a review of the Commission's decision.\n[13] Rather, it involves an examination of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and a decision as to whether, under the circumstances of the present case, the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to oust the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the complaint (Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 22 at paragraphs 13 and 14).\nB. Application of the Doctrine of Issue Estoppel [14] There comes a point in time when battles must be declared at end. The doctrine of issue estoppel is one of the devices that have been developed by the courts to determine the appropriate end to litigation. The doctrine has been extended, with some necessary modification, to administrative tribunals and officers.\n[15] In Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 S.C.R 460, the Supreme Court of Canada set out a two-staged approach to the application of the doctrine in the context of administrative tribunals. The first stage involves a three-part test. If all of the elements of the test are met, then one passes to the second stage, which involves an exercise of the Tribunal's discretion.\n[16] The three requirements which must be met in the first stage of the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel are as follows:\nthe same question is being decided in both proceedings; the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel is a final decision; and the parties or their privies to the two proceedings are the same (Danyluk, supra, at paragraph 25).\n[17] According to CN all three requirements are met in the present case.\n[18] I do not agree. In my view, only one of the three requirements for the application of issue estoppel is met and therefore, the doctrine does not apply to oust the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Mr. Smith's complaint.\n(i) The Same Questions Being Decided [19] CN argues that the issues before the arbitrator were virtually identical to the issues currently before the Tribunal.\n[20] Mr. Smith, on the other hand, argues that Arbitrator Picher's decision is limited to the issue of whether CN had a duty to accommodate Mr. Smith in his hometown of Terrace, B.C. In contrast, he argues, the complaint before the Tribunal extends to allegations regarding CN's conduct with respect to the accommodation efforts as a whole, as well as with respect to Mr. Smith's workers' compensation claim, and the decision to terminate the training program in Prince George.\n[21] In my view, it is clear that Arbitrator Picher's decision did, in fact, deal with more than just the accommodation of Mr. Smith in Terrace. He noted that once it became evident to the Company that Mr. Smith was willing to consider employment at a location other than Terrace, it identified the Traffic Coordinator's position in Prince George as a possibility. Arbitrator Picher stated that CN's efforts with respect to the Prince George position, as well as its efforts to bring him back as a train engineer in Terrace, constituted reasonable accommodation of Mr. Smith's disability.\n[22] Thus, in my view, Arbitrator Picher's decision did, in fact, deal with more than just the accommodation of Mr. Smith in Terrace.\n[23] However, in my view, Arbitrator Picher's decision did not deal with all of the issues raised in Mr. Smith's human rights complaint. Of necessity, his decision was limited to the events that took place up to the date of the hearing. The complaint, however, covers allegations of discrimination dating from March 26, 2001 and ongoing. Therefore, the complaint encompasses allegations based on circumstances arising after the arbitration hearing, such as the termination of the training program in Prince George and the alleged retaliation by CN (see Smith v. Canadian National Railway, Ruling on the Motion to Add a Party and Amend the Complaint 2005 CHRT 23).\n[24] Furthermore, there is some indication on the file that Mr. Smith may not have been able to put all of the issues and evidence regarding the accommodation options in Terrace before the arbitrator as a result of the decision of union counsel not to call him as a witness.\n[25] For these reasons, I find that the issues in the complaint proceedings are different from the issues that were addressed by the arbitrator.\n(ii) The Finality of the Decision [26] The Canada Labour Code provides that a decision of an arbitrator is final and binding on the parties, subject only to judicial review for jurisdictional error. Although, in the present case, judicial review proceedings were commenced, they were subsequently discontinued. Therefore, I find that the arbitrator's decision was final and this requirement of the test has been met.\n(iii) The Parties or their Privies are the Same [27] For the third requirement to be met, the parties or their privies must be the same. It is clear that in the present case, the parties in the two proceedings are not the same. Are their privies the same?\n[28] In order to be a privy, there must be a sufficient degree of mutual interest between the parties to make it fair to bind the parties to the second proceeding to the decision of the first (Danyluk, supra, at paragraph 60). Determinations about whether there is a sufficient degree of mutual interest such that the parties may be said to be privies of one and other must be made on a case-by-case basis (J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and A.W. Bryant, eds, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd ed., 1999 at p. 1088)).\n(iv) The Union and Mr. Smith as Privies [29] CN argues that because the collective bargaining regime supplants the relationship between the individual and the employer, Mr. Smith's interests can only be advanced through the grievance procedure, including arbitration. In addition, the union has a duty, under s. 37 of the Canada Labour Code, to fairly represent employees in the bargaining unit in the handling of their grievances.\n[30] As a result, CN argues, in the arbitration context, the interests of Mr. Smith and the union are identical.\n[31] CN states that support for its arguments may be found in previous decisions of this Tribunal in which the union and the grievor have been found to be privies for the purposes of issue estoppel (Thompson v. Rivtow Marine Ltd., [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 47; Parisien v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 23; and Desormeaux, supra).\n[32] I have examined the Tribunal decisions cited by CN and find that there is nothing in those decisions to suggest that in every case, there will be a privity of interest between the union and the grievor\/complainant. Rather, my reading of those decisions leads me to the conclusion that, in the particular circumstances of those cases, the Tribunal was prepared to accept that the union and the complainant were privies. As has been noted, this is a determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis.\n[33] Although the unionized employee's interests are advanced by and through the union, this does not necessarily mean that the interests of the union and the employee are always one and the same. Conflicts do arise between the interests of an employee and the bargaining unit with respect to the handling of a grievance (Re McRaeJackson [2004] C.I.R.B.D. No. 31).\n[34] The union is not required to respond to the interests of an employee in every case where to do so might be detrimental to the interests of the bargaining unit. The duty of fair representation requires only that the union make its decisions about the handling of a grievance in a fair and reasonable manner (Canadian Merchant Service Guild v. Gagnon, [1984] 1.S.C.R. 509).\n[35] Therefore, in my view, it is not possible to say that in all cases, there is a privity of interest between the union and the complainant. Each fact situation must be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine the extent to which a mutuality of interest exists.\n[36] In the present case, a review of the file suggests that although, generally speaking, the union and Mr. Smith shared common interests in the resolution of the grievance, there were several points of difference which, in my opinion, are significant enough to find that, in this particular case, the union and Mr. Smith are not privies. They are as follows:\n(1) In his affidavit, Mr. Smith deposes that his grievance hearing lasted two hours and that no witnesses were called. During a break, he asked that he be allowed to give evidence to counter CN's allegations. This request was refused by counsel for the union who said that he preferred the keep it simple principle.\n[37] Specifically, Mr. Smith alleges that he had relevant evidence relating to alternative employment possibilities within the company that went to the heart of the matter being decided by the arbitrator. He alleges that he was prevented from providing this important testimony.\n[38] CN does not take issue with Mr. Smith's assertions regarding his lack of testimony. However, it counters that Mr. Smith's affidavit evidence establishes that although he did not testify, he was given an opportunity to provide suggestions to counsel as to how to proceed with the presentation of his case. CN further suggests that Mr. Smith had a choice as to whether to follow union counsel's advice not to testify.\n[39] In my view, it is not clear that Mr. Smith did, in fact, have that choice. While the Memorandum of Agreement between CN and the union creating the arbitration procedure provides each party with the right to examine all witnesses and to give evidence at the hearing, it is the union and CN that are the parties to the dispute, not Mr. Smith (Memorandum of Agreement between CN and the Union creating the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration, dated September 1, 1971, paragraph 11). Moreover, it is the union that has carriage of the grievance, not the grievor (Re McRaeJackson, supra, at para. 40).\n[40] In my view, the fact that Mr. Smith was not able to testify during the arbitration hearing despite his wish to do so, is an important factor in determining whether there was a privity of interest between the union and Mr. Smith.\n(2) The second issue which militates against a finding of privity between Mr. Smith and the union concerns the application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.\n[41] On December 3, 2003, the union and Mr. Smith filed an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. On August 5, 2004, the application was discontinued. The Notice of Discontinuance was signed on behalf of Mr. Smith and the union by counsel for the union.\n[42] Although he was a party to the application, Mr. Smith deposes that he was not asked to consent to the discontinuance and that, had he been asked, he would have refused to consent. Mr. Smith states that when he was advised in May, 2004 that the union's lawyer had recommended discontinuing the application for judicial review, he wrote to union counsel expressing his concerns and objections. Notwithstanding Mr. Smith's objections, the decision was made to discontinue the judicial review application.\n[43] In my view, the two circumstances listed above demonstrate that there was an insufficient degree of mutual interest to consider the union and Mr. Smith privies in the present case.\n(v) The Commission and Mr. Smith as Privies [44] CN argues that the Tribunal's decisions in which it has held that the Commission is not a privy of the complainant are incorrect (see, for example: Rivtow Marine, supra; Parisien, supra; Desormeaux, supra; and Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. 2004 CHRT 8).\n[45] CN asserts that the Commission's status with respect to a complaint before the Tribunal, where the Commission is not the complainant, is merely derivative in nature. Therefore, the interests between the complainant and the Commission are so inextricably linked that the doctrine of issue estoppel should apply to bind the Commission to the previous decision.\n[46] I disagree with CN on this point. In my view, the submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission on this motion are apposite.\n[47] The Commission argues that to suggest that it is a privy of the complainant constitutes a fundamental misunderstanding of the legislative scheme that Parliament has established for the adjudication of human rights in Canada. Section 51 of the Act clearly sets out the role of the Commission as being distinct from that of the complainant.\n[48] The Commission represents the public interest before the Tribunal. In so doing, it must have regard to the nature of the complaint, but this does not preclude the Commission from taking a different position from that of the complainant if the public interest warrants this.\n[49] As the Tribunal stated in Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, supra, a finding that the Commission is a privy of a complainant would be contrary to the policy considerations underlying the Act. Such a conclusion would result in binding the Commission to proceedings to which it was not a party and would, therefore, prevent it from taking positions before this Tribunal that it believes are in the public interest.\n[50] Moreover, this is not a situation like the one in the recent ruling of this Tribunal on a motion in Paulette Toth v. Kitchener Aero Avionics 2005 CHRT 19. There, the Commission had chosen not to participate as a party for the purpose of determining whether the doctrine of issue estoppel applied. Here, the Commission has fully participated in the motion on this issue.\n[51] In support of its argument that the Commission should be considered a privy of the complainant, CN relies on the case of Re Bouten and Mynarski Park School District No. 5012 (1982), 139 D.L.R. (3d) 651 (Alta. Q.B.). In that case, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench found that the Alberta Human Rights Commission was a privy to the complainant.\n[52] Mr. Bouten was employed as teacher. When his employment was terminated, he launched an appeal to the Minister of Education alleging that the termination was discriminatory. He was unsuccessful in that forum and subsequently made a complaint to the Alberta Human Rights Commission. Before embarking on a hearing on the merits, the Board of Inquiry asked the Court to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata applied to oust the Board's jurisdiction over the complaint. The Court held that, in the circumstances of the case, the doctrine applied.\n[53] In my view, the reasoning in the Re Bouten case does not apply to the present case. While the Court of Queen's Bench found that the Alberta Human Rights Commission and the complainant shared the same interests in the resolution of the complaint, this Tribunal has noted that the interests of the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the complainant are distinct. The Commission does not represent the complainant; rather, the responsibility of the Commission is to represent the public interest (see for example: Desormeaux, supra, at para. 31).\n[54] Furthermore, it must be noted that in the Re Bouten case, Mr. Bouten, unlike Mr. Smith, was a party to the first proceeding in which discrimination in the termination of employment was alleged. In addition, Mr. Bouten was represented by his own counsel and testified in the first proceeding before a board of reference.\n[55] Such is not the case here. The union was a party to the arbitration, not Mr. Smith. Thus, in order to be consistent with the Re Bouten decision, CN would have had to argue that the union and the Commission are privies. This, it has not done. For these reasons, I am of the view that Re Bouten is not applicable to the present case.\n[56] Thus, I find that neither the parties nor their privies were the same in the two proceedings. As a result, the third component of the test for issue estoppel has not been met in the present case.\n(vi) Second Part of the Danyluk Test [57] Having found that two out of three of the requirements for the application of issue estoppel have not been met, I am of the view that there is no obligation for me to proceed to the second part of the Danyluk test.\nIII. CONCLUSION AND ORDER [58] I find that the doctrine of issue estoppel has no application in the present case and therefore, the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the complaint is not ousted.\n[59] Accordingly, CN's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by Karen A.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 23 2005\/06\/15\n[1] On February 28, 2002, Jim Smith filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that Canadian National Railway (CN) has been discriminating against him in employment on the basis of his disability. On May 19, 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the complaint to the Tribunal for further inquiry.\n[2] Mr. Smith is now asking that the complaint be amended to add allegations of retaliation against him by CN. He is also asking that the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia (the WCB) be added as a party to the complaint and that the complaint be amended to include allegations of retaliation and threats of retaliation by the WCB on behalf of CN.\n[3] CN does not oppose amending the complaint to add allegations of retaliation by CN.\nI. Background [4] Mr. Smith began working for CN in April, 1979. In November, 1997, Mr. Smith hurt his back while working. He filed a claim with the WCB. His claim was accepted and he received physiotherapy and other treatment for several months, returning to work in April, 1998.\n[5] Unfortunately, however, Mr. Smith's back condition worsened and in March, 1999, he was required to undergo surgery. For the remainder of 1999, Mr. Smith was off work, but participated in two work conditioning programs designed to build up his strength and mobility for an eventual return to work. These programs were sponsored by the WCB.\n[6] By January, 2000, a medical advisor for the WCB determined that Mr. Smith's condition had stabilized. The WCB placed certain restrictions on Mr. Smith's work activities, but stated that he could complete the graduated Return to Work Plan developed by the kinesiologist and orthopedic surgeon involved in his case.\n[7] The first Return to Work Plan in 2000 involved an attempt to gradually return Mr. Smith to his pre-injury position as a locomotive engineer. It was developed by a kinesiologist with CN. The WCB approved it and made recommendations to assist in making Mr. Smith's return to work a success. The WCB also provided him with short term disability benefits and health care benefits up to January 21, 2001.\n[8] The first Return to Work plan was unsuccessful. Mr. Smith was apparently experiencing ongoing back pain and spasms throughout the duration of the plan. He consulted with his physician, Dr. Appleton, about his ongoing back pain and spasms. Dr. Appleton recommended a neurological exam and indicated that Mr. Smith could not sit for greater than six hours.\n[9] The WCB referred Mr. Smith's medical file to a Board Medical Advisor for review. In a letter dated March 2, 2001, Ms. C. Arujo, a case manager for the WCB, stated that, based on the opinion provided by the WCB's medical advisor, Mr. Smith's pre-injury job was suitable.\n[10] As a result, effective January 21, 2001, the WCB terminated Mr. Smith's short term disability benefits. Ms. Arujo stated that vocational rehabilitation assistance was not necessary as Mr. Smith's pre-injury job was thought to be suitable. However, she stated that his file would be referred to the Disablity Awards Department for consideration of a permanent functional impairment award.\n[11] Mr. Smith appealed the WCB's decision that his pre-injury job was suitable and the decision to terminate his benefits to the Workers' Compensation Review Board.\n[12] In the meantime, CN developed several more Return to Work Plans in which Mr. Smith participated. They were, however, ultimately unsuccessful.\n[13] On February 28, 2002, Mr. Smith filed a complaint against CN with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination on the basis of disability.\n[14] In June, 2002, Mr. Smith's union advanced a grievance on his behalf alleging that the Company had violated the Collective Agreement by failing to accommodate Mr. Smith's disability.\n[15] On March 14, 2003, the Workers' Compensation Review Board allowed Mr. Smith's appeal of the WCB decision that his pre-injury job was suitable and that his benefits should be terminated. The Review Board held that employment as a locomotive engineer was unsuitable for Mr. Smith. The Review Board also ordered that he receive income continuity benefits from January 21, 2001 onward and a loss of earnings pension unless he was retrained for accommodated employment that would mitigate the loss of earnings. CN appealed this decision.\n[16] In April 2003, CN proposed that Mr. Smith train for a new position as a Traffic Coordinator in Prince George, British Columbia during the months of June and July, 2003. If he successfully completed the training program, Mr. Smith was to be offered the Traffic Coordinator position.\n[17] Mr. Smith began the training program in June, 2003. He completed a self-guided instruction component in Vancouver in June and then traveled to Prince George in July, 2003.\n[18] On July 4 and July 7, 2003, Mr. Todd McDonald, a vocational rehabilitation consultant with the WCB, communicated by fax and letter with Mr. Smith regarding his participation in the training program and his chances of receiving an offer for the position in Prince George.\n[19] In these communications, Mr. McDonald advised Mr. Smith of the WCB's view that the return to work plan in Prince George was appropriate, reasonable and necessary to assist Mr. Smith to return to work. He emphasized how important it was that Mr. Smith willingly participated in the Traffic Coordinator training program in Prince George notwithstanding the fact that he and his union had taken the position, in the grievance and human rights complaint, that he should be accommodated in Terrace.\n[20] Mr. McDonald also advised Mr. Smith that if he continued to insist upon a position in Terrace with the result that CN could not offer him the position in Prince George, then it might become necessary for the WCB to review the file to determine if any further vocational assistance should be offered.\n[21] On July 9, 2003, the union's grievance against CN was heard before Arbitrator Michel Picher. Arbitrator Picher rendered a decision on July 14, 2003, in which he dismissed the grievance. In his decision, Arbitrator Picher held that CN had fulfilled its responsibilities under the Collective Agreement and the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) to accommodate Mr. Smith.\n[22] In a file memorandum dated July 21, 2003, Todd McDonald of the WCB documented a telephone conversation with Tanya Gordon from CN about CN's concerns regarding the costs of the WCB's continued involvement in Mr. Smith's case should Mr. Smith be unsuccessful in obtaining the position in Prince George. According to the memorandum, Mr. McDonald told Ms. Gordon that given the current evidence on the file, Mr. Smith did not need further accommodation in terms of being able to lie down on the job or being allowed to leave work early.\n[23] In a letter dated July 29, 2003, CN informed Mr. Smith that the training program in Prince George had been terminated. The letter indicated that although Mr. Smith was capable of performing the duties of traffic coordinator in Prince George, he had yet to demonstrate any real commitment to learning the job.\n[24] The letter also stated that Mr. Smith had declined to follow instructions regarding how to correctly complete his diary entries and he appeared to have established a pattern of leaving his work area and\/or leaving his work unattended for non-work related reasons. The letter suggested that there were other objective observations by the transportation supervisors in Prince George that supported the termination of the program.\n[25] In a letter dated August 21, 2003 to Mr. Smith's union, Mr. McDonald from the WCB appeared to respond to accusations made by the union that he had threatened Mr. Smith in his earlier communications with him. Mr. McDonald asserted that if the union was using the word threaten in the sense identified by the Webster's dictionary as to give signs or warning of or to announce as intended or possible, then he may have threatened Mr. Smith. However, Mr. McDonald maintained that his communications with Mr. Smith were simply meant to advise the latter that his evident lack of commitment to the Return to Work Plan in Prince George could have potential consequences as they related to his Workers' Compensation claim.\n[26] In a letter dated October 1, 2003, Todd McDonald informed Mr. Smith of the WCB's decision that he would no longer be entitled to ongoing vocational rehabilitation assistance following the termination of the Return to Work plan. Mr. McDonald stated that in the WCB's view, the plan was appropriate, reasonable and necessary, took into account Mr. Smith's compensable restrictions and allowed for considerable flexibility in performance of the work. He stated that there were non-compensable barriers to Mr. Smith's return to work.\n[27] These barriers included Mr. Smith's unwillingness to fully commit himself to the position in Prince George as evidenced by his continuing investigation of avenues to stay in Terrace. In addition, the decision cited a demonstrated inability on Mr. Smith's part to complete full shifts in the absence of medical restrictions supporting this inability.\n[28] Mr. Smith appealed the WCB's decision of October 1, 2003 to terminate his vocational rehabilitation benefits. It was, however, subsequently upheld by a Workers' Compensation Review Officer on July 12, 2004.\n[29] In a decision dated March 22, 2004, the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board dismissed CN's appeal regarding Mr. Smith's ability to work as a locomotive engineer.\nA. The Parties' Positions [30] Mr. Smith alleges that CN retaliated against him for filing a human rights complaint by interfering with the adjudication of his WCB compensation claims. He further states that CN's early termination of the training program in Prince George constituted retaliation.\n[31] With respect to the WCB, Mr. Smith alleges that Todd McDonald threatened him that if he did not withdraw his grievance and his human rights complaint, his WCB benefits would be terminated. He further alleges that the termination of his WCB benefits following the cancellation of the training program in Prince George constituted retaliation on behalf of CN for the filing of a human rights complaint against CN.\n[32] While in no way admitting to any of the allegations, CN does not oppose that part of Mr. Smith's motion to amend the complaint that deals with allegations of retaliation by CN. However, CN opposes the amendment of the complaint to include allegations of retaliation and threats of retaliation against Mr. Smith by the WCB. CN adopts the submissions of the WCB on this part of the motion.\n[33] The WCB argues that the motion should be dismissed because there is no chance that the allegations in the amendment regarding the WCB could possibly succeed. Furthermore, the WCB asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the WCB, a body which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial government.\nB. Issues [34] The first issue to be determined in this motion is whether the WCB should be added as a party. If it is appropriate to add the WCB as a party, then the question becomes whether the complaint should be amended to add the allegations against the WCB.\n[35] However, in order to determine whether to add the WCB as a party, one must first look at the requirements of the Act with respect to complaints of retaliation and\/or threats of retaliation on behalf of a respondent.\n(i) Section 14.1 of the Act [36] Section 14.1 of the Act states that it is a discriminatory practice for a respondent or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the complainant or the victim. Although this Tribunal has dealt with cases of retaliation by respondents, it has not yet had occasion to deal with allegations of retaliation by a person acting on behalf of a person against whom a complaint has been filed.\n[37] In order to determine what is meant by acting on their behalf it is appropriate to first look at the legislative context of the provision.\n[38] Section 4 of the Act provides that a discriminatory practice, as described in sections 5 to 14.1, may be the subject of a complaint under Part III, and if the complaint is substantiated, the person who has engaged in the discriminatory practice may be subject to an order under sections 53 and 54 of the Act.\n[39] Section 65(1) of the Act stipulates that, subject to the due diligence provision under subsection 65(2), the acts or omissions of an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person in the course of his or her employment, shall be deemed to be the acts or omissions of that person, organization or association. Thus, for example, an organization may be held liable for the discriminatory conduct of its agent if it was performed in the course of employment. However, the agent does not, by operation of s. 65(1) alone, become personally liable for the discriminatory conduct.\n[40] By virtue of s. 4 of the Act, s. 65 applies to complaints of retaliation under s. 14.1 with the result that an organization may be held liable for the retaliatory actions of its agent. However, once again, the agent would not be personally liable for its retaliatory actions by operation of s. 65(1) alone.\n[41] Given that s. 65 applies to s. 14.1, the words acting on their behalf in section 14.1 must have another meaning than what is expressed in s. 65(1) of the Act. Otherwise, it would have been unnecessary to have added the words acting on behalf of in section 14.1.\n[42] One of the notable differences is that, unlike the liability established under s. 65 of the Act, the person found to be acting on behalf of a respondent for the purposes of retaliation is directly liable for a discriminatory practice and may be subject to an order under sections 53 and 54 of the Act.\n[43] It is possible to glean an additional meaning of the words acting on their behalf from the French version of the Act. The French text of s. 14.1 describes the person acting on behalf of the respondent as celle qui agit en son nom, that is, someone who is acting in the name of the respondent.\n[44] The French wording of s. 14.1 directs our attention to the second of two definitions provided by the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for on behalf of. There, the term is defined as meaning in the interests of a person or as a representative of.\n[45] Based on the preceding analysis of the legislative context of the provision, I conclude that in order to fall within the ambit of s. 14.1, the person who is acting on behalf of the respondent must be taking retaliatory action or making threats in the name of the respondent, or as a representative of the respondent. Further, the retaliatory action taken or threats made in the name of the respondent must be with respect to the filing of a human rights complaint against the respondent.\n[46] Since s. 14.1 opens up the possibility that the other person, in this case the WCB, may be subject to an order under s. 53 of the Act, that person must be added as a party to the complaint. What is the law on adding a party to the complaint?\nC. Adding a Party [47] This Tribunal has held that it has the discretion to add parties to an inquiry under the appropriate circumstances (oral ruling on October 2, 2002 by Chairperson Mactavish in Desormeaux v. OC Transpo (T701\/0602), referred to in Syndicat des employs d'excution de Qubec-tlphone v. Telus Comunications 2003 CHRT 31 at paragraphs 23 - 27). However, the Tribunal has also stated that the legislative context surrounding this discretionary power argues for a measure of restraint or caution in adding parties.\n[48] Under what circumstances is it appropriate to add a party? There are several Tribunal decisions which followed Desormeaux that provide some answers to this question.\n[49] For example, in the Telus case, the Panel declined to add the union as a party to the complaint. Among the circumstances that militated against the addition of the union as a party was the fact that nothing in the documentation submitted to the Panel indicated that the union or its members acted, or might have acted, in a discriminatory manner.\n[50] The Panel in Telus also noted that the addition of a new respondent at the stage of the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint, with no formal complaint having been brought against it, deprives the new respondent of the opportunity to present certain grounds of defense before the Commission.\n[51] In Brown v. NCC 2003 CHRT 43, Member Groarke granted a motion by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to add the Department of Public Works and Government Services as a respondent to the proceedings. He held that the addition of Public Works was necessary to provide a proper remedy to the complainant in the event that he was successful in establishing discrimination.\n[52] Thus, what emerges from the Tribunal's decisions to date on this issue is that caution should be exercised when adding a party. A new party should be added at the inquiry stage only if the addition of the party is necessary to properly dispose of the complaint and if there is a tenable basis for the allegations against the new party.\n[53] With regard to the latter point, I wish to be clear that the threshold for establishing that there is a tenable basis for the allegations against a new party is not high. The Tribunal will not engage in a substantive review of the merits of the allegations. However, the fact remains that there must be a tenable basis to the allegations involving the new party in order to justify exercising the Tribunal's discretion to add a party.\n[54] In the present case, I am prepared to accept that there may be some basis for the allegations that the WCB retaliated and threatened retaliation against Mr. Smith. However, I am not satisfied that there is a tenable basis to the allegations that the WCB took these actions on behalf of CN.\n[55] Mr. Smith asserts that the following material on the file supports the allegations that the WCB was acting on behalf of CN: (1) documentation of discussions between CN and the WCB regarding the costs of accommodating Mr. Smith; (2) documentation of meetings between the WCB and CN to discuss Mr. Smith's Return to Work and progress in the Prince George training program; (3) documentation regarding the WCB's agreement with CN's position on a number of issues.\n[56] In my view, this material does not establish a tenable basis for the allegation that the WCB's actions with regard to Mr. Smith were done in the name of CN.\n[57] Section 16 of the Workers' Compensation Act of British Columbia ( the WCA) provides the WCB with the discretion to take the measures and make the expenditures that it considers necessary in order to assist workers in getting back to work or to assist in lessening or removing a handicap resulting from a workplace injury or disease.\n[58] I think that it is appropriate to infer, based on the wording of the WCA, that in order to fulfill its mandate under section 16 to assist workers in getting back to work, the WCB may need to work with the accident employer.\n[59] In my view, the material to which Mr. Smith points in his file does no more than suggest the existence of a working relationship between officials in the WCB and CN regarding Mr. Smith's return to work. Evidence of a working relationship is not enough, however, to lend any plausibility to the allegation that the WCB was acting on behalf of CN, or in order to advance CN's alleged interest in retaliating against Mr. Smith for filing the complaint.\n[60] In other words, evidence of a working relationship between the two organizations does not raise an implicit assumption that the WCB was acting in the name of CN in allegedly retaliating or threatening retaliation against Mr. Smith.\n[61] There is a link that is missing here, which, in my view, is essential to the success of Mr. Smith's motion. That link consists of allegations and some evidence about the relationship or events that occurred between the WCB and CN which would explain why the WCB would act as CN's representative against Mr. Smith. I do not see anything in Mr. Smith's submissions or on the file that addresses this missing link.\n[62] Therefore, I find that there is no tenable basis to Mr. Smith's allegations that the WCB acted on behalf of CN. For this reason, I find that it is not appropriate to add the WCB as a party to the complaint. In my view, if it is not appropriate to add the WCB as a party, then Mr. Smith's request to amend the complaint must also be denied.\nII. Order [63] In view of the fact that CN does not oppose Mr. Smith's request to amend the complaint to add the allegations of retaliation by CN, this part of the motion is granted. The complaint should be so amended.\n[64] However, the request to add the WCB as a party and to amend the complaint to add the allegations of retaliation and threats of retaliation by the WCB on behalf of CN is denied.\nSigned by Karen A.

The Position of Translator\nIV. Decision.\nI. Introduction [1] In the fall of 2000, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging employment discrimination on the basis of his race, national or ethnic origin, and family status, in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, c. H\u20116.\nII. Facts [2] The Complainant, Daniel Kasongo Sadi, was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. After completing his secondary studies, he won a competition that enabled him to leave his country of birth and study at the Antwerp Maritime Academy in Belgium, where he spent three years studying marine navigation. Following these studies, he left Belgium and went to Algeria, where he obtained a Foreign Going Mate Certificate. He then worked in marine navigation for two years, but since he was unable to obtain his marine officer\u2019s service book, he had to reorient his career.\n[3] The Complainant worked as a musician for some time. Eventually, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees lent him assistance, which enabled him to leave the African continent. He was offered the opportunity to go to Australia, the United States or Canada. Since he had known a Canadian instructor in Algeria, he chose Canada. He arrived in Montreal on October 14, 1984, and became a Canadian citizen in 1988.\n[4] Once in Canada, the Complainant decided to return to school and choose a new career. He enrolled at Concordia University in Montreal, where he obtained a Bachelor of French Studies with a specialization in French Language Instruction. He had obtained a certificate in adult French Second Language Instruction (adult FSL instruction) from the same university in 1990.\n[5] After obtaining his Bachelor\u2019s degree, the Complainant worked as an orientation officer on a volunteer basis for Services Catholiques pour Immigrants teaching French to new immigrants. The organization worked with Immigration-Qu\u00e9bec at the time. The Complainant testified that this work inspired him to specialize in adult FSL instruction.\n[6] The Complainant\u2019s next job, which he held from 1991 to 1998, was with the Commission des \u00c9coles Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al. He was an adult FSL instructor with that school board. In 1990\u201191, the Complainant began a Master\u2019s in Linguistics at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al with a special option in French Instruction. He took three courses but then abandoned the program. On his complaint form, the Complainant stated that he had a [Translation] Master\u2019s degree in Linguistics with a specialization in French Instruction. Based on his curriculum vitae and his testimony, this is inaccurate. When cross\u2011examined regarding the inconsistency, the Complainant embroiled himself in rather unconvincing explanations. He admits that this is a mistake and that there are other mistakes in his complaint form, a fact that obviously casts doubt on the document\u2019s reliability.\n[7] During the same period, the Complainant worked as a journalist for Radio Centre-Ville in Montreal and as an editor and journalist for a newspaper called Alternatives, for which he filed reports from the Great Lakes region of Africa, and for a magazine called Afrique. He also produced 24 programs for \u00c9chos d\u2019Afrique.\n[8] Other positions held by the Complainant during his stay in Montreal were that of director of public relations and project manager of Safari Maison Interculturelle (an intercultural centre established to welcome immigrants) and that of executive director of the Centre Culturel Africain.\n[9] In 1997, the Complainant returned to the Congo (Zaire) where for roughly six months he was the national director of the Radio-t\u00e9l\u00e9vision Nationale du Congo. He then returned to Canada to be with his wife, who was pregnant with their second child. In May 1998, he decided to leave for Western Canada to find work. His intention was to go to British Columbia, but his car broke down in Regina, Saskatchewan, where he decided to settle and look for employment.\n[10] The Complainant\u2019s first job in Saskatchewan was with the Conseil Culturel Fransaskois.[1] Shortly thereafter, he obtained a position with the Language Institute of the University of Regina as an adult FSL instructor. He began this job on a part-time basis during the summer, teaching FSL to CBC technicians.\n[11] In September 1998, the Complainant taught three French courses at the Language Institute. The Institute also hired him to give French courses to public servants, a judge, and a senior University official.\n[12] In May 1999, he began a new part\u2011time job at the CBC on the weekends. In the summer of that year, he left the Institute and began working for the CBC full-time. During the same period, he taught FSL to adults at the RCMP Training Academy.\n[13] Since November 2002, the Complainant has been working for the Canada School of Public Service in Ottawa, where he teaches FSL to federal public servants.\n[14] In his complaint form, the Complainant alleges that he was discriminated against based on his race, his national or ethnic origin and his family status, in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[15] Specifically, he claims that in late July 1999, he responded to a job posting for an FSL instructor with the Farm Credit Corporation, which is now called Farm Credit Canada (the Respondent). The position was advertised in the Regina newspapers. The Complainant allegedly sent a resume and covering letter to Marie-France Kenny, the Respondent\u2019s Director of Official Languages and Translation. In his complaint form, he also claims he submitted his resume during the year 2000 for a position of employment equity officer and for a translator position. His applications for all three positions were unsuccessful.\n[16] The complaint form also alludes to nepotism in the Respondent\u2019s recruitment process. The Complainant alleges that unless one is a member of [Translation] one of the important Fransaskois families, it is difficult to obtain a position with the Respondent. At the hearing, the Complainant adduced no conclusive evidence, only impressions, in support of this allegation. No witness was called to corroborate the Complainant\u2019s perceptions in this regard. I wish to emphasize that neither impressions nor impressionistic evidence are sufficient to establish discrimination. Actual evidence is required. In view of the evidence before me, I have no reason to believe that the Respondent practiced the nepotism to which the Complainant refers, nor do I have evidence that members of important Fransaskois families are the only ones to be favoured in hiring. In light of this absence of evidence, I will not take those allegations into account in this decision.\n[17] Before addressing in greater detail the complaints regarding the different positions applied for, we should ascertain which legal principles apply to the case.\nIII. Legal Analysis [18] Section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ a person on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Race, colour, and national or ethnic origin are all prohibited grounds.\n[19] The initial burden of proof in cases such as this lies with the Complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 at 1618; Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; and Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04).\n[20] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202 at 208; Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536 at para. 28.) Thus, the question is whether there is evidence which would, in and of itself, establish on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant was discriminated against.\n[21] In Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd, 2004 FCA 204, the Federal Court of Appeal specified, at para. 22, that the Tribunal must not take account of the respondent\u2019s answer before concluding that a prima facie case has been established. The Court added that this element has no role in determining whether the complainant has met his or her burden of proof.\n[22] In the employment context, a prima facie case has been held to require evidence of the following elements:\nthe complainant was qualified for the particular employment; the complainant was not hired; someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (i.e. race, colour, etc.) subsequently obtained the position (Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 at para. 8918.)\n[23] This criterion has been adapted to situations in which the complainant was not hired and in which the respondent continued to search for an appropriate candidate. In such cases, the following elements must be established in order to make out a prima facie case:\nthe complainant belongs to one of the groups which are subject to discrimination under the Act, e.g. religious, disabled or visible minority groups; the complainant applied and was qualified for the job the employer wished to fill; although qualified, the complainant was rejected; and thereafter the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant\u2019s qualifications (Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 at 1618).\n[24] In Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, Chairperson Anne Mactavish, as she then was, noted:\nWhile both the Shakes and the Israeli tests serve as useful guides, neither test should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case: rather the circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate. Ultimately, the question will be whether [the complainant] has satisfied the O'Malley test, that is: if believed, is the evidence before [the Tribunal] complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in [the complainant\u2019s] favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent?\n[25] Once a prima facie case has been made out, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent, who must provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of. If he provides a reasonable explanation of what would otherwise be discriminatory conduct, the burden will shift back to the complainant, who will have to show that the explanation was a pretext and that the true motivation behind the respondent\u2019s acts was discriminatory.\n[26] The jurisprudence recognizes that it is difficult to prove allegations of discrimination by means of direct evidence. As mentioned in Basi: Discrimination on the grounds of race or color are frequently practised in a very subtle manner. Overt discrimination on these grounds is not present in every discriminatory situation or occurrence. (Basi, supra, at para. D\/5038.) It is therefore the Tribunal\u2019s task to take account of all the circumstances and ascertain whether what has been described as the subtle scent of discrimination is present. (Premakumar, at para. 79.)\n[27] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities: An inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses. (Premakumar, at para. 81.) It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if race, colour or national or ethnic origin were factors in the decision not to hire. (Premakumar, at para. 82; Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, at para. D\/15.) However, it should be specified that the circumstantial evidence cannot merely be consistent with an inference of discrimination; it must also be inconsistent with other possibilities.\n[28] Indeed, discrimination has its own set of difficulties. Foremost among these, without question, is that the same set of circumstances may be open to a variety of interpretations. In Brooks v. Canada (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), 2004 CHRT 36, my colleague Paul Groarke noted as follows at para. 107:\nIt could be said that the act of discrimination lies in differentiation. The problem is that this differentiation does not exist independently of the actions of the parties. It must be inferred. It follows that here is an element of judgement in any assessment of the circumstances that give rise to a complaint of discrimination.\n[29] The Tribunal must be careful in assessing evidence, which is often impressionistic. In Shakes, supra, the Board of Inquiry recognized the limits of this kind of evidence when it cited Professor Borins in Kennedy v. Mohawk College (1973):\nIt should also be added that the Board must view the conduct complained of in an objective manner and not from the subjective viewpoint of the person alleging discrimination whose interpretation of the impugned conduct may well be distorted because of innate personality characteristics, such as a high degree of sensitivity or defensiveness.\n[30] As the Tribunal stated in Brooks, supra, the use of the word innate in this excerpt is unfortunate. However, the point that Professor Borins was trying to make is important: a Tribunal should be cautious in relying on the perceptions of the parties.\n[31] Those are the principles that I must apply in the instant case. The complaint form, signed by the Complainant on September 24, 2000, alleges discrimination with regard to three positions:\nadult FSL instructor diversity advisor translator\n[32] The position of bilingual communications officer is not mentioned on the complaint form, but was raised by the Complainant in his disclosure and at the hearing. Since the Respondent was notified of the Complainant\u2019s intent to raise the question when he filed his disclosure on September 8, 2004, and since there is no resulting prejudice to the Respondent, the Tribunal intends to consider the facts surrounding this question in its decision.\nA. The Position of FSL Instructor [33] On July 31, 1999, the Respondent advertised an employment offer in The Leader Post, an English\u2011language Regina newspaper, and in the French\u2011language weekly L'Eau Vive, for a position of FSL instructor. According to the advertisement, the incumbent would provide group and private instruction to students of different levels. The position required the experience needed to customize training programs for students. The advertisement also required a good knowledge of the Programme de Base de Fran\u00e7ais au Travail (PBFT). The candidate was required to have a B.Ed. degree as well as excellent command of written and oral French, and have broad experience in teaching adults. The position was offered on a contractual basis and the incumbent was to be considered self-employed. Interested persons were invited to send [their] resume by August 6, 1999, to Marie-France Kenny who was then Director, Official Languages and Translation. At the hearing, Ms. Kenny was the [Translation] Director, Official Languages \/ Cultural Practices Business Partner, Human Resources.\n[34] Ms. Kenny is the Respondent\u2019s Manager of Language Training. In this capacity, she prepared the material used to select the candidates, except the written French test, which is the Respondent\u2019s standard test. She is responsible for preparing the interview guide and the questions that are asked.\n[35] Louise Beaudoin, Ms. Kenny\u2019s Administrative Assistant, testified that a dozen people applied for the position. Ms. Kenny said that once she had the candidates\u2019 resumes, she proceeded to select the candidates who would be invited to take the written test. Ms. Beaudoin was the person who contacted them to invite them to the test. Ms. Kenny corrected the test papers.\n[36] Since the Complainant felt he was qualified for the position, he decided to apply. The evidence does show that the Complainant has solid FSL instruction experience.\n[37] The Complainant claims to have gone to the Respondent\u2019s offices in person to submit an envelope that was addressed to Ms. Kenny and contained his resume and a cover letter. The cover letter was never tendered in evidence. In fact, no cover letter, for any of the Respondent\u2019s positions for which the Complainant claims to have applied, was ever produced in evidence. I am not satisfied with the Complainant\u2019s explanations regarding the absence of these letters, and I have come to doubt whether they existed.\n[38] The Complainant states that he handed over the envelope at the reception desk. Fran\u00e7ois Magnin, the receptionist that day, said that only a resume \u2014 no cover letter or envelope \u2014 was submitted. He added that if he had been handed an envelope, he would have stamped it Reception\/R\u00e9ception Received\/Re\u00e7u without opening it. In this case, the stamp is on the copy of the Complainant\u2019s resume, which means, according to Mr. Magnin, that the document was handed to him without an envelope. He also said that if the Complainant had told him that the document should be given to a specific person, he would have given it to that person. I have no reason to doubt Mr. Magnin\u2019s testimony on this subject. He appeared to be a credible, reliable and impartial witness since his conduct is not directly in issue in this case. Given these circumstances, I accept his testimony when it contradicts the Complainant\u2019s.\n[39] The Complainant claims he told Mr. Magnin he was there about the position advertised in L\u2019Eau Vive and that Mr. Magnin replied [Translation] Yes, the position advertised by Marie\u2011France Kenny. However, under cross-examination, he admitted that this was the first time he made reference to this alleged conversation with Mr. Magnin. I prefer Mr. Magnin\u2019s testimony to the Complainant\u2019s.\n[40] On August 4, 1999, a few days after he submitted his application, the Complainant received a letter from the Respondent. The letter is signed by intern Tenille Nashiem on behalf of Misha Fafard, who was a staffing and employment relations assistant with the Human Resources Division. It states that there are no positions with the Respondent which match the Complainant\u2019s profile, and informs the Complainant that his resume will be kept on file for six months. This, says Ms. Fafard, is the Respondent\u2019s practice when a resume is received without any indication of the position for which the person has applied.\n[41] On or about August 9, after receiving the letter, the Complainant allegedly phoned the Respondent and asked to speak with Ms. Kenny to find out what was wrong. He spoke first with Ms. Fafard, who explained that she had received his resume, which had been placed in the file containing resumes sent without a cover letter as there had been no indication of the position for which the author of the letter was applying. When the Complainant said he was applying for the position of French instructor, Ms. Fafard told him she was unaware of the posting because the Human Resources Division was not involved in the staffing, which falls under Ms. Kenny\u2019s responsibility. Thus, Ms. Fafard transferred the call to Ms. Kenny. Ms. Fafard adds that she went to look for the Complainant\u2019s resume and sent it to Ms. Kenny.\n[42] Ms. Kenny says that she realized, while speaking with the Complainant, that he had the basic qualifications required to apply for the position. She told him that she would get his resume from the Human Resources Division even though the deadline for the conditions had expired.\n[43] The Complainant was invited to the written test and was then invited in for an interview.\n[44] The Complainant claims that he got the top score on the written test. This is confirmed by Nicole Bussi\u00e8res, a member of the interview committee. However, Ms. Bussi\u00e8res adds that all the candidates performed quite well on the written test and that the ranking was ultimately of little importance because the four best performers were selected for an interview. At the hearing, Ms. Kenny specified that the results on the written test and the interview were not cumulative.\n[45] The Complainant was asked to attend an interview for the position of instructor on August 19, 1999 at 9:00 a.m. The three other candidates invited to an interview were Lorraine Lalibert\u00e9, C\u00e9line Merriman and Nicole Lemelin-Sarny.\n[46] Ms. Kenny attended the interview along with Nicole Bussi\u00e8res, one of the Respondent\u2019s FSL instructors. Ms. Bussi\u00e8res is self\u2011employed; she is not a Respondent\u2019s employee. The interview was the first time the Complainant met with the two people in question, though he did speak with Ms. Kenny on the telephone once earlier. The interview process was the same with all the candidates.\n[47] Ms. Kenny testified that her impression of the Complainant\u2019s interview was very good. She adds that she found the interview [Translation] engrossing. She says that she found the Complainant [Translation] dynamic and creative. She had told Ms. Bussi\u00e8res that it would not matter if the three other candidates were not suitable because the Complainant was an excellent candidate. Nicole Bussi\u00e8res says she found the Complainant a [Translation] very interesting candidate.\n[48] Ms. Kenny and Ms. Bussi\u00e8res claim to have discussed the candidates between interviews. Before Ms. Lemelin-Sarny was interviewed, the choice was still Mr. Kasongo. After she was interviewed, the choice was between her and the Complainant. Ms. Kenny testified that she was leaning toward the Complainant, but that they finally opted for Ms. Lemelin-Sarny.\n[49] Ms. Bussi\u00e8res states that both candidates ranked equally on the interview. The factor that tipped the balance in favour of Ms. Lemelin-Sarny is that she taught two of Ms. Bussi\u00e8res\u2019 students during a one\u2011week immersion course and the students strongly recommended her. The Complainant had also participated in the course, but he did so as part of a cultural activity, not as an instructor. Ms. Bussi\u00e8res added that if Ms. Lemelin\u2011Sarny had turned down the position, Ms. Kenny and she were in agreement that it would be offered to the Complainant.\n[50] According to Ms. Kenny, the Complainant could most certainly have adapted to the Respondent\u2019s environment. However, her perception during the interview was that Ms. Lemelin\u2011Sarny already had the whole package. In Ms. Kenny\u2019s words, she would [Translation] need less guidance. She added that Ms. Lemelin-Sarny had placed a particular emphasis on her teaching experience in the interview, while the Complainant showed that he was very creative but spoke about different experiences. She concluded that she could have worked with either candidate, but that she went along with Ms. Bussi\u00e8res\u2019 choice because Ms. Bussi\u00e8res was the one who would be working with the successful applicant.\n[51] A few days after the interview, Ms. Kenny phoned the Complainant to inform him that the FSL instructor position had been given to someone else.\n[52] Let us now apply the legal principles described above to these facts. The Complainant has established that he belongs to a group that can be subject to racial discrimination. He has also shown that he had the academic qualifications and the experience necessary to meet the requirements of the FSL instructor position. The facts have shown that another person with similar qualifications was awarded the position and that this person is not black. Thus, the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. Indeed, the Respondent has admitted to this finding and no additional time need be spent on it.\n[53] Since the Complainant has discharged the burden of establishing a prima facie case, the burden now shifts to the Respondent, who must provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of.\n[54] Under the Respondent\u2019s selection process, the candidates were to submit their resumes to Marie\u2011France Kenny no later than August 6, 1999. Fran\u00e7ois Magnin testified that he received the resume from the Complainant without an envelope, and, more importantly, without a cover letter. The Complainant says it is his practice to include a cover letter with his resume, and, in support of this contention, he tendered copies of cover letters prepared under other circumstances. However, the Complainant was never able to present a cover letter for the position of FSL instructor, and this inability leads me to believe the letter never existed.\n[55] Mr. Magnin, the receptionist, testified that the Complainant did not tell him he was applying for a specific position. Consequently, in keeping with the Respondent\u2019s practice, the Complainant\u2019s resume was remitted to Human Resources, where it was placed in the general file so that it could be retained for six months. Once again, in accordance with the Respondent\u2019s practice, a form letter was sent to the Complainant on August 4, 1999, informing him that there was no position matching his skills. The Complainant interpreted the letter as an attempt to exclude him from the process, but the evidence showed that when the Respondent receives a resume and the writer of the letter does not indicate which position he is applying for, the practice is to send him a standard letter of the kind sent to the Complainant on August 4, 1999.\n[56] After receiving the letter, the Complainant phoned the Respondent and spoke with Ms. Fafard, who explained that his resume had been placed in the file containing applications sent without a cover letter. After learning that the Complainant was applying for the position of FSL instructor, the call was transferred to Ms. Kenny.\n[57] Since Ms. Kenny was satisfied that the Complainant had the basic qualifications for the position, she invited him to the written test, followed by the interview, and she did so even though the deadline for submitting applications had passed.\n[58] In light of these facts, I cannot conclude that the Respondent intended to exclude the Complainant from the selection process at this stage. The Respondent provided a reasonable explanation of the conduct complained of. In fact, I find that the Complainant is largely, if not totally, responsible for the imbroglio that followed the submission of his resume for this position. If he had followed the instructions that were clearly set out in the vacancy announcement, and had filed his resume with Ms. Kenny as requested, he would have avoided a lot of frustration.\n[59] Twelve candidates, including the Complainant, were invited to take the French test. Four candidates, including the Complainant, were selected for an interview on August 19, 1999. Once again, since the Complainant got through these phases without difficulty, there is no evidence that the Respondent tried to exclude him from the position, by reason of his race or his ethnic origin, at this stage.\n[60] Marie-France Kenny and Nicole Bussi\u00e8res were responsible for interviewing the candidates who made it to the interview phase. Nothing worthy of being called notes was produced at the hearing, so we must rely on the participants\u2019 memory to understand what happened during the interviews.\n[61] Two candidates were quickly ruled out at the interview stage. Both Ms. Kenny and Ms. Bussi\u00e8res testified that they were very impressed with the Complainant\u2019s interview. Ms. Kenny added that she knew, from the moment he was being interviewed, that they had found an acceptable candidate no matter what else might happen. However, Nicole Lemelin-Sarny, the last candidate, impressed them just as much. Ms. Bussi\u00e8res says both candidates were equal in standing but that, in her mind, the balance tipped in Ms. Lemelin-Sarny\u2019s favour because of the positive comments made by two students who had taken an immersion course at the University of Regina with the candidate.\n[62] As for Ms. Kenny, she adds that she clicked better with the Complainant, but felt that Ms. Lemelin-Sarny had more experience teaching Anglophones, while the Complainant\u2019s experience was primarily with allophones (speakers of foreign languages). I must admit that I find Ms. Kenny\u2019s conclusion on this matter puzzling to say the least. She never explained how this experience with allophones was so different from experience with Anglophones.\n[63] Ms. Kenny specifies that Ms. Lemelin-Sarny seemed more mature, poised and structured in her interview and gave the impression she would need less guidance than the Complainant. Lastly, she says that Ms. Lemelin\u2011Sarny spoke only about her teaching experience in the interview, while the Complainant spoke about a number of subjects.\n[64] Ms. Kenny adds that she deferred to Ms. Bussi\u00e8res in the final analysis because she was the one who would have to work with the successful candidate. They decided to offer the position to Ms. Lemelin-Sarny.\n[65] An analysis of both candidates\u2019 resumes shows that the Complainant had greater experience than Ms. Lemelin\u2011Sarny teaching English as a second language to adults. Her experience consisted mainly of teaching in the public school sector.\n[66] However, I must point out that it is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to review the merits of the Respondent\u2019s choice and determine whether it was correct. There is a subjective element in every hiring process. The fact that the Respondent used subjective criteria in assessing the candidates, and that it may have erred in applying those criteria, does not in itself render its decision subject to attack on the basis that it is discriminatory. (See Folch v. Canadian Airlines International (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261 at D\/303).\n[67] The evidence showed which criteria were used to evaluate the candidates as well as the specific reasons it was felt the Complainant should not be the successful candidate. It is not my function to agree or disagree with the final choice, provided the choice was not made based on discriminatory grounds.\n[68] In view of the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that the Respondent has discharged its burden with regard to this position, and has provided a reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of. The Respondent was able to explain the reasons that caused it to select Ms. Lemelin-Sarny instead of the Complainant as the incumbent, and nothing about those explanations suggests that the Complainant\u2019s race or ethnic origin were a consideration.\n[69] Consequently, the burden shifts back to the Complainant, who must now show that the Respondent\u2019s explanation was a pretext and that the true motivation behind the Respondent\u2019s actions was discriminatory.\n[70] In Folch, supra, the Tribunal thought it important to note that [w]here subjective criteria are used, it may be necessary to scrutinize the hiring decisions more carefully to ensure that subjective assessments are not being used to mask discrimination.\n[71] It is true that discrimination is often invisible, and that people who discriminate generally do not realize they are doing so. This does not mean that others are unaware of the discrimination, however. Based on all the circumstances, can a subtle scent of discrimination, as the Tribunal so aptly described in Basi, supra, be shown to exist? Does the Complainant\u2019s testimony provide evidence of this scent? In my opinion, it does not. Other than impressions, perceptions and the fact that he was convinced he was the best candidate, the Complainant has provided no evidence that the decision was based on considerations of race or colour. Nor does the context of the competition and the interviews provide any evidence that race was a factor that the Respondent considered in its decision.\n[72] There is no evidence in support of the Complainant\u2019s contention that the question of race or ethnic origin was taken into consideration in the selection process. The race and ethic origin of the Complainant were not in the background of the selection process as they were in Brooks (supra, at para. 119).\n[73] In light of the foregoing, I find that the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination in the hiring process for the position of FSL instructor are unfounded.\nB. The Position of Bilingual Communications Officer [74] In August 1999, the Respondent advertised a vacancy for a bilingual communications officer. The deadline for submitting applications was set at August 6, 1999. The position was initially advertised only in Saskatchewan. Since no satisfactory candidate was found, the position was advertised again, nationally, on October 7, 1999.\n[75] The incumbent for the position of bilingual communications officer is a member of a team responsible for internal communications, media relations, speech writing and annual report preparation. The position requires an intimate understanding of the Canadian media and a degree in Journalism or Arts. Fluency in both written and oral English and French is essential; in fact, based on the Respondent\u2019s classification system, the position requires a professional level of written and oral English and French.\n[76] The position of bilingual communications officer was not included in the Complainant\u2019s original complaint. At the hearing, it was said that the Commission decided not to pursue the complaint because the Investigator determined that the Complainant did not appear qualified for the position. The Investigator was not called to testify and the bases of her findings were not tendered in evidence.\n[77] I would note, however, that on August 25, 2000, the Commission sent the Complainant a letter along with his complaint form. Among other things, the letter informed him that the Commission did not accept his allegations regarding the position. At the hearing, the Complainant said he had never seen the letter before. He explained that he decided in July 2000 to resettle in Belgium, and he did resettle there for a time. Yet, on September 24, 2000, he signed the complaint form enclosed with the letter, without asking that it be amended by adding the position of bilingual communications officer. I must admit that I have trouble believing the Complainant\u2019s statement that he never received or saw the Commission\u2019s letter prior to the hearing, considering that he does admit receiving and signing the complaint form enclosed with the letter. I do not accept the Complainant\u2019s testimony on this point.\n[78] I note other inconsistencies in the Complainant\u2019s testimony regarding this allegation. In the course of interviews with the Canadian Human Rights Commission Investigator, the Complainant contended the position was initially announced as a French communications officer position and was only categorized as a bilingual communications officer position when the second competition was announced. At the hearing, the Complainant admitted that this information provided to the Commission was incorrect.\n[79] Despite these facts which are unfavourable to the Complainant\u2019s credibility, I have decided, as explained above, to consider his complaint regarding the position in issue.\n[80] According to the Complainant, Ms. Kenny followed the Complainant in the hallway after his interview for the FSL instructor position on August 19, 1999. She allegedly asked him if he was interested in the position of Bilingual Communications Officer; if his application for the instructor position was not successful, she could forward his resume to Pam Bristol, who was in charge of the bilingual communications officer position. The Complainant says he already knew about the position from the want ads, and that he had, in fact, submitted his application for the position. However, he says he did not give this information to Ms. Kenny because he feared it would interfere with his application for the position of FSL instructor. He says he accepted Ms. Kenny\u2019s offer with misgivings as he was [Translation] under the impression that he was being pushed out of the competition for the position of instructor, though he nuanced this statement somewhat under cross-examination.\n[81] According to Ms. Kenny, this conversation did not occur on the date the Complainant claims it did. Rather, she says it occurred a few days later, when Ms. Kenny phoned the Complainant and notified him that his application for the teaching position had not been successful. Ms. Kenny adds that she also told the Complainant that the Respondent was looking for a bilingual communications officer, and asked him if she could send his resume to the person responsible for staffing that position. Ms. Kenny went to see Pam Bristol and handed the resume to her in person. Ms. Bristol confirmed this at the hearing.\n[82] The Complainant was invited to take the oral and written tests for the position.\n[83] The circumstances surrounding the position of bilingual communications officer trigger the criteria in Israeli, which apply where the complainant was not hired and where the respondent continued to look for a candidate. In order to establish a prima facie case in these situations, the Complainant must show that he belongs to one of the groups subject to discrimination under the Act. In this instance, we need not give this criterion lengthy consideration; the Complainant has shown that he met the criterion. Despite certain inconsistencies in the evidence, I also find that the Complainant applied for the position.\n[84] As noted, the Tribunal must not take the respondent\u2019s answer into account at the stage where it is determining whether a prima facie case has been made out: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd, supra. Consequently, since the Complainant was invited to take the oral and written tests, I find that, for the purpose of establishing a prima facie case, he qualified for the position which the employer wished to fill, and that his application was rejected. The employer then continued to look for candidates with the complainant\u2019s qualifications.\n[85] Since a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the burden shifts to the Respondent, who must provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of. In the present case, Ms. Bristol and the selection committee met with the Complainant. According to Ms. Bristol, the Complainant had an impressive portfolio of articles written in French. Ms. Bristol says he had an agreeable personality and adds that the interview went well. Consequently, the Complainant went on to the next stage in the selection process: the English communication test. Ms. Bristol specifies that the position requires the incumbent to write documents primarily in English, because the client base is primarily English-speaking. Ms. Bristol is the person who corrected the Complainant\u2019s test. Upon correcting the test, she claims to have realized that while the Complainant\u2019s English skills were good, they were not at the level required for the position. His application was therefore rejected.\n[86] At the hearing, the Complainant produced a document which was not disclosed earlier and which he said he found in a box of documents that he had just received from Saskatchewan. The document records an exchange of e-mails between Pam Bristol and the Complainant. In his e\u2011mail message, the Complainant inquires about the status of his application for the position of bilingual communications officer. Pam Bristol replies on September 8, 1999, notifying him that the Respondent is in the process of checking the other candidate\u2019s references. She says the other candidate did better on the oral and written English tests and that the position requires the incumbent to work in English 70% of the time and that English skills are therefore very important.\n[87] A few days later, Ms. Bristol contacted the Complainant again, this time by telephone, to inform him that his application for the position had not been retained. She said that his English writing skills were not of publishable quality. She added that the Complainant appeared disappointed but unsurprised with the results. Since the other candidate\u2019s application was rejected after the reference check as well, the position was advertised again.\n[88] After the second vacancy announcement, the position was offered to Yves Breton. Mr. Breton took the same oral and written tests as the Complainant.\n[89] I find that the Respondent has given a reasonable explanation of the reasons it decided to reject the Complainant\u2019s application. Ms. Bristol was of the opinion that the Complainant\u2019s oral and written English skills did not meet the standards required of the position. Moreover, the evidence submitted at the hearing shows that the Canadian Human Rights Commission was of the same opinion and that when the Complainant signed his complaint form without requiring an amendment, he was acknowledging the merits of the decision.\n[90] Consequently, the burden shifts back to the Complainant. He must show that the Respondent\u2019s explanation was a pretext and that the true motivation behind the Respondent\u2019s actions was discriminatory. The Complainant adduced no evidence in this regard. In fact, the only relevant evidence is that of Pam Bristol, who asserts that when she informed the Complainant of her decision, he seemed disappointed but not surprised about the outcome. The Complainant did not contradict this in his evidence or in his cross-examination of Ms. Bristol.\n[91] The Complainant\u2019s allegations, to the effect that he was discriminated against when the position of Bilingual Communications Officer was staffed, are dismissed.\nC. The Position of Diversity Advisor [92] An advertisement was placed in the May 11, 2000, issue of L\u2019Eau vive, to announce a vacancy for the position of diversity advisor. The diversity manager was seeking someone to assist in the planning, implementation and evaluation of the Respondent\u2019s initiatives in this area. The candidates were to have a university degree in human resources or a related field and at least three years of solid experience in diversity, employment equity and project management in the workplace. The applications and resumes were to be submitted to Human Resources by May 19, 2000.\n[93] Martine No\u00ebl-Maw, the Diversity Manager, testified by affidavit. In her affidavit, she specified that she was looking for a qualified person with experience in diversity and equity because the position was short\u2011term and she absolutely needed someone with knowledge of the relevant laws.\n[94] The Complainant said he applied for the position. On June 30, 2000, he received a letter signed by Pat Seidler, Administrative Assistant to the Vice President, Human Resources, on behalf of Misha Fafard. The letter states that, for the moment, there [Translation] are no positions available that match your skills and experience. Ms. Fafard states that she was not aware of this letter, but adds that the Human Resources office automatically sends this form letter in the event of unsolicited resumes.\n[95] The Complainant states that this was roughly the time that he began recording his conversations with representatives of the Respondent. He says he did this because he felt there were [Translation] readily noticeable irregularities that suggest that marginalization was occurring. In his view, each time he applied for a position, he was told either that the resume did not get to the person in charge or that it had been lost in the bureaucratic machinery. However, based on the evidence, I cannot find that the [Translation] readily noticeable irregularities to which the Complainant refers exist. On the contrary, the circumstances as a whole tend to show that the Complainant has an improper understanding of the process for staffing the Respondent\u2019s position and, as the facts have demonstrated, that the Complainant tends to exaggerate the facts. I admit that the Complainant was going through a difficult period, but nothing in the evidence presented enables me to conclude that discrimination was involved.\n[96] After receiving the letter of June 30, 2000, the Complainant phoned Ms. Fafard. The first person he spoke to was receptionist Laurie Cinq-Mars, whom he asked whether she had given his resume to Ms. Fafard. In the recording of this conversation, which was played at the hearing, Ms. Cinq\u2011Mars acknowledged that she received the resume and said she gave it to someone she did not identify. She added that if a position was available, the Complainant would be contacted. She then transferred the call to Ms. Fafard. Here are the relevant parts of the transcript of this conversation, which was prepared based on the playing of the cassette at the hearing:\n[Translation]\n. . .\nMr. Kasongo: Um, I\u2019m calling you because, well, you told me that you did not receive my resume.\nMs. Fafard: Mm-hmm.\nMr. Kasongo: Did...\nMs. Fafard: You were supposed to send it by fax...\nMr. Kasongo: Um, well you see\u2026\nMs. Fafard: ...last week, wasn\u2019t it?\n[97] Indeed, the Complainant had contacted Ms. Fafard earlier to find out if she had received his resume for the position of diversity advisor. She apparently answered that she had not, and the Complainant apparently told her that he had submitted it to the reception desk. Ms. Fafard then apparently suggested that the Complainant fax in a new copy. Based on the conversation recorded by the Complainant, it appears that he never did so.\n[98] The recording continues:\n[Translation]\nMr. Kasongo: Yes, But in fact I wanted to check\u2026 I checked with the receptionist\u2026\n. . .\nMr. Kasongo: ...who told me that she handed you my resume [In the recording of the conversation with Ms. Cinq-Mars, which was heard at the hearing, she did not say that she had submitted the Complainant\u2019s resume to Ms. Fafard.] It\u2019s been a month already since I submitted the resume for the position of employment equity officer and I have received no news. That\u2019s why\u2026\nMs. Fafard: Which... which job? Sorry?\nMr. Kasongo: It was... There was an opening. You advertised it in L'Eau vive...\n. . .\nMr. Kasongo: ...for an officer responsible for employment equity...\nMs. Fafard: Oh! Yes, yes.\nMr. Kasongo: ...Equity Program. Yeah?\nMs. Fafard: Yes. Um, the... that position is already filled...\nMr. Kasongo: Yes.\nMs. Fafard: ...but I spoke to you last week, and I think I told you to send your resume because we have a position at this time for a tran\u2026 a translator.\nMr. Kasongo: Yes, yes.\nMs. Fafard: Are you interested in that one?\nMr. Kasongo: Sure! Of course! But I was interested in the other one, eh, but, well, I spoke to Laurie, and I wanted to confirm. She said she already gave you my resume.\nMs. Fafard: O.K.\nMr. Kasongo: Yes, and I ...\nMs. Fafard: That one was for the other position.\nMr. Kasongo: Yes, it was for the other position...\nMs. Fafard: Yes.\nMr. Kasongo: ...and the resumes are kept for six months at your organization.\nMs. Fafard: Yes.\nMr. Kasongo: Yes. So, do I have to send another resume again?\nMs. Fafard: Oh! No, I can look for the other one.\nMr. Kasongo: You can look for the other resume?\nMs. Fafard: Yes.\nMr. Kasongo: But why did you not call me for\u2026 at least, for the other position? I also wanted\u2026 That\u2019s why I applied.\nMs. Fafard: Well, it\u2019s Martine No\u00ebl-Maw who\u2026 who was in charge of that\u2026 of that position. So I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t call. Normally, we don\u2019t call candidates, unless they have\u2026 they are selec\u2026 um, are chosen for an interview.\n. . .\nMs. Fafard: That\u2019s the way we... we... it says this on all our\u2026\n. . .\nMs. Fafard: ...our advertisement in the paper.\n. . .\nMs. Fafard: It says that you are... you are contacted...\n. . .\nMs. Fafard: ... if you are chosen for an interview.\nMr. Kasongo: O.K. So I wasn\u2019t chosen for that?\nMs. Fafard: Yes.\nMr. Kasongo: O.K. Can you find the resume for the translator position?\nMs. Fafard: Yes. Yes. I\u2026 I can\u2026 I can indeed use it for the\u2026 for that position.\nMr. Kasongo: O.K. So there is no need for me to send you another resume?\nMs. Fafard: No.\nMr. Kasongo: O.K. O.K. That\u2019s what I wanted to find out from you, in any case.\n. . .\n[99] The Complainant confirms that he was never invited to take the written exam or attend an interview for the diversity advisor position. Martine No\u00ebl-Maw says that she selected two people for interviews: a woman who was working for the Saskatchewan government in a capacity that involved equity, and the second person, an Aboriginal named Don Racette, who was ultimately given the position. Ms. No\u00ebl-Maw says she never received the Complainant\u2019s resume. However, after seeing his resume, she adds that she would not have called him for an interview because he had neither the skills nor the experience sought for the position, in her view. The Complainant chose not to cross-examine Ms. No\u00ebl-Maw and her evidence on this subject was never contradicted.\n[100] Once again, the Complainant must first establish a prima facie case as described above. As far as this position is concerned, the Complainant did not meet this burden because he was unable to establish that he had the academic skills and experience needed to qualify. He does not have a university degree in human resources or a related field, and he did not adduce evidence of at least three years of solid experience in diversity, employment equity and project management in the workplace.\n[101] The Complainant\u2019s allegations regarding this position are therefore dismissed.\nD. The Position of Translator [102] The Complainant never applied for this position. Rather, Ms. Fafard submitted the Complainant\u2019s resume to Ms. Kenny for inclusion. Indeed, Ms. Fafard testified that, following her aforementioned telephone conversation with the Complainant, she found the Complainant\u2019s resume in the file where resumes not accompanied by a cover letter are kept, and handed it to Ms. Kenny so she would consider it for the translator position.\n[103] The translator\u2019s job is to translate various documents, originating from all the organization\u2019s divisions, from English to French (80% of the time) and from French to English (5% of the time).\n[104] According to Ms. Kenny, even though the Complainant did not have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in translation, she decided to consider him for the position. The Complainant was invited to take the written tests for the translator position. On July 4, 2000, he took the written test. Ms. Kenny said he failed it. She said his translation contained errors of terminology and agreement as well as anglicisms.\n[105] At the hearing, the Complainant said that the successful candidate did not take the same test as he did. However, he provided no evidence, other than suspicions, in support of his determination that there were irregularities. Without concrete evidence, I cannot accept these allegations by the Complainant. Impressions and suspicions do not constitute evidence.\n[106] Ms. Kenny testified that the written test is the same for everybody. It was done electronically. The applicants are asked to prepare their answer and save it to a diskette, which is then remitted to Ms. Kenny. For candidates unable to attend, e.g. out-of-province candidates, the test is done over the Internet and Louise Beaudoin, Ms. Kenny\u2019s Assistant, administered the test by sending it to the candidate. The candidate has two hours to complete the test. The candidates who pass the written test are invited to an interview.\n[107] Shortly after completing the test, the Complainant spoke on the phone with Marie-France Kenny. He recorded the conversation. Here are a few excerpts:\n. . .\nMs. Kenny: . . . I was calling you because I looked at your translation test again. . . . And unfortunately, I did not grant you an interview. And if you like, I\u2019m prepared to share the corrections with you . . . or even to send them to you, and you will see for yourself . . . There are several things. There were several anglicisms \u2014 things like that \u2014 and even though you\u2019re a good French teacher . . . I\u2019m sure that Nicole, on the same translation test . . . that there were apparently also \u2026 because you don\u2019t teach anglicisms, etcetera. . . . That\u2019s why we were asking for a Bachelor\u2019s degree in translation, because there are things that you learn when you do a Bachelor\u2019s degree in translation. . . which you don\u2019t necessarily learn when you teach French, do a certificate or, whatever \u2014 your Bachelor\u2019s . . . in French Second Language. . . . So if you want, I have no problem sending you your test . . . I can even send you an electronic copy if you want. . . and I put track changes on. So you can see what I added and what I struck out. So it will be very visible to you, then . . . so you can see it. So that\u2019s why I called you. I corrected it, but I wanted to speak to you in person about it, you see. I didn\u2019t want to send you a letter. I wanted to speak to you about it directly.\nMr. Kasongo: Exactly. Pour for the translation, I \u2026 I completely agree with you. I just wanted to give it a try, and. . . . It\u2019s not, um, my specialty. [Emphasis mine.]\n. . .\n[108] Based on this recording, which he tendered in evidence himself, the Complainant acknowledges that translation is not his specialty and that he was simply giving it a try when he applied. He also says that he agrees with Ms. Kenny\u2019s comments regarding his written test. The Complainant did not seek to temper or explain these statements when he presented his evidence.\n[109] Based on the facts, I must conclude that the Complainant has been unable to make out a prima facie case of discrimination for the translator position. In other words, he was unable to satisfy the Tribunal that he was qualified for the position.\nIV. Decision [110] For the foregoing reasons, the Complainant\u2019s complaints of discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin and family status in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. (1985), c. H\u20116, cannot succeed.\n[111] In his submissions, counsel for the Respondent, citing subsection 50(6) of the Act, asked that the Tribunal order the Complainant to pay the witness fees if the complaint is dismissed.\n[112] Subsection 50(6) provides:\nAny person summoned to attend the hearing is entitled in the discretion of the member or panel to receive the same fees and allowances as those paid to persons summoned to attend before the Federal Court.\n[113] I do not believe that this subsection is intended to enable a party to seek costs. Its objective is to ensure that witnesses who have been summoned can obtain some form of compensation, and nothing more. To grant the Respondent\u2019s request would be to distort the meaning of the provision. Perhaps the Tribunal has the power to award the parties costs under certain circumstances, but this subsection is certainly not the source of that power.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario June 21, 2005\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T932\/5204\nStyle of Cause: Daniel Kasongo v.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 25 2005\/07\/11\n[1] Richard Warman filed a complaint on September 7, 2003, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against Tomasz Winnicki, alleging that Mr. Winnicki communicated or caused to be communicated messages which were likely to expose persons to hatred on the basis of religion. The Commission now seeks to amend the complaint to add the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and colour. The complainant supports the amendment.\n[2] In his response to the motion, Mr. Winnicki stated that Mr. Warman and the Commission are persecuting him and that the motion to include the additional grounds of the complaint constitutes further evidence of this persecution.\n[3] The Tribunal has the discretion to amend a complaint to deal with additional grounds of discrimination and additional allegations provided that the substance of the original complaint is respected and that sufficient notice has been given to the respondent to enable him to properly defend himself (Warman v. Kyburz 2003 CHRT 6, at para 5).\n[4] I am satisfied that both of these conditions have been met in the present case. The proposed amendment is linked to the substance of the original complaint since the additional grounds relate to material that was allegedly communicated by Mr. Winnicki over the Internet.\n[5] Moreover, there is nothing before me to indicate that Mr. Winnicki will be prejudiced in any way in the preparation of his defense if leave to amend the complaint is granted. Document disclosure, including the material that raised allegations based on the new grounds, was provided to Mr. Winnicki in April, 2005. In addition, in May, 2005, Mr. Winnicki received notice of the new grounds in the Joint Statement of Particulars and the Notice of Motion to amend the complaint.\n[6] The hearing in this case is scheduled to begin on August 8, 2005. Therefore, Mr. Winnicki will have had three months to prepare a defense against the complaint based on the new grounds. This is sufficient notice to ensure that Mr. Winnicki is not prejudiced by the amendment.\n[7] Accordingly, leave is granted to the Canadian Human Rights Commission to amend Mr. Warman's complaint to include the additional grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and colour in the s. 13(1) complaint against Mr. Tomasz Winnicki. The Commission shall have 10 days within which to serve and file an amended complaint form, together with an amended Statement of Particulars and any necessary supplementary disclosure.\nSigned by Karen A.

Introduction [1] The question whether the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award costs is presently before the Federal Court. It will take some time to settle the legalities of the matter, however. The parties have accordingly asked me to assess the costs in the present case, while the details of the litigation are fresh in the minds of the parties. It appears that there is some financial urgency on the Complainant's side.\n[2] The parties have agreed upon the methodology and the basic principles that should be followed in conducting an assessment. Since this is the first time that the Tribunal has formally assessed costs, I have tried to limit my comments to the rudiments of the process.\n[3] Mr. Bagambiire has presented me with a bill of costs, listing the actual fees and disbursements that were charged to his client. The grand total of fees, disbursements and GST that he is seeking under the bill are $372,612. This has become the real issue between the parties on remedy.\nII. Basic Principles A. The Discretion Over Costs is Governed by the Principle of Austerity [4] As I understand the law, the discretion over costs is governed by the principle of austerity. This is the term used by Mr. Stinson in Kassam v. Canada, [2005] F.C.J. No. 799 at para. 8 (F.C.A.), where he says that an assessment officer should exercise his discretion conservatively, with a view to the sense of austerity that should pervade costs, to preclude prejudice relative to the payer of costs.\n[5] This is fundamental to the process. The focus of the inquiry in assessing costs is on what the Respondent should pay, rather than what the Complainant should recover. This difference in focus is significant. The Respondent should not be required to pay more than was necessary to prosecute the case.\n[6] The process of assessing costs has a peculiar character of its own, which relies heavily on the assessor's judgement. Mr. Stinson quotes Lord Justice Russell, who apparently stated that assessment is rough justice, in the sense of being compounded of much sensible approximation. This feeling of impreciseness is probably inherent in the process.\nB. The Applicable Standard is Fair and Reasonable [7] It will be apparent that some kind of standard is needed, to assess the proper cost of the services that were rendered. The parties have accepted my suggestion that the applicable standard is what is fair and reasonable. The notion of fairness introduces an additional criterion, which reflects the procedural standard under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Fees may be reasonable but not entirely fair.\n[8] There is caselaw that supports this approach. In Smith v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2005] O.J. No. 2275 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), the Ontario Divisional Court dealt with an award of costs in an appeal from a hearing before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. The court recognized, at para. 2, the principle that costs must be reasonable, and fair to the losing party, whose reasonable expectations must be taken into account. The Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed the same standard in Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario, [2004] O.J. No. 2634.\n[9] The purpose of assessing costs is accordingly to determine the fair and reasonable costs of the litigation. The process of assessment should be governed by the same sense of austerity that guides the exercise of the larger discretion.\nIII. Methodology A. The Federal Court Rules Apply [10] The magnitude of the claim in the present case calls for a new means of assessment. In the past, the Tribunal has awarded costs on the basis that they constitute expenses under section 53(2)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Thus, in Milano v. Triple K Transport Ltd. (2003) CHRT 30, and Premakumar v. Air Canada, No. 2 (26 April 2002), T.D. 03\/02 (CHRT), Ms. Mactavish awarded a complainant reasonable legal expenses. In Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada, No. 3 (29 March 2001), T.D. 1\/01 (CHRT), she awarded reasonable solicitor-client expenses.\n[11] The costs that were dealt with in these cases were of a different order of magnitude than the costs claimed in the present case. They were therefore more amenable to this analysis. I went a different way in Brown v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (2004) CHRT 30, where I held that legal fees should not be described as expenses under the Act. This would make the mistake of treating them as disbursements.\n[12] This is significant because the remedial provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act contemplate full recovery of the expenses incurred by a successful complainant. This is not appropriate on costs. The notion of reasonableness that applies to disbursements is not the same as the notion that applies to costs. The notion that applies to costs is based on what the Respondent should be required to pay, rather than what the Complainant has spent.\n[13] This is a more prescriptive standard, which requires some means of assessing the fair and reasonable costs in a given case. Mr. Bagambiire reluctantly agreed that the necessary means of assessment can be found in the Federal Court Rules. These Rules provide a set of principles and a methodology for assessing costs. They also have a Tariff, which contains a list of services that can be claimed. This provides the modus operandi of the assessment process.\n[14] It makes sense that the Federal Court Rules would apply. Costs are costs. Mr. Brooks is entitled to the same costs as other litigants in the Federal System. There is no premium for filing a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Indeed, I was informed that the Complainant has a constitutional action proceeding in the Federal Court. I see no reason why he should do better here.\n[15] The parties agreed that it may be necessary to modify the Tariff to reflect any differences in the procedures before the Tribunal. As Mr. Bagambiire put it, the Tariff should not be a strait jacket. I think a certain amount of improvisation is an inevitable part of the process. There is also room for adjustments, at the beginning and end of the process.\nB. Tariff B [16] The Federal Court Rules contain two tariffs. The first, Tariff A, deals with court fees. The parties did not refer to it. There is also a second Tariff, Tariff B, which deals with counsel fees and disbursements allowable on assessment. This Tariff contains a table assigning a range of units that may be awarded for the services covered by the Tariff. The parties agreed that this provides the basic methodology for any assessment by the Tribunal.\n(i) The Tribunal Must Determine What Services Were Necessary and Assess Their Cost [17] The task of a Tribunal applying the Tariff is twofold. The Tribunal must determine what services were necessary. In most cases, this is a relatively simple task. The Complainant simply submits a bill of costs, setting out the services that were rendered, in accordance with the Tariff.\n[18] The word necessary should not be interpreted too strictly in this context. There may be different views as to what is necessary and the Complainant and his counsel are entitled to exercise a certain judgement in the matter.\n[19] The Tribunal must then determine the cost of these services under the applicable standard. This requires some rating of the value to be attributed to different services. This is supplied by the Tariff, supplemented by the submissions of counsel and the experience of the Tribunal. It is for the party seeking costs to establish the necessity and value of the services.\nC. The Appropriate Column is Column 3 [20] The first step under Tariff B is to decide on the column that should be used in the assessment. Mr. McCrossin submitted that the appropriate column is column 3. This is the default column under Rule 407. Mr. Bagambiire argued for costs under column 5, the highest column.\n[21] The issue is whether the Complainant is entitled to party-and-party or solicitor-client costs. The Respondent cited the Federal Court of Appeal in Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. v. Lee-Shanok, [1988], F.C.J. No. 594 at para. 27, where it said:\n... a judge must be `extremely cautious in departing from the general rule' that only party and party costs should be allowed a successful litigant .... An extraordinary award of this kind [i.e., of solicitor-client costs] ought only to be made in circumstances that are clearly exceptional, as would be the case where an adjudicator wished thereby to mark his disapproval of a party's conduct in a proceeding.\nI see nothing that could be characterized as exceptional in this context.\n[22] The hearing was occasionally turbulent. The parties had strong views, and exchanged emotional and even angry allegations. This is a regular part of the human rights process, however, which often raises provocative issues for the parties. I do not see anything that would take the present case out of the usual range of cases that come before the Tribunal.\n[23] I have already said that there is no premium for filing a human rights complaint. I nevertheless think that a certain premium may apply, in cases that raise social, historical, or institutional issues that need to be addressed. I think it is better to let other Tribunals decide the matter. The present case falls below whatever threshold may apply, in such cases.\n[24] The Respondent should not be penalized for contesting a case that it legitimately disputes. The appropriate column is clearly column 3. There was a real dispute between the parties. There were successes on both sides.\nD. Assessment [25] The parties agreed to proceed through Tariff B, item by item, in a relatively informal manner. I gave each side an opportunity to make submissions and then awarded a specific number of units for the service. The value of each unit at the time of the assessment hearing was 110 dollars. This value changed to 120 dollars on April 1, 2005.\n[26] The parties have taken a different view as to which value should apply to the present award. Mr. Bagambiire submits that the matter was remained unresolved as of April 1, when the unit value was adjusted. He has referred me to the decision of the Federal Court in AIC Ltd. v. Infinity Investment Counsel Ltd., [1998] F.C.J. No. 904, where Justice Rothstein held that a new Rule relating to costs should apply to an award of costs that takes place after the Rule comes into effect.\n[27] The parties essentially agree that the issue is whether the rights under the award have already accrued. Ms. Cameron, for the Respondent, argues that the line by line costs were fixed during the assessment, which took place before April 1. The matters that were dealt with after April 1 related to legal issues and the global question whether I should exercise the discretion under the rules to increase or decrease the assessed costs.\n[28] I think both sides would agree that the number of units to be awarded for each service was fixed at the time of the assessment hearing. There were submissions and a decision from the Tribunal on each item, and other than errors or discrepancies, I would think that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to assess these costs has been exhausted. This does not mean that the monetary value of the award has been fixed, however.\n[29] The real issue on the monetary figure is collection. The Complainant's right to collect a particular unit value, and a specific monetary entitlement, does not accrue until the ruling has been issued. I think that this is the effective date. The idea behind the Tariff is to establish the value of past services, at the time that the costs become due. This value must be assessed at the standard that exists on the day the ruling has been signed.\n[30] There is an additional problem. I do not see how a person conducting an assessment can conduct one part of the assessment under one unit value, and complete it under another. If there is a certain element of good fortune in this, which must be awarded to one side or the other, I think it must go to the Complainant. The Respondent already has the benefit of the principle of austerity. I have accordingly readjusted the figures under Tarriff B to reflect a unit value of 120 dollars.\n[31] The Tariff gives the person assessing the costs a discretion to determine the number of units that should be awarded for each service. The assessor may, for example, award 3 to 7 units for the preparation and filing of a contested motion. The parties agreed that there were four distinct matters, all argued separately, which can be conveniently described as contested motions. After hearing from the parties, I accordingly awarded from 3 to 5 units for each of these matters.\n[32] The Registry Officer prepared a table, as we went through the assessment, containing a list of the units assigned for each service. After we had gone through the costs, a similar procedure was followed for the disbursements. There is a list of general factors in Rule 420 of the Federal Court Rules, which may be considered in assessing costs. These kinds of factors naturally come into play, in proceeding through the exercise.\n(i) Choice of Counsel [33] The major issues that arose in going through the assessment deserve further comment. The first is that the Complainant retained counsel outside Halifax. The Respondent argued that any costs that flow from this decision should be borne by the Complainant.\n[34] The matter is more complicated than it appears. As it turns out, the Commission's investigator was in Toronto. Mr. Bagambiire was originally hired because he was in the same city. There were extensive discussions with respect to the details of the file. As a result of these discussions, Mr. Bagambiire was the logical choice, when it came to choosing counsel for the hearing.\n[35] There is more, however. Mr. Bagambiire comes from the Halifax area. He is known as an advocate in the black community and has a particular expertise in human rights. It was apparent that Mr. Brooks feels a more general weight of prejudice, which goes beyond the confines of the present complaint. The evidence before me suggested that there has been a bitter divide between the black and white communities in the Halifax area.\n[36] I do not want to suggest that members of minorities are entitled as a matter of course to choose lawyers from their own community. I nevertheless think that this is one of those areas where special considerations may apply in the human rights process. Mr. Brooks has had psychological issues in the past. I think he took some legitimate comfort from the fact that his senior counsel could represent him, with all the insight and knowledge that come from living one's life as a member of the same minority.\n(ii) Junior Counsel [37] The case was hard fought on both sides. The Respondent was served by two counsel, who had the assistance of the representatives and officers in the department. In the circumstances, I think Mr. Brooks was entitled to a second lawyer. I do not see why he needed another lawyer from Toronto. I accordingly allowed the costs for junior counsel but disallowed the disbursements for his travel.\n(iii) Services Before the Referral [38] I have to say that the Respondent misstates the situation when it says, in its written submissions, that I have assessed costs in favour of Complainant's counsel for the Commission stage of the complaint. Counsel may be responding to the fact that I allowed some recovery for the services that Mr. Bagambiire provided at a mediation in Halifax. This was a mediation held by the Tribunal, however, after the case was referred, and should be construed as part of the inquiry process.\n[39] The Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to its own process. Any award for costs should be restricted to the costs that were incurred in prosecuting the case before the Tribunal. The costs that I have allowed are basically for services rendered by counsel for the Complainant in the hearing process. The attached tables speak for themselves.\n[40] The matter is not capable of precise limits. The Complainant is also entitled to something, on the basis that some of the services provided before the matter was referred can be construed as a natural and inevitable part of the Tribunal process. I have accordingly allowed a few disbursements for the services before the Commission. I have also taken this into account in making the final adjustments to the global figure.\n[41] The caselaw recognizes that a complainant is entitled to remuneration for consulting a lawyer and initiating the discussions with the Commission, even if costs are not awarded. This only goes so far. In the immediate case, there was an extensive and prolonged dialogue between counsel for the Complainant and the Commission. This kind of service goes well beyond the kinds of costs that can be recovered from the Respondent.\n(iv) Unnecessary Motion [42] The Respondent also took the position that a motion to clarify the decision was unnecessary. Although my sympathies are primarily with the Respondent on the issue, I think the Complainant was entitled to recover something for the motion. I accordingly awarded the minimum number of units for the motion.\n(v) GST [43] The total fees are $70,800. There was a dispute as to whether the Complainant was entitled to GST on the costs and disbursements. I held that these taxes are an inevitable cost, in the nature of disbursements, and should be borne by the Respondent. They should not be used to artificially reduce the Complainant's recovery, which is well below his actual costs.\n(vi) Total [44] The table of assessed costs prepared by the officer in the case is attached. The total of assessed costs, with GST, is $75,756.\n(vii) Disbursements [45] The parties then proceeded through the Complainant's list of disbursements, item by item, in much the same manner. There were general submissions from the Respondent that the disbursements were excessive. There were also submissions on an item by item basis.\n[46] I disallowed most of the disbursements related to services that were provided before the complaint was referred. There were exceptions. The main item in this regard was a rather general claim for:\nCopying, fax, courier, QL & misc. expenses, 2001 to present: $13,643.62.\n[47] After hearing submissions from the parties, I allowed $9,000 for this item. This allows some recovery of the expenses before the Commission.\n[48] There was also a dispute about two expert's reports. The first was for an actuarial report. This report was prepared for settlement purposes, before the referral. I do not think it would be fair to ask the Respondent to cover the costs associated with this report, since it was not needed for the hearing.\n[49] There was a second report from Dr. Henry, an expert in race relations. The Complainant was within his rights to purchase this kind of report, which is commonly relied upon in cases of discrimination. The Respondent objected that the report was not a proper expert's report and was ruled inadmissible as a result. There is merit in this submission. After hearing from both sides, I allowed $1,800 for the preparation of this report, a reduction of $1,000.\n[50] The Complainant claimed $8,997.63 for transcripts of that part of the hearing that dealt with liability. Mr. Bagambiire argued that the hearing took place over a long period of time. He accordingly needed the transcripts to prepare his final submissions. I allowed $5,350, including GST.\n[51] Mr. Bagambiire said that it was impossible to provide a line by line accounting of long distance charges. I accordingly allowed an additional charge, without receipts, for $300.\n[52] The disbursements claimed by Mr. Bagambiire are included in his original bill of costs. The total of assessed disbursements is $22,590. Since the GST was already included in the individual disbursements, there was no adjustment for the GST. The table of assessed disbursements prepared by the officer in the case is attached.\n(viii) Total of Fees, GST and Disbursements [53] The total of assessed fees, GST, and disbursements is $98,346.\nIV. Final Adjustments [54] The parties agreed that the Tribunal should make final adjustments, after the fees allowable under the Tariff have been calculated. The Respondent submitted that the Tribunal must not fetter its discretion by simply deferring to the amount calculated under the Tariff. The assessing officer has a discretion and must exercise it.\n[55] I have rejected some of the submissions from the Complainant. Mr. Bagambiire argued, for example, that the costs should be increased to reflect the fact that the Federal Court Tariff no longer captures the real cost of legal services in the marketplace. This is a common complaint, with any Tariff, and must be dealt with in another forum.\n[56] Mr. Bagambiire also argued that many of the services that he rendered are not covered by the Tariff. My response is that Mr. Brooks is generally entitled to his costs for the inquiry. These are covered by the Tariff. If he wants to obtain extra services, that is his prerogative. But he cannot expect the Respondent to pay for them.\n[57] I would go further. If the Complainant wanted to recover additional costs, I think he was obliged to justify them on a case by case basis. Item 27 in Tariff B allows a party to claim costs for such other services as may be allowed by the assessment officer or ordered by the Court. This does not prevent him from asking for a more general increase on the basis that the file required an unusual amount of work.\nA. Statutory Factors [58] The list of factors in Rule 420 move into the foreground, in making the final adjustments.\n(i) Rule 400(2)(a)- Results [59] Rule 420(a) states that a court may consider the result of the proceeding. The Respondent argues that Mr. Brooks only succeeded in proving one of the three allegations before me. He did not obtain employment. He did not obtain the kind of compensation that he was seeking. It follows that he was largely unsuccessful.\n[60] Mr. Bagambiire looked at the matter in a different way. He stated that Mr. Brooks was seeking a finding of discrimination. It follows that he was a hundred percent successful. There is something to be said for both views. I prefer the middle path. Mr. Brooks was successful, but the results were mixed.\n[61] There is a good deal of hindsight in the Respondent's submissions. Although there is room for debate on the matter, I think both sides were entitled to litigate the full range of issues before me. The issue that arises in considering the results of the litigation is whether it was reasonable for the Complainant to prosecute the case, not whether he succeeded.\n[62] At the end of the day, the most important fact in this context is the finding that the Respondent discriminated against Mr. Brooks. The significance of this result should not be discounted. The Complainant established that the competition that was held in 1992 was manifestly unfair.\n(ii) Rule 400(2)(b)- Quantum [63] Rule 400(2)(b) states that a court may consider the amounts claimed and the amounts recovered. The Respondent asserted that there was a disparity between the magnitude of the claim and the amount recovered.\n[64] There are two sides to this. I cannot accept the Respondent's submission in the context of the award for pain and suffering. The modest nature of the award that was given under this head of compensation for pain and suffering was based on statutory limits. I think it is clear that, without the statutory limit, Mr. Brooks would have received much more.\n[65] The Respondent's submission is well-founded, however, with respect to the claim for lost income. It is clear that Mr. Brooks was seeking substantial damages for lost income. He did not obtain these. This is a factor, on costs.\n(iii) Rule 400(c)- Importance and Complexity [66] Rule 420(c) refers to the importance and complexity of the issues. I have to say, in all candour, that in my opinion counsel made the facts more complicated than they had to be. I am speaking in particular of the Complainant's side.\n[67] From a legal perspective, the case was not particularly complex. It nevertheless raised some difficult probative issues, which required careful analysis of the law. There were a number of side issues. My own view is that the importance of the case lies in the weight to be accorded to the perceptions of various witnesses.\n[68] The issues raised on costs are also significant. This is new territory.\n(iv) Rule 400(3)(e)- Any Written Offer to Settle [69] Rule 400(3)(e) states that a court may consider any written offer to settle. The Respondent tendered two letters under this rule, which were marked for identification. These letters contain offers to settle the complaint for a greater sum of money than the Complainant received in the Tribunal process.\n[70] Rule 400(3)(e) refers to any written offer to settle. The Respondent underscores the word any. There may be a difference of interpretation here. I do not think, for myself, that the word any in Rule 400(3)(e) was ever intended to supplant the common law on without prejudice communications.\n[71] The Respondent has also given me the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Apotex Inc. v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Ltd., [2001] F.C.J. No. 727. This decision merely says that a written offer cannot be introduced on the question costs unless it contains a clear and unequivocal offer. A conditional offer does not meet the requirements of the Rule.\n(a) The Law Requires Notice [72] The caselaw from the Complainant establishes that a without prejudice offer of settlement is only admissible in assessing costs if the party making the offer has given notice that it intends to introduce the offer on the issue of costs. Orkin adopts the same position. The leading case in Canada appears to be Graham v. Dillon (1986), 5 B.C.L.R. (2d) 218 (B.C.S.C.).\n[73] It is important to be clear on terminology. In its written submissions, the Respondent discusses the meaning of the term without prejudice:\nThe term [without prejudice] conveys that the sending party is writing the letter without prejudice to its position in the litigation, and in particular, without an admission that could be used against it to establish liability.\nI think this is too restrictive.\n[74] The concept of without prejudice simply means that a party preparing a document has provided it, for settlement purposes, on the understanding that the document will not be used against it. A party may specify that a document is without prejudice for one purpose and with prejudice for another. A letter may be without prejudice on the substantive question of liability, for example, and with prejudice on remedy or costs.\n[75] There are two competing legal principles that come into play in this context. The first is that the parties should be given the freedom to negotiate a settlement, without fear that their negotiations will be used against them. The second is that a party who rejects a reasonable offer is not entitled to recover the full costs of the litigation. The Respondent submits that the latter principle is one of the primary considerations in assessing costs.\n[76] It is the first principle that is primary, however. The second principle merely allows a party to place limits on the without prejudice nature of the document. It is ultimately a question of waiver. A party that intends to introduce these kinds of documents, on costs, needs to send a clear message to the other side that it waives the protections afforded to without prejudice documents on the narrow question of costs. The waiver must be express.\n[77] It is wrong to think that the law allows the introduction of a without prejudice offer into evidence, in spite of the fact that it is without prejudice. There are merely different cases. The kinds of offers that are contemplated in the caselaw are without prejudice to the position taken by the party on the main issue. This does not prevent them from being with prejudice on the question of costs.\n(b) The First Offer [78] The first letter can be dealt with summarily. I agree with the Complainant that Rule 400(3)(e) envisages a complete offer. The Apotex decision would support such a position.\n[79] The first letter tendered by the Respondent does not meet this requirement. It refers to other communications and is inconclusive. It also fails to meet the requirements of notice. The letter is inadmissible.\n(c) The Second Offer [80] The second letter raises more serious concerns. It contains a formal offer, in the following terms:\nWithout any admission of liability whatsoever, our client hereby offers to settle this matter for the all-inclusive sum of $125,000.\n[81] This may be rhetorical excess. The Respondent is willing to pay the Complainant the sum, but without any acknowledgement of liability whatsoever. This assertion cannot be restricted to the litigation. It applies to remedy and costs, as well as the substantive question of liability.\n[82] The second offer does not qualify as an offer of settlement within the meaning of Rule 400. It is one thing for the Respondent to say that the letter is without prejudice to its position in the litigation and another thing to say that it is without prejudice, simpliciter. This is tantamount to saying that it does not exist, for the purposes of the litigation.\n[83] I cannot see how a statement made without any prejudice whatsoever meets the requirements of Rule 400. The reference to any written offer in the Rule is to written offers made with prejudice, at least on the issue of costs. It is easy to forget the point of the rule, which is that a document written with prejudice is not protected by the law. If the Respondent is entitled to introduce the offer on costs, it is only because the other side is entitled to introduce it.\n[84] I think this is revealing. It may be to the Respondent's advantage to introduce the second letter, in the present circumstances. But the case could have gone some other way. If it was the Complainant that had applied to introduce the letter, there is little doubt that the Respondent would be within its rights to object, on the basis that the letter was written without any prejudice whatsoever.\n[85] The Respondent cannot have it both ways. Either it has waived the protections afforded to without prejudice documents, or it has not. I think it is clear that the Respondent has not done so. The second letter is therefore inadmissible. It follows that I have no evidence before me of any offer to settle that may be considered under Rule 400(3)(e).\n1. The Complainant was Entitled to Reject the Second Offer\n[86] I should add, if only for the sake of clarity, that I do not agree with the suggestion that the Complainant should have accepted the second offer. It is not for me to say.\n[87] There is a point of principle here, however. The rights protected by the Canadian Human Rights Act are fundamental. A finding that these rights have been infringed has a symbolic value that extends beyond the financial award that a successful complainant may obtain. It cannot be said, without an admission of liability, that Mr. Brooks obtained less in the litigation than he would have obtained by accepting the settlement.\n[88] Human rights litigation has its private aspects. It is not private litigation, however. There is more than compensation to deal with, in the process. A Respondent cannot escape a finding of discrimination and the costs that go with such a finding, merely by offering a complainant the maximum that is available under the Act.\n(v) Rule 400(3)(g)- Amount of Work [89] Rule 400(3)(g) states that a court may consider the amount of work. Mr. Bagambiire says that the work on the file was unusually onerous, as a result of the complexities in the employment records. He attributes some of this to the Respondent's failure to disclose all of the relevant records.\n[90] This cuts both ways, however, since counsel for the Complainant went further than was necessary, in their examinations on the employment records.\n[91] The Respondent for its part argues that the Complainant was overly litigious. Although I have concerns about the attitude adopted by counsel, the parties were entitled to insist on their rights. Litigation is an exhausting game and the ordinary public does not appreciate the effort that goes into taking a complaint to a hearing.\n[92] I do not accept that the present case called for any extraordinary efforts on the part of counsel, on either side. I nevertheless accept that there was a good deal of work in marshalling the facts. Some of this can be attributed to the long delay in prosecuting the case.\n(vi) Rule 400(3)(h)- Public Interest [93] Rule 400(3)(h) states that a court may consider whether the public interest in having the proceeding litigated justifies a particular award of costs. This is an area where special considerations apply in the human rights process.\n[94] I say this because the human rights process is not private litigation. It has a more fundamental character. The best analogy in the present case is probably with a constitutional tort: the remedy may be a private remedy, but the cause of action has its origins in the broader public interest. This component in the process is primary, even in a case where a complaint concerns a dispute between private parties.\n(a) Hearings Serve the Public Interest [95] The point in the present context is that hearings serve the public interest. The human rights process was designed to bring the problem of discrimination into the open and subject it to public scrutiny. The public policy enshrined in human rights legislation places real value in the fact that a complaint has been heard. This is all the more true when the complaint is substantiated.\n[96] The human rights process has larger aims than the ordinary legal process. These aims include education and the symbolic redress of long standing social or historical grievances. I think that hearings also give individuals an opportunity to express their frustration and disappointment in the face of prejudice and discrimination. These aspects of a hearing are difficult to assess and are not translatable, in strict financial terms.\n[97] The filing of a complaint and the holding of an inquiry provides a process by which society determines what is appropriate and proper, in the employment context. The public benefits from litigation, which helps in the development of the body of law and principle that is needed to resolve social conflicts. This promotes justice and contributes to the common good.\n[98] Although the present case dealt with a complaint from a private party, it dealt with issues that went well beyond the strict parameters of the complaint. I believe that Mr. Brooks' complaint had, in the context of his community, a certain historical significance. This factor must weigh on his side, in the final calculation of costs.\n(vii) Rule 400(3)(k)- Unnecessary Step [99] Rule 400(3)(k)(i) states that a court may consider whether any step in the proceeding was unnecessary. I have already said that I have some sympathy with the Respondent's position that the Complainant's request for a clarification of my decision was unnecessary. This is not a significant factor in the final adjustments. There is a more general question with respect to the attitude exhibited on the Complainant's side, which was stubborn and bellicose. This contributed to the length and difficulty of the hearing.\nB. Other Factors [100] I have considered the factors set out above. Some of these factors militate in favour of an increase in the final costs; some in favour of a reduction. The primary consideration in deciding the final figure, however, is that Mr. Brooks has obtained a finding of discrimination. In my view, this was all that was realistically available to him.\n[101] The job competition that gave rise to the finding of discrimination was held in 1992. It took a long time for the situation to sort itself out. Mr. Brooks apparently had a break-down in the process. This helps to explain why the complaint was not filed until August of 1997.\n[102] There were additional delays at the Commission. The complaint was not referred to the Tribunal until July of 2003. It is now 2005. There is no point in laying blame. It was already late in the game, by the time that Mr. Brooks filed the complaint. The reality is that the complaint came before the Tribunal at such a late stage that it was impossible to rectify the problems in the process.\n[103] Nothing can be done about what happened in 1992. The real solution was to hold another competition. This would have had real consequences for the participants in the process. The winning candidates would have lost their positions. It seems plain that Lisa Howe would have won one of the positions. She would not have had to wait 14 years for a permanent position. Mr. Brooks would have ranked higher in the eligibility list.\n[104] There would have been other benefits on the policy side. Education is one of the goals of the human rights process. A decision to hold a new competition, under the watchful eye of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, would have alerted managers and staff to the issues in the area. It would inevitably have had a ripple effect in improving the hiring and employment practices of the department.\n[105] All of these benefits were lost. The Tribunal cannot order a new competition thirteen years after the original competition was held. The practicalities of the situation do not permit it. There are equitable issues that prevent it. This takes me to the litigation. My reading of the current situation is that Mr. Brooks feels that the Respondent got away with something. There is much to be said for such a view.\n[106] Mr. Brooks can be faulted for overstating his chances of success in a fair competition. I have made it clear that there is no reason to believe that he would have won a second competition. Having said that, I think that his feelings are justified. They deserve affirmation. The entire process was manipulated by Mr. Savoury. The winning candidates were not entitled to their positions.\n[107] It is too late to order a new competition. The question on costs is whether Mr. Brooks was justified in pursuing the litigation so long after the fact, when the natural remedy in the case was unavailable. I think the answer must be yes. The only correction that was possible, it seems to me, was a legal finding that the competition was unfair. This at least corrects the public record and establishes what was right.\n[108] One of the purposes of the adjudicative process is to declare the rights of the parties. This serves an important purpose, even when it is done long after the fact, at a time when more concrete remedies are no longer available. I think the importance of this exercise, in the present circumstances, is enough to justify the litigation. This should be reflected in the costs.\n[109] There is no perfection here. I think the posture adopted by the Complainant has its willful side. It was evident that Mr. Brooks was unhappy with my decision in the case and, in my estimation, the parties have adopted an adversarial approach. This was apparent in the contest over costs and the correspondence between counsel. There are still proceedings in the Federal Court, which apparently concern the more systemic aspects of the matter.\n[110] It has been said that there is a therapeutic element in the inquiry process, which distinguishes it from the process in the civil courts. This has a role to play in restoring the dignity of both sides and promoting harmonious relationships between employers and their employees. I regret to say, in the immediate case, that I see none of the reconciliation that one would hope for in such a process.\nV. Ruling [111] I think the Complainant is entitled to an increase in the global figure. The assessed costs, all inclusive, will be set at one hundred and five thousand dollars ($105,000). This increase in the total reflects an increase in the fees. I consider it a modest increase, in keeping with the austerity that characterizes the assessment process. There is no reason to increase or discount the disbursements.\n[112] Since this is the first time the Tribunal has done an assessment, and the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is in the Federal Court, I think the Respondent is entitled to some time to consider its options in the matter. The costs are therefore payable within sixty days of the date of this order.\n[113] There is one incidental matter. The general practice of the Tribunal is to provide simple interest on financial awards. Simple interest will accordingly be payable on the full amount of the costs. This interest will be calculated on a yearly basis at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. It will accumulate from the day after the sixty days have elapsed. I will reserve my jurisdiction to deal with any outstanding matters for two weeks.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario July 12, 2005\nTable A- Fees from Tariff B of the Federal Court Rules\nUnits\nA.

Introduction\nII. The meaning of the word counsel\nIII. The right to be represented by an agent\nIV. An agent has no independent status\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Section 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that the Tribunal shall give all parties a full and ample opportunity in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. The following ruling deals with the question of whether a lay person can appear as counsel for the Complainant.\n[2] Ms. Rubio appears for the Complainant. She is not a lawyer. She has some training as a paralegal and has apparently appeared in the criminal courts, presumably on summary conviction matters. Ms. Rubio is fluent in Spanish, the Complainant's primary language. She has represented him throughout the course of his complaint.\n[3] I want to be clear. The question is not whether Ms. Rubio can appear on behalf of the Complainant. The question is whether she can appear as counsel. The Respondent has informed the Tribunal, in writing and on the record, that it takes no position on the question. The Canadian Human Rights Commission submits that the Respondent has waived its right to object to her appearance. The question is therefore moot.\n[4] The problem is that the answer to the question before me may have a bearing on other questions that arise in the hearing. It is therefore necessary to deal with it.\nII. The meaning of the word counsel [5] My understanding of the word counsel in a legal context has always been that it refers to a lawyer. This is certainly the general usage in the courts. The word might be used, by analogy, to refer to someone who provides the same services as a lawyer. But that is a descriptive use and not a permissive one.\n[6] The French version of the Canadian Human Rights Act confirms the English usage. Section 50(1) states:\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\nI think the meaning of the word avocat in the subsection is plain. The parties may present their cases in person, or through a lawyer.\n[7] I say this in spite of the fact that I have been directed to a subsidiary definition of avocat in Le Robert Micro, which goes further. This merely suggests that the word may be used in a figurative sense, like the word counsel, to refer to someone who performs the function of a lawyer. One could just as easily say that Ms. Rubio acted as Mr. Filgueira's lawyer in his dealings with the Commission. This is a metaphorical use of the word. It does not make her a lawyer. It does not give her the right to appear in those circumstances where the legislation restricts that right to lawyers.\n[8] Ms. Rubio suggested that the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Olvarria v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration (1973), 41 D.L.R. (3d) 472 (F.C.A.) went in her favour. I cannot agree. The Court in Olvarria held that the word counsel in section 3 of the Immigration Act referred to a lawyer. The French text of section 3 referred to un avocat.\n[9] The Court then turned to the Immigration Inquiries Regulations, SOR\/67 - 621, where the word was apparently used in a broader sense. The French text of the Regulations was different than the Act and rendered the word counsel as un avocat ou autre conseiller. The Court extended the meaning of the English word in this context on the basis that the French version of the Regulations referred unambiguously to both a lawyer and an adviser. This is a matter of respecting the French text.\n[10] The decision in Olvarria stands for the proposition that the meaning of counsel may be extended in those circumstances where the French text demonstrates that the word is being used in a figurative sense, to refer to those who provide the services of a lawyer. That is not the situation before me. The French text of s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, like the Immigration Act, refers to un avocat. As the Court of Appeal in Olvarria recognized, the French usage reinforces and indeed restricts the ordinary meaning of the English term. The word counsel in s. 50(1) refers to a lawyer.\nIII. The right to be represented by an agent [11] This does not mean that Ms. Rubio cannot appear. There are other possibilities. The decision of the Divisional Court in Re Men's Clothing Manufacturer's Association et al. and Arthurs et al. (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 20 (H.C.J.), recognizes that there is a common law right to be represented by an agent, quite distinct from any right to counsel.\n[12] The decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in Thomas v. Association of New Brunswick Registered Nursing Assistants (2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 337 discusses the law relating to agents. At para. 25, Robertson J.A. holds;\nIn summary, at common law, persons appearing before adjudicative tribunals posess the right to be represented by an agent of their choosing.\nThis right exists independently of any right to counsel.\n[13] There are many reasons for an agent to appear. At para. 21, the Court says:\nAn intelligent lay person may be able to define issues and articulate responses more easily than the party to the proceedings. Alternatively, the agent's presence may be for the sole purpose of lending moral support or to assist a principal with a physical or mental handicap. In these circumstances, the lay representative's participation may be countenanced.\nI think this kind of reasoning extends to someone who has difficulty in the official languages of the Tribunal.\n[14] The nature of the business that comes before the Human Rights Tribunal adds to the significance of these kinds of observations in the present context. It seems to me that there are situations where the use of an agent is an inevitable part of the human rights process. I am thinking of cases where a complainant suffers from a psychological or physical condition that makes it difficult and perhaps impossible to appear without the assistance of an agent.\n[15] The Tribunal nevertheless remains the master of its own process. As the New Brunswick Court of Appeal says, in Thomas, at para. 25:\n. the right is not absolute. Tribunals retain a residual discretion to limit participation to those persons that the tribunal believes will facilitate, rather than hinder, the adjudicative process.\nThe Court remarks in an earlier passage, at para. 21, that the participation of a lay person in complex legal cases may only confuse matters further. A Tribunal accordingly retains the discretion . to exclude or to define the extent of any agent's participation at any stage of the proceedings.\n[16] I think all of this helps to explain the significance of s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which recognizes the right to counsel. Under the subsection, a party is entitled to conduct its case through a lawyer. A lawyer who is retained by a party appears as of right. An agent appears only with the permission of the Tribunal. There are obvious reasons for this.\n[17] In my view, Mr. Filgueira is entitled to an agent. He nevertheless has an obligation to satisfy the Tribunal, if the Tribunal deems it necessary, that the agent who represents him is in a position to facilitate the process. There are no concerns in the present case. I am satisfied that Ms. Rubio should be allowed to appear for Mr. Filgueira. She has the advantage of speaking his language; she has some training in the law; and she has a thorough knowledge of the case. I think it is apparent that her appearance will protect the fairness, efficiency and integrity of the hearing.\nIV. An agent has no independent status [18] I want to make a final comment. Ms. Rubio referred to herself as a representative. I am not entirely comfortable with the implications in such a statement. It is one thing to say that Ms. Rubio represents Mr. Filgueira, as his agent, and another thing to say that she is a representative, as if she has some independent capacity to appear. This is dubious: an agent appears only in the capacity of the person for whom she acts.\n[19] This does not affect the practicalities of the situation. An agent speaks for the Complainant. She has the capacity to convey his wishes to the Tribunal, ask questions for him, and otherwise participate in the hearing. She does not have the professional or legal status of a lawyer, however, and has no independent standing in an adjudicative forum.\n[20] There are fundamental differences here. A lawyer has a distinct legal personality, which can be separated from her client. This is what gives her the status of counsel. The significance of this distinction will have to be considered at another time.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 20, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT952\/7204\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRonaldo Filgueira v.

Hadjis, Member Michel Doucet, Member\n2005 CHRT 28 2005\/07\/21\n[1] The Complainants, nine in number, filed complaints on various dates in 2003, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The respondent, Jim Pankiw, was a Member of Parliament. He was defeated in the 2004 federal general election.\n[2] During his time as an M.P., the respondent authored and distributed a brochure called the householder to his constituents in the riding of Saskatoon-Humbolt. The householder is printed and paid for under the auspices of the House of Commons. Each MP is entitled to send up to four householders per year.\n[3] The complainants allege that in October 2003, the respondent distributed a householder that contained discriminatory comments about Aboriginal people contravening ss. 5, 12 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Commission has referred the complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) for hearing.\n[4] The respondent brought a motion for an order that the Tribunal lacks the constitutional jurisdiction to hear the complaints.\nI. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD OF INTERNAL ECONOMY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. A. Proper Use of House Resources [5] Householders are printed using the resources of the House of Commons. Funding for householders is provided by the Board of Internal Economy of the House of Commons. The Board exists pursuant to ss. 50 and following of the Parliament of Canada Act (PCA). Members of the Board include government and opposition Members of the House of Commons. It is chaired by the Speaker of the House. The Board's functions are to act on all financial and administrative matters in respect of the House of Commons, its premises, services and staff, as well as its Members.\n[6] The respondent contends that the Board holds the exclusive authority to oversee householders, including their content.\n[7] Under s. 52.6 (1) of the PCA, the Board has the exclusive authority to determine whether the use of funds, goods, services or premises made available to a Member for the carrying out of parliamentary functions, is proper. The respondent asserts that maintaining a relationship with constituents constitutes one of the parliamentary functions of a Member. Since the publication of householders better enable Members to pursue these relationships, these communications must logically also constitute a parliamentary function.\n[8] The respondent maintains that if the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over this parliamentary function, then no other court or statutory body, including the Tribunal, has the authority to make any determination over the same subject matter. The respondent's contention in this regard is quite bold. The Supreme Court of Canada recently re-affirmed, in Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid 2005 SCC 30 at para. 81, that the CHRA is a quasi-constitutional document and any exemption from its provisions must be clearly stated.\n[9] Does such a clear statement appear in the PCA? In our opinion, it does not. The source for the respondent's assertion regarding the Board's exclusivity is found in s. 52.6 (1) of the PCA, which sets out the following:\n52.6(1) The Board has the exclusive authority to determine whether any previous, current or proposed use by a member of the House of Commons of any funds, goods services or premises made available to that member for the carrying out of parliamentary functions is or was proper, given the discharge of the parliamentary functions of members of the House of Commons, including whether any such use is or was proper having regard to the intent and purpose of the by-laws made under subsection 52.5(1).\n52.6 (1) Le bureau a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour statuer, compte tenu de la nature de leurs fonctions, sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation - pass\u00e9e, pr\u00e9sente ou pr\u00e9vue - par les d\u00e9put\u00e9s de fonds, de biens, de services ou de locaux mis \u00e0 leur disposition dans le cadre de leur fonctions parlementaires, et notamment sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de pareille utilisation au regard de l'esprit et de l'objet des r\u00e8glements administratifs pris aux termes du paragraphe 52.5(1).\n[10] On its face, there is no direct reference to the non-application of the CHRA or the ousting of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The respondent submits, however, that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction over the proper use of House resources by a Member encompasses the content of any material published with those resources. This submission is founded on an interpretation of the English version of s. 52.6 (1), where the term proper is used. According to the Oxford English Dictionary proper is defined as fit, suitable, right, in conformity with the demands of society, decent, and respectable. Thus, argues the respondent, the Board has the exclusive authority to determine if a householder, including its content, has exceeded these bounds of proper use, in the parliamentary context.\n[11] By using the term proper, did Parliament really intend to endow the Board with the authority to determine the fitness, decency, conformity with demands of society, or respectability of householders? A reading of the French version of s. 52.6 (1) suggests otherwise. The word proper is rendered as r\u00e9gularit\u00e9. Le Nouveau Petit Robert, defines r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 as conformit\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles, or in accordance with the rules. The Commission submits that this term is more closely associated with notions of administrative regularity, and we agree. Such a reading is consistent with the direction given in s. 52.6(1) that the Board should, in determining whether the use of House resources was proper, have regard to the intent and purpose of the by-laws made under subsection 52.5 (1). The printing of householders is specifically addressed in the Members' Offices By-Law, No. 301. It is obvious from a reading of the by-laws that their intent and purpose is to regulate the administration of House resources (e.g. purchasing office equipment, printing stationery, leasing office space, remunerating staff, etc.). The by-laws do not contain provisions touching upon human rights principles, nor, for that matter, decent or respectable conduct, to use the definition of proper suggested by the respondent.\n[12] The same conclusion was reached by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ontario v. Bernier, (1994) 70 O.A.C. 400, and the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Fontaine, [1995] A.Q. No. 295 (QL). At issue in both cases was whether s. 52.6 (1) ousted the jurisdiction of the courts to hear a case involving charges that a Member had used the funds allocated to him by the Board in a manner that contravened the Criminal Code. Both courts found otherwise, holding that s. 52.6 (1) only gives the Board authority to determine if a Member of the House of Commons used these resources in a manner consistent with the by-laws. Significantly, the term by-laws of the English text of ss. 52.5 and 52.6 is rendered as r\u00e8glements administratifs in the French version.\n[13] As Mme Justice Arbour commented at paragraph 4 of the Bernier decision, Parliament established the Board to exclusively manage the internal workings of the House of Commons. In so doing, Parliament did not express an intention to remove from the courts their jurisdiction to apply the Criminal Code to Members. In our opinion, the same conclusion can be drawn with respect to the authority of the Tribunal to determine if there has been a violation of the CHRA. Parliament has not shown an intention to exclude Members, and particularly their householders, from the application of the CHRA.\nB. Parliamentary Privilege or Immunity [14] Nor does it appear to us that the PSA, and s. 52.6 in particular, extends the scope of any privilege or immunity from which Members may benefit. Parliamentary privilege provides Members with an absolute immunity from civil or criminal prosecution when speaking in the House of Commons or engaged in a proceeding in Parliament (see J.P.J. Maingot, Parliamentary Privilege in Canada, 2d ed). Over the years, the assertion of parliamentary privilege has varied in its scope and extent. But as the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Vaid (at para. 23), a narrower concept of privilege has developed in more recent times. The Court referred to a 1971 ruling of the Speaker of the House, who stated that parliamentary privilege does not go much beyond the right of free speech in the House of Commons and the right of a Member to discharge his duties in the House as a member of the House of Commons.\n[15] The respondent agrees that the immunity attached to parliamentary privilege does not extend to statements or publications made by Members outside of the House or parliamentary proceedings. Thus, members of legislatures are not immune from criminal prosecution from statements made to the press outside the Chambers of Parliament (see Re: Ouellet (Nos. 1 and 2) [1976] C.A. 788), nor from liability in defamation actions for answers given to a reporter outside a legislature (see Ward v. Clark, 2000 BCSC 979). It follows that there is no immunity from the application of the CHRA.\nII. THE CHRA DOES NOT APPLY TO THE RESPONDENT [16] The respondent further submits that the CHRA does not apply to him because he lacks the federal quality that would make him subject to the federal legislative scheme. He is neither engaged in a federal work, undertaking or business, nor is he a part of the Federal Crown or the Government of Canada. The only factor that brings him within the federal sphere of activity is that in communicating with his constituents through a householder, he is carrying out his parliamentary functions as a member of the House of Commons. His argument is premised on his contention that the legislative authority over a member of the House of Commons is limited to the PCA.\n[17] The purpose and scope of the CHRA is articulated in s. 2, and is not as limitative as the respondent suggests in his submissions. The provision states that the purpose of the CHRA is to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principles of equal opportunity elaborated therein.\n[18] In our opinion, the statutory language of the CHRA is broad enough to also encompass statements made by Members in householders published and paid for by the House of Commons, pursuant to an act of Parliament, the PCA. Since Parliament enacted this legislative framework, which ultimately regulates householders, it is plain that the publication and content of householders must also necessarily fall within the purview of matters coming within Parliament's legislative authority.\nIII. SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES [19] The respondent submits that the Tribunal is an administrative tribunal established under the CHRA and the respondent contends that as such, it is not constitutionally distinct from the executive. To allow it to examine and decide upon the content of a Parliamentarian's communications would undermine the constitutionally enshrined separation of powers.\n[20] As was noted the Supreme Court of Canada in Re Alberta Legislation [1938] S.C.R. 100 at p. 133, the Constitution Act, 1867 contemplates a parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. The institution derives its efficacy from free public discussion of affairs and from the freeist and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of political proposals. The Court added that this principle was signally true in respect of the discharge by members of Parliament of their duty to the electors. The respondent contends that the expression of political views by a member of the House of Commons is political speech and should be subject only to review by the electorate through the democratic process. No outsider, particularly an agent of the executive branch of the State, should be able to interfere with this free and unfettered debate and exchange of ideas in the legislature.\n[21] The respondent argued that the Government should not have any say or control over the free speech of a member of the House, particularly of the Opposition, such as the respondent. Allowing the review of contents of householders and other forms of Members' political speech would limit their ability to fully express their views. This, in turn, would have a chilling effect on the free and public debate of various opinions. It would also result in denying the electorate their Member's real point of view by preventing access to the full and frank information required to make a completely informed decision.\n[22] In Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch), 2001 SCC 52 at para. 32, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that while administrative tribunals span the constitutional divide between the judiciary and the executive and may possess adjudicative functions, they ultimately operate as part of the executive branch of government, under the mandate of the legislature. It is noteworthy, however, that this case related to the degree of institutional independence required of a licensing board, which the Court characterized as first and foremost a licensing body that did not approach the constitutional role of the courts (at para. 33).\n[23] More recently, in the case of Bell v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association, 2003 SCC 36, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of the institutional independence of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. The Court described the Tribunal as follows:\nThe main function of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission. It has many of the powers of a court. It is empowered to find facts, to interpret and apply the law to the facts before it, and to award appropriate remedies. Moreover, its hearings have much the same structure as a formal trial before a court. The parties before the Tribunal lead evidence, call and cross-examine witnesses, and make submissions on how the law should be applied to the facts. The Tribunal is not involved in crafting policy, nor does it undertake its own independent investigations of complaints: the investigative and policy-making functions have deliberately been assigned by the legislature to a different body, the Commission.\n[24] The Supreme Court arrived at the conclusion that this tribunal possesses a high degree of independence from the executive branch. In our opinion, given this finding by the Supreme Court, to treat the Tribunal as an arm of the Government for the purposes of this case is highly questionable.\n[25] The principle of the separation of power between the three branches - executive, legislative and judicial - has its roots in the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867, which calls for a constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom. As the Supreme Court stated in Vaid, at paragraph 21, each of the branches of the State is vouchsafed a measure of autonomy from the others. Parliamentary privilege is one of the ways in which this principle is respected. In Vaid, the Supreme Court affirmed the need for the House's legislative activities to proceed unimpeded by any external body or institution, including the courts. As an example, the Court indicated that it would be intolerable if a Member who was overlooked by the Speaker at question period could file a human rights complaint alleging he had been discriminated against, or seek a ruling from the ordinary courts claiming that his guarantee of free speech under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated (Vaid, para. 20). These are truly matters internal to the House to be resolved by its own procedures.\n[26] The respondent referred us to Federal Court of Appeal decision in Taylor v. Canada (Attorney General) [2000] 3 F.C. 298, a case in which a human rights complaint under the CHRA had been filed against a judge of the Ontario Court, General Division. The judge had allegedly ordered the complainant, who was seated in his courtroom, to remove a headdress that he wore as part of his religious practice. The Federal Court of Appeal held that the principle of judicial immunity applies so as to prevent such proceedings against judges from being brought before the Commission and ultimately, the Tribunal. The principle of judicial immunity exists to ensure that judges can perform their duty with complete independence and free from fear. The respondent submits that just as the independence of the judicial branch must be protected, so must that of the legislative branch. The Tribunal therefore lacks the authority to interfere with either.\n[27] However, one must consider the Taylor case in its factual context. The Federal Court of Appeal noted that orders for the control of order or decorum in the court room during the course of a trial fall within the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The judge had engaged in a purely judicial act to which judicial immunity attached.\n[28] There is no doubt that statements made by a Member in the House of Commons constitute an inherently legislative function that is subject to the immunity associated with parliamentary privilege. No outside authority may interfere with this activity either. But as we have already stated, parliamentary privilege does not attach to statements in householders that are distributed to constituents. In our opinion, this situation is not analogous to the example given by the Supreme Court in Vaid or the fact situation in Taylor.\n[29] The present case can also be distinguished from Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 595 (C.A.Ont.). A human rights complaint was filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission in which it was alleged that the daily recital of the Lord's Prayer by the Speaker of the Ontario Legislature was in breach of the Ontario Human Rights Code. The respondent referred to paragraph 19, where the Court of Appeal of Ontario stated that the Ontario Human Rights Commission is simply an emanation of the Crown and is subject, at the very least, to the same restrictions respecting the Legislature as are the judiciary and executive. The issue for the Court was whether the daily recital of the Lord's prayer was a matter inherently related to the conduct of proceedings within the legislature. The Court found this to be the case and therefore the Code did not apply because of parliamentary immunity.\n[30] Finally, we would also note that although the Supreme Court, in Re: Alberta Legislation, emphasized the importance in our democracy of maintaining free public opinion and discussion, these rights are not absolute. The Court recognized that these values are subject to legal limits, such as the provisions of the Criminal Code and the common law. The Charter and the CHRA equally impose legal limits on free public opinion and discussion.\n[31] For all these reasons, the Respondent's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by J.

THE APPLICATION [1] Ms. Rubio is appearing as an agent for the Complainant. She has applied to have the proceedings translated into Spanish. The request is that the Tribunal pay for the translation.\n[2] I had the opportunity to ask the Complainant a number of questions when the application was made. I am satisfied, on the basis of his answers, and the information provided by Ms. Rubio, that he has a limited command of English. It is difficult to say how far this goes. He understood me when I asked him how he could work for the Respondent without speaking English.\n[3] I am proceeding on the basis that the Complainant has some understanding of English but cannot speak it. His level of comprehension is low. The Registry has already provided translation of his testimony, on the basis of a direction that translation be provided for witnesses who have difficulty testifying in the language of the proceedings.\n[4] The Complainant now applies to have the rest of the proceedings translated.\nII. THE COMPLAINANT ALREADY HAS THE ASSISTANCE OF AN AGENT [5] I think it is significant that the Complainant already has the assistance of an agent. Although Mr. Filgueira has been in attendance throughout the inquiry, he is a passive participant and has left the conduct of his case in the hands of Ms. Rubio. She communicates with him in Spanish, his native language, and has kept him informed of the progress of the hearing.\n[6] Ms. Rubio is not a lawyer and is not appearing as counsel. She appears only with the permission of the Tribunal.\nIII. THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE PROCEEDINGS TRANSLATED [7] I am not aware of any cases that deal with the question before me in the context of a human rights proceeding. Nor have I had the benefit of full legal argument. I will accordingly limit my remarks.\n[8] The right to have the proceedings of the Tribunal translated into a language other than English or French can probably be traced to three legal sources. The first is the common law. The second is section 14 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The third arises under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nA. The Common Law [9] The common law appears to deal with the right to have the proceedings translated as a question of fairness. It is apparent that what is fair will vary in the circumstances of each case. The standard is much higher in a criminal context.\n[10] I believe that the common law still applies. Section 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that the Tribunal shall give all of the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their cases. This brings in the principles of natural justice, which may give rise to procedural rights in certain situations. The parties must be allowed to present their cases and respond to the case on the other side. This may require the services of a translator.\n[11] The purpose of providing translation is to protect the integrity of the process. A Tribunal faced with a request for translation must decide whether translation is needed in the circumstances of the case. The issue is whether the failure to provide the translation would compromise the fairness of the process. The need must be real and compelling.\nB. Section 14 of the Charter of Rights [12] Section 14 of the Charter of Rights states:\n[13] 14. A party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.\n[14] Although it is a criminal case, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, holds that the parties in civil and administrative proceedings enjoy the rights enshrined in section 14. Chief Justice Lamer made it very clear, however, at p. 93, that the rules that apply in different areas of the law must be developed in cases that arise in those areas.\n[15] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has provided me with the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mohammadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. no. 916, which held that applicants before the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board were entitled to the assistance of an interpreter under section 14. This is a helpful decision. I am not convinced that it affects the fundamental premise that the right to the assistance of an interpreter may require different things in different areas of the law.\n[16] The dispute before the Tribunal invokes the rights of the person and accordingly raises matters of fundamental import. The human rights process does not raise the same kinds of concerns as the criminal law, however. It can also be distinguished from immigration and refugee cases, which deal directly with the legal status of the individual.\n[17] Although there is a public element in all human rights litigation, the present case bears the hallmarks of private litigation. The Complainant is looking for monetary damages. The primary issue before me is whether he was discriminated against in the payment of his wages. He has already been before Labour Canada on one of the issues before me.\n(i) Legal Issues [18] There are other reasons why the Tribunal should be cautious in applying section 14. For one thing, the right in section 14 is subject to the reasonable limits contemplated in section 1 of the Charter of Rights. Although I have not had the benefit of submissions on the matter, the point is simply that the right in section 14 is not absolute.\n[19] The wording of the section is also notable. Section 14 gives a party who does not speak the language of the proceedings the right to the assistance of an interpreter. The section does not say that the party has a right to a formal translation of the proceedings. This may be necessary in the context of criminal charges or other penal statutes. But the two formulations are not the same.\n[20] There are real differences between a right to the assistance of an interpreter and a right to translation of the hearing. This is illustrated by the practice of the Tribunal, which generally uses simultaneous translation. This is expeditious and efficient, and in keeping with the mandate of the Tribunal. The logistics of this mode of translation are such, however, that it cannot be provided without three interpreters. The process also requires an individual to monitor the microphones and speakers that are necessary to provide the service.\n[21] The point is simply that there is some room for different interpretations of the scope of section 14. It might be possible to provide consecutive translation, with one interpreter, but that is a more cumbersome process and has costs and inefficiencies of its own. There may be more informal means of meeting the requirements of the section, but none have been suggested to me.\n(ii) The Nature of the Right [22] The nature of the right in section 14 should also be considered. The Tribunal should be wary of absolute or rhetorical standards, which bear no necessary relation to the task at hand. That task is to see that justice is done in the matter before it. I think this requires a pragmatic rather than an abstract standard, which recognizes that the right enshrined in section 14 is instrumental.\n[23] A Tribunal should keep in mind that the right to the assistance of an interpreter serves a larger aim. It ensures that the parties to a legal proceeding can participate meaningfully and effectively in the process, in a manner that guarantees the fairness, thoroughness and ultimately the legitimacy of the process.\n[24] The goal of providing the assistance of an interpreter is to further the process. There are many procedural principles, such as natural justice and certain aspects of the right to make full answer and defence that come into play in this context. None of these principles are exhaustive, I think. They simply guarantee the right of each party to be heard by the Tribunal.\n[25] This is apparent in the passage from Donald G.M. Brown and John M. Evans, for example, in Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 1998) at 10:4100, where they state:\n[26] [...] a person with a right to be heard in proceedings before a court, or an administrative tribunal, is entitled to the assistance of an interpreter in order to ensure that the person can both present proofs and arguments in a manner that can be `heard' by the decision-maker; and respond to the testimony of witnesses and to anything said by the adjudicator.\n[27] I think this contains a helpful statement of the Tribunal's obligations in the present case.\nC. The Canadian Human Rights Act [28] The third source of any right to translation may be the most difficult from a legal perspective. There are two fundamental submissions before me. The first is that the Tribunal has an obligation to put the Complainant in the same position as a litigant who understands the language of the proceedings. Anything less than this, she submits, is implicitly discriminatory and contravenes the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Act prohibits discrimination on the ground of national or ethnic origin.\n[29] This submission is in keeping with the Act. Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in the provision of services customarily available to the public. There is no doubt in my mind that the Registry of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal provides many services to the public. It has a fundamental obligation to respect the principle of equality at the heart of the Act and cannot discriminate in the provision of these services.\n[30] The second submission is that the Tribunal has a duty to accommodate Mr. Filgueira. This deserves serious consideration. I think it is clear that the Tribunal has an obligation, under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and probably in the general law, to accommodate someone who suffers from a physical or psychological disability. The obvious example is probably the provision of some form of assistance to individuals who have visual or auditory disabilities.\n[31] The question is whether the same logic requires that assistance be provided to the members of linguistic minorities. I think the answer is probably yes. The case law establishes that the Tribunal would have an obligation to provide the Complainant with an interpreter if he was deaf. In some circumstances, at least, a language may place a party at a disadvantage and undermine its right to participate fully in the process. The more difficult task is to decide what level of assistance is required.\n[32] The matter is more complicated than it may appear. I think that it is probably necessary to distinguish between the administrative and adjudicative functions of the Tribunal in this context. The Registry is charged with the task of providing those services that are necessary to allow the parties to participate properly in the inquiry. The responsibilities of the members who hear cases lies in another area.\n[33] There are fundamental issues here. I say this because there is a question whether the holding of an inquiry under the Act, and the legal process, in itself, can be properly described as a public service. There are at least some reasons to think otherwise. The physical and logistical aspects of an inquiry cannot be allowed to interfere with the requirements of the process. I do not see how a Tribunal can accommodate the parties, for example, and protect them from the rigours of cross-examination.\n[34] I am not deciding the question. The purpose of an inquiry, however, is to determine the truth and provide some measure of justice to the parties. This must come first in any examination of the Tribunal's responsibilities to the litigants. Any request for accommodation must respect the limits that this inevitably places on the Tribunal's ability to accommodate.\n[35] Whatever the obligations of the Tribunal, I think my discussion of the issues that arise under the common law and the Charter of Rights is sufficient to deal with the present application. I do not think that the Tribunal's obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act require that the rest of the proceedings be translated.\nIV. CONCLUSION [36] It is very easy to say that Mr. Filgueira should be put in the same position as a litigant who was born and raised in the language of the proceedings. The problem is that this does not mean very much, once differences in education, upbringing and natural intelligence are taken into account. The idea that the Complainant must understand every word uttered in a hearing bears little relation to reality.\n[37] The level of understanding required for full participation in a hearing is relatively low. A party must be able to make the decisions that must be made, in order to prosecute the case. This requires an understanding of the actual process. It also requires some appreciation of the significance of the process and the consequences that attach to it.\n[38] The parties have already been through a mediation and I am satisfied from all the circumstances that the Complainant has a good understanding of the case. There is also the plain fact that he has the assistance of an agent in the case, who speaks his language. It is apparent that he has discussed the case at length with Ms. Rubio and is in continual communication with her. They have obviously discussed what evidence should be called and what his witnesses will say.\n[39] I would have thought that the purpose of the agent, aside from conducting the case on the Complainant's behalf, is to ensure that he understands the process. Ms. Rubio cannot speak for Mr. Filgueira in the course of the hearing without reporting to him. There is nothing burdensome in this. It is part of the ordinary conversation that must take place, between any litigant and the person who appears for him.\n[40] No one is asking Ms. Rubio to translate the proceedings or take over the role of an interpreter. There is no simple line of demarcation, however, between the responsibilities of an interpreter and the responsibilities of an agent. The margins overlap. I think it is clear that one of the reasons Ms. Rubio is acting is that she speaks Spanish.\n[41] The substantive and the practical issues come together here. As an agent, Ms. Rubio appears in some legal sense as an extension of Mr. Filgueira. From a practical perspective, she needs to understand exactly what is occurring in the hearing. But of course she does. The legal question is whether this devolves to Mr. Filgueira. If someone appears as an agent, in the capacity of a particular party, can her understanding of the process be attributed to the party?\n[42] I think the fundamental premise of an inquiry is that the parties understand the process. There is some part of this requirement that is personal, whether a party appears on its own or with an agent. It cannot be transferred. The parties must know what is taking place. I nevertheless think the participation of Ms. Rubio in the hearing needs to be taken into account, in deciding whether Mr. Filgueira has a right to have the proceedings translated into Spanish.\n[43] If the Complainant appeared by himself, I suspect that Mr. Filgueira would be entitled to the assistance of an interpreter for the duration of the hearing. There are procedural and practical reasons why this must be so. It would not be possible to hold a hearing without it. The plain fact of the matter, however, is that the Complainant is not appearing by himself.\n[44] I naturally agree that Mr. Filgueira is entitled to be put in the same position of other litigants. That does not, however, require translation of the proceedings. It requires that he be given a full and ample opportunity, in the words of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to advance his case and reply to the other side. I am willing to go as far as I reasonably can, in order to ensure that his rights are protected.\n[45] The Tribunal has an obligation to be prudent in matters of the public purse. Resources are always scarce. All other matters aside, the cost of setting a precedent must be considered, whether the matter is dealt with under the common law, section 1 of the Charter of Rights, or the Canadian Human Rights Act. I make no comment on the tests that apply in this context. I am nevertheless satisfied as a matter of fairness that some parts of the present inquiry need to be translated.\n[46] Ms. Rubio has advised the Tribunal that some of the witnesses that the Respondent is calling will raise questions concerning the Complainant's performance of his duties. She claims that this evidence is new. It may also be central to the case. I agree that Mr. Filgueira needs to know what the witnesses say in this regard, if he is to discuss it with the person who is appearing on his behalf.\n[47] I am accordingly prepared to order that the Complainant be provided with translation for this part of the case. The application of this ruling to the testimony of specific witnesses can be discussed at the appropriate time.\nV.

Grant Sinclair Pierre Deschamps\n2005 CHRT 3 2005\/01\/25\n[1] Under s. 53(4) of the CHRA, when making an order for compensation, the Tribunal may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period it considers appropriate. This however is subject to Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, which provides that, unless otherwise ordered by the Tribunal, an award of interest shall be at a specified rate and for a specified period. In this ruling, we refer to this as the default interest rate.\n[2] CEP will propose (assuming a finding of liability) that the Tribunal make an award of interest different from the default interest rate. CEP also proposes to call Dr. Lawrence Gould to give expert evidence relating to what the appropriate interest rate and interest period should be for any award of interest.\n[3] Bell has brought a motion asking that the Tribunal not receive Dr. Gould's evidence. Bell argues that this evidence is not necessary for the Tribunal to determine an appropriate award of interest.\n[4] For the purpose of its argument on the motion, Bell seeks to introduce as evidence the fact that the Tribunal, when amending the default interest rate in 2004, did not consult any expert opinion. Bell's argument will be that it was not then necessary to have expert assistance and therefore, it is not necessary now.\n[5] For Bell's motion, the Tribunal must decide the question of whether on the facts and circumstances of this case, Dr. Gould's evidence is necessary in determining an award of interest.\n[6] In our opinion, the fact that an expert was not consulted when setting the default interest rate for Rule 9(12) is of no assistance in determining this question. That fact tells the Tribunal nothing about whether Dr. Gould's proposed expert evidence is necessary in this case. It has no probative value.\n[7] Accordingly, Bell's request to introduce this fact into evidence is denied.\nSigned by\nJ.

Introduction\nII. The Case Law\nIII. Costs\nIV. Taking the Temperature\nV. Merit\nVI. Ruling\nI. Introduction [1] The Respondent has applied for a non-suit. After Mr. Capp had made the application, but before he had concluded his remarks, Ms. Rubio objected that the Respondent must elect whether it will call evidence before applying for a non-suit. I allowed her to raise the objection and advised the parties that I would deal with it before proceeding further.\nII. The Case Law [2] Ms. Rubio relies on the decision of this Tribunal in Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 20 (QL), where Mr. Hadjis noted that a variety of Tribunals and Boards have gone different ways on the issue. He then applied the rule in the civil courts. This apparently requires that the defending party make an election before applying for a non-suit.\n[3] The statement of principle in Chopra can be found at para. 22:\nI therefore conclude that the common law rule of election does apply to this Tribunal but that the parties may, on the one hand, waive its application, which is not the case here, and on the other hand, where the appropriate circumstances warrant, a respondent may be exempted from the rule's application by the Tribunal.\nI think there may be room for different views. I agree with Mr. Hadjis that the question should be decided in the circumstances of each case. The Tribunal enjoys more latitude in these matters than a court.\n[4] The decision in Chopra relies heavily on the decision of an Ontario Board of Inquiry in Nimako v. C.N. Hotels, (1985) 6 C.H.R.R. D\/2894. I feel obliged to say that the Board in Nimako seems to have misunderstood the nature of an application for a non-suit. It is wrong to suggest that a Tribunal that entertains a motion for a non-suit is in danger of deciding the case twice. A Tribunal that grants a motion has not decided the case in a legal sense. It has decided that there is no case to meet.\n[5] Mr. Hadjis also refers, however, to the decision of a subsequent Board of Inquiry in Potocnik v. Thunder Bay (City), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 16. The situation in Potocnik was similar to the one before me. Counsel had advised the Board that the Respondent would call evidence if it was put to its election before applying for the non-suit. Mr. Capp has done the same thing. The Board in Potocnik did not ask the Respondent to make its election before applying for a non-suit.\nIII. Costs [6] I have not had the luxury of investigating the rationale behind the introduction of the civil rule. Mr. Capp says that the practice in the courts has changed over the last thirty-five years. There is nevertheless a fundamental difference between the civil process and the human rights process, which has a bearing on the operation of the rule.\n[7] That difference is a practical one. A Respondent that calls evidence in the civil courts can recoup its costs at the end of the case. This is not possible under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Even if the Complainant has not raised any evidence against it, the Respondent will have to pay the expenses that it incurs in presenting its defence. These expenses are obviously substantial. Aside from legal costs, Mr. Capp has advised the Tribunal that some of his witnesses are from outside the city.\n[8] This kind of concern goes beyond the Respondent. The Board in Potocnik considered the cost of continuing with the hearing in deciding to let the Respondent apply for a non-suit before making its election.\n13. The City has also pointed to the cost of this hearing, and cites the case of Tomen v. O.T.F. (No. 3) (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/24.... In that case, the Board of Inquiry ... decided to depart from the normal civil court practice of ordering an election. One of the reasons cited by the Board was the substantial cost of the hearing ... The City points out that everyone's bills for the present hearing are being paid by a public sector that is currently under considerable financial strain, and argues simply that if this hearing can end, it should.\nThese costs are real. I would think that this helps to explain why the law permits an application for a non-suit in the first place.\n[9] I agree with the Respondent's submission that the question of cost is more pressing in the instance of a private employer. It seems rather cavalier to say that these kinds of expenses are simply part of the cost of doing business. Mr. Capp has candidly said that his client has no interest in developing the law or contributing to the public record. The employer's primary concern in the present case is financial, and justifiably so. There are no policy issues before me.\n[10] I think the Board in Potocnik was merely acting responsibly. This is not the place to discuss the test for a non-suit. But the threshold is very low and the Respondent is submitting that there is no evidence against it. If this is the case, why should the Tribunal require that the parties and the public pay the substantial costs associated with continuing the process? There is a point below which the expense, aggravation and inconvenience that attend upon a hearing cannot be justified. The savings that accrue, if a case does not proceed, accrue to all sides. This includes the Complainant.\nIV. Taking the Temperature [11] Ms. Rubio has submitted that it would be unfair to let the Respondent take the temperature by applying for the non-suit. I believe the suggestion is that the Respondent gains an unfair advantage if it loses on the motion, since the Tribunal may somehow reveal its thinking on the case. This kind of concern is misplaced. The function of a Tribunal on an application for a non-suit is simply to decide whether there is evidence in support the Complainant's allegations. There is no weighing of the evidence and nothing to comment on, if the application fails. The Tribunal remains in a state of suspended judgement, its neutrality intact.\n[12] The initial obligations on the Complainant are minimal. The Complainant should not be allowed to evade them. Nor is it any answer to say that the Complainant should be allowed to make up the deficiencies in its case when the Respondent presents its evidence. A Tribunal that grants an application for a non-suit has held that there is no case to make up. Many of the rationales that are cited in the caselaw do not apply unless the Complainant has called some evidence in support of his allegations. The Respondent has no obligation to answer gratuitous allegations.\n[13] It is a serious matter to require that a party in an adjudicative process respond publicly to legal allegations. A party who prosecutes a case in a judicial or quasi-judicial arena has an obligation to lead evidence in support of its claims. I would have thought that this is one of the principles of fundamental justice. Where is the unfairness in finding that a Respondent has no obligation to enter a defence in a situation where there is no evidence against it?\nV. Merit [14] There may be good reasons for requiring an election in some cases. I am sure that there are situations where an application for a non-suit is frivolous or obstructs the process. It is for the Tribunal hearing a particular case to decide what is appropriate in the circumstances before it.\n[15] There are a variety of factors that can be considered in this context. Among other things, I think that a Tribunal is entitled to consider whether the motion is put forward in good faith. It was Ms. Rubio who raised this factor, in submitting that there is no real merit in the application before me. She did not want to call the application frivolous. She nevertheless submitted that it was tactical and abounding in opportunism.\n[16] I do not accept these suggestions. I think the tactics are on the other side. It is the Complainant who is trying to stave off a legitimate motion, which may be fatal to his case. This is understandable, but it hardly provides a principled reason for depriving the Respondent of the opportunity to make the application.\n[17] I take no position on the merits of the application for a non suit. It nevertheless raises issues that deserve serious consideration. I am satisfied in the circumstances of the case that there is no reason to put the Respondent to its election before hearing the application for a non-suit.\nVI.

He submits that the Complainant has not led any evidence to support the essential allegations in the complaint.\n[2] The Complainant alleges discrimination on two grounds. The first is national or ethnic origin. The second is age. Mr. Filgueira says that Garfield paid him $1.00 less an hour than other employees. It also gave him less overtime.\nII. Preliminary Issues [3] There are two preliminary issues. The first is whether the Complainant withdrew his allegations in the course of giving testimony. The second is whether he should be allowed to return to the witness box to explain his previous testimony.\nA. Was the Complaint Withdrawn? [4] Mr. Capp submitted that the Complainant withdrew his allegations in the course of cross-examination. At one point, he questioned Mr. Filgueira as follows:\nMr. Capp: And in your complaint, sir, part of your complaint is that you\u2019re complaining because the company discriminated against you based on your national or ethnic origin, is that correct?\nMr. Filgueira: I didn\u2019t say that. It could be a possibility or because I did not speak English.\nThis kind of exchange is typical.\n[5] Mr. Filgueira tried to clarify his testimony:\nMr. Filgueira: Initially that was placed there, but then what we thought was that it was really because I didn\u2019t speak English.\nHe then stated:\nMr. Filgueira: I was not sure whether the discrimination was on the basis of my being Chilean or because I did not speak English. Nobody told me.\nAlthough Mr. Filgueira equivocates, in responding to some of the questions, it does not affect the substance of these remarks.\n[6] At a later point in the examination, Mr. Capp asked:\nMr. Capp: And if someone were looking at determining whether or not there was discrimination based upon the country of origin or their ethnic background, you and I can agree that that wouldn\u2019t appear to be the case as far as Garfield Container Transport Inc. is concerned, isn\u2019t that correct?\nMr. Filgueira: Correct.\nThis is in keeping with the rest of the cross-examination. Mr. Filgeuira conceded point after point.\n[7] The cross-examination became a pursuit. When pressed, Mr. Filgueira shifted ground. Mr. Capp followed. If there was no problem with the salary, there was the overtime. He wasn\u2019t given the overtime that he was entitled. Mr. Capp went through the salary records, and forced him to agree that he was paid his overtime. At one point, he agrees that he was not discriminated against on the basis of age. At another point, he agrees that the company did not retaliate against him. Elsewhere, he agrees that other guards were paid a dollar more an hour because they checked the reefer temperatures.\n[8] There is no escaping the reality that much of the Complainant\u2019s testimony contradicts the position he is taking as a party in the hearing. Having said this, I think the Tribunal should proceed cautiously in this kind of situation. After all, it is for the Complainant to decide whether he wants to continue with the case or withdraw the allegations. It is clear that Mr. Filgueira continues to stand by the allegations in the complaint, whatever he testified. In the circumstances, I think it would simply be wrong to say that he has abandoned his case.\nB. Mr. Filgueira\u2019s Hearing [9] During the course of her submissions on the application for a non-suit, Ms. Rubio also advised the Tribunal that Mr. Filgueira had a problem with his hearing. She did not become aware of this until after he had finished his testimony. This would apparently explain the passages in which he appears to withdraw his allegations. Ms. Rubio then suggested that Mr. Filgueira should be allowed to return to the witness box and explain his previous testimony.\n[10] Mr. Capp submitted that it was too late to raise this kind of matter. I have to agree. If there was a problem with Mr. Filgueira\u2019s hearing, it should have been apparent while he was in the witness box. It seems rather convenient to raise it now, in the face of an application to dismiss the case. I think Mr. Filgueira\u2019s testimony was coherent and intelligible. Some of his responses were cryptic. But evidence is always imperfect. The transcript does not raise any serious doubts as to his understanding of the questions that were put to him. He understood the difference, for example, between training and orientation.\n[11] The idea that the Complainant should be allowed to return to the witness box after he closes his case and clarify his previous answers is new to me. The efficiency and fairness of the process is premised on the understanding that the hearing will proceed in an orderly and timely fashion, one witness at a time. The law is full of exceptions, but the whole process would unravel if witnesses were allowed to come back and refurbish their evidence. It would be a mistake to let Mr. Filgueira to return to the witness box.\nIII. Application For Non-Suit [12] A Tribunal that rules on a non-suit should confine itself to the application before it. As a matter of natural justice, it may be necessary to provide reasons or refer in some neutral way to the evidence that is before it. This is a different kind of analysis, however, than the analysis carried out at the end of a hearing. There is no reason to weigh evidence or evaluate the merits of the case.\nA. Law [13] The Respondent has given me case law that deals specifically with the test for a non-suit in an administrative context. In International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 348 v. AGT Ltd. [1997] A.J. No. 1004 (Alta. Q.B.), at para 15, Brooker J. held:\nI am satisfied that the board must correctly apply the no evidence test to a non-suit application. In doing so its function is not to weigh the evidence. Its function is to determine if there is any evidence adduced on the material element in question. The board can only grant a non-suit when it finds that there was no evidence in re\u00adlation to one or more of the essential elements of the grievance.\nThis has been referred to as the any evidence test.\n[14] As it turns out, there is a second test in the jurisprudence. This has been discussed in Gerin v. I.M.P. Group Ltd. (No. 1) (1994), 24 C.H.H.R. D\/449 (NS Bd. Inq.), at para. 24, where Bruce Wildsmith stated:\n... the any evidence standard is probably too low; there must be some reasonable basis on which a conclusion in the complainant\u2019s favour could be reached.\nThe second test accordingly holds that there must be evidence on which a Tribunal could find in favour of the Complainant.\n[15] David Mullan follows the lead of Mr. Wildsmith in Modi v. Paradise Fine Foods Ltd., 2005 HRTO 24, at para. 13, and applies the second test. This is in keeping with the comments of MacIntyre J. in Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28, where he described a prima facie case as:\n\u2026 one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\nThis is not a high threshold and the difference between the two tests is easily exaggerated.\n[16] The decision in Gerin cites an old English case, Ryder v. Wombwell (1868) L.R. 4 Exch. 32 at 38-39, which formulates the test in a manner that seems particularly helpful in the present instance.\n[T]here is in every case \u2026 a preliminary question which is one of law, viz., whether there is any evidence on which the jury could properly find the question for the party on whom the onus of proof lies. If there is not, the judge ought to withdraw the question from the jury and direct a non-suit . . .\n[17] The point I wish to make is that the use of the words any evidence in the context of a non-suit has some limits. The evidence led by the prosecuting party must meet a certain standard. It must be evidence that could be relied upon. I notice that MacIntyre J. writes that a prima facie case must be sufficient. I think the evidence must also be appreciable. There is a threshold below which the probative value of the evidence is so minimal that it has no legal effect.\nB. Allegations (i) Age [18] The Complainant makes two allegations. One is that Mr. Filgueira was discriminated against on the basis of age.\n[19] There is no evidence of this. The only evidence with respect to age is that Mr. Filgueira was older than the other employees. There is also evidence before me that another night watchman may have been paid more. This is not enough.\n[20] I realize that some of the case law suggests that the mere fact that a Complainant in a particular group was treated differently is enough to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. I think this reading of the law would probably empty the process of any meaningful requirement. Since Mr. Filgueira was the oldest employee, any evidence that another employee was paid more would give rise to an inference of discrimination. I think there must be more. There must be a causal connection. There must be evidence that the difference was based on a prohibited ground.\n(ii) National or Ethnic Origin [21] The other allegation in the complaint is that Mr. Filgueira was discriminated against on the basis of his national or ethnic origin. There are two factual allegations here. The first relates to pay-scale; the other to overtime.\n(a) Pay-scale [22] Mr. Filgueira was described as a night watchman. Mr. Capp called him a guard. There were night guards and day guards. Mr. Filgueira alleged that he was paid less than other guards.\n[23] There is an evidentiary matter that requires comment. Ms. Rubio relied on a single salary sheet, which contained pay stub information for Mr. Filgueira and a number of other employees. The parts of this document that relate to other employees were never properly entered into evidence. I have no information as to who these individuals were, what their duties were, or why they were employed. The parts of the document relating to other employees have no weight whatsoever.\n[24] The major problem that Mr. Filgueira faces on the non-suit is that he did not lead evidence to establish the pay-scale for guards. At this point in time, I simply do not know what other guards were paid. There is the testimony of Mr. Beaudoin, but he had additional duties. More to the point, he was not a night watchman. Mr. Beaudoin worked days and the evidence established that the workload was higher during the day.\n[25] The only piece of evidence that might give rise to an inference of discrimination comes from the Complainant himself. Mr. Filgueira testified that Mr. Pahar, another night watchman, said that he was paid a dollar more an hour. Mr. Pahar was slated to testify but did not answer the subpoena. Ms. Rubio decided not to insist on his appearance. I am left with Mr. Filgueira\u2019s testimony.\n[26] The testimony does not establish that Mr. Pahar was paid more for performing the same duties. Mr. Filgueira agreed, in cross-examination, that other gate guards were paid more because they recorded reefer temperatures. Mr. Filgueira did not perform this function. The obvious question is whether Mr. Pahar recorded the reefer temperatures. The evidence does not tell us.\n[27] It is true that Mr. Filgueira testified that he trained Mr. Pahar. This might arguably be construed as evidence that they had the same duties. There are still deficiencies in the record, however. The evidence establishes that Mr. Pahar was East Indian and a member of a minority. It follows that the evidence regarding his pay does not support the allegation that Garfield discriminated against Mr. Filgueira because he was a member of an ethnic minority.\n[28] I suppose it could still be suggested that the employer treated Mr. Filgueira, a Chilean, differently than employees from India. There is a suggestion that Mr. Jasbir, the yard manager, may have been hiring his own people. This is speculation, however. There is no evidence that Mr. Pahar was paid more because he belonged to a particular ethnic group. The complete paucity of evidence on the employer\u2019s practices makes it impossible to say why different wages might be paid.\n(b) Overtime [29] Mr. Filgueira has also alleged that Garfield discriminated against him in awarding overtime. There are two separate claims. The first is that Garfield failed to pay him overtime prior to 2001. The second is that it reduced his overtime, as a result of the present complaint.\n1. Prior to 2001 [30] The first claim requires some explanation of the facts. When Mr. Filgueira was originally hired by Garfield, he worked 72 hours a week. He was not paid overtime. This eventually led to a complaint to Labour Canada regarding the company\u2019s failure to pay overtime.\n[31] The complaint to Labour Canada was subsequently settled. There is a letter from a labour inspector. It is dated June 1, 2001 and states that Mr. Filgueira is entitled to $13,104.00 for unpaid overtime.\n[32] The final paragraph of the letter states:\nAs required by Section 251(2) [of the Canada Labour Code], please indicate by your signature below that the amount stated above, when deposited into your RRSP, is the full amount owed to you for overtime worked to this date.\nThis is followed by a signature line.\n[33] There is no reason to go any further into the details of the matter. Subsection 251(2) of the Canada Labour Code states that the employer and employee must agree on the amount owed. Mr. Filgueira accepted the figure in the letter as full payment of the overtime. Ms. Rubio acknowledged at the outset of the hearing that the monetary claim for overtime prior to 2001 had been settled. She nevertheless submitted that the company\u2019s failure to pay the overtime was evidence of discrimination.\n[34] The problem is that there is no evidence that the failure to pay overtime was discriminatory in a legal sense. The only evidence before me was that Mr. Filgueira had a conversation with an officer of the company, who said that the company did not pay overtime. But there is no real information relating to other employees. There is nothing in the evidence that would demonstrate that Mr. Filgueira was treated differently than employees in other national or ethnic groups.\n2. Retaliation [35] There is also an allegation of retaliation. There are two versions of this allegation. The first is that the company retaliated against Mr. Filgueira because he filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code. The second is that it retaliated against him because he filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.\n[36] The fundamental factual assertion is that Mr. Filgueira\u2019s overtime was reduced after the previous claim was settled. There is no evidence of this. Mr. Capp went through Mr. Filgueira\u2019s salary record laboriously, paycheque by paycheque. Mr. Filgueira was forced to agree that he worked 80 hours a week during 2001, 2002 and 2003. This was what he was working before the complaint was filed.\n[37] I should add that the information relating to other employees is completely lacking. There is no evidence that Mr. Filgueira was treated differently than employees in different national or ethnic groups.\n(c) Conclusions [38] The fundamental requirement on this side of the case is relatively simple. The Complainant must lead some evidence that Garfield treated Mr. Filgueira differently than employees in other national or ethnic groups. The matter is complicated by the fact that Mr. Filgueira changed his position in the course of his testimony and suggested that the real basis of any discrimination was language. I nevertheless agree in the present case that this would be enough to establish discrimination on the basis of national origin.\n[39] I think the exchanges in cross-examination demonstrate the speculative nature of the claim before me. Mr. Filgueira believed he was being paid less than other employees. On the basis of this fact, he assumed that he was being discriminated against. This was an assumption. Mr. Filgueira was not particularly interested in the reason why he was being treated differently. But of course this is precisely what concerns the Tribunal.\n[40] The only evidence before me is Mr. Pahar\u2019s remark that he was making a dollar more an hour. Mr. Filgueira was upset by the remark and assumed that he was being discriminated against. I suppose this is within the realm of possibility. But there must be some proof of this. By proof in law we mean something that makes it more likely than not that a particular claim is true. There must be something in the evidence that would support a conclusion in the Complainant\u2019s favour.\n[41] The question that I am left with is this: if an employee believes that someone in a different ethnic group is doing the same job, and receiving a higher wage, is that enough to establish a prima facie case of discrimination? I think there must be something more. There must be something in the evidence, independent of the Complainant\u2019s beliefs, which confirms his suspicions. I am not saying that a Complainant\u2019s beliefs do not have any evidentiary weight. It depends on the circumstances. But an abstract belief that a person is discriminated against, without some fact to confirm that belief, is not enough.\n[42] There are always possibilities. This is not sufficient. Proof is something more than a bare possibility. I see nothing in the evidence before me that makes this possibility real or introduces a measurable degree of probability into the equation.\n[43] I am left with a single statement from Mr. Pahar, who was never called as a witness. I think this evidence falls well below the standard needed to sustain a legal claim. If there is any evidence before me, it is not appreciable. It is so minimal that it has no effect in law.\nIV. Ruling [44] The test for a non-suit has been met. The application for a non-suit is granted and the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario August 17, 2005\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T952\/7204\nStyle of Cause: Ronaldo Filgueira v.

He has requested a formal order directing the Respondent to pay the costs awarded in my previous decision. The Respondent has objected.\n[2] Section 57 of the Canadian Human Rights Act states:\n57. An order under section 53 or 54 may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court by following the usual practice and procedure or by the Commission filing in the Registry of the Court a copy of the order certified to be a true copy.\n[3] I realize that sections 53 and 54 do not refer specifically to costs. I cannot see that it matters. The normal way of enforcing a decision of the Tribunal is to prepare a formal order, which can be filed with the Federal Court.\n[4] I agree with Mr. Bagambiire that the issuance of a formal order is an administrative act, which probably comes within the powers of any adjudicative body. The only reason for such an order is to provide a convenient summary of the terms of the award. This provides a clear direction to the public officers charged with executing the award.\n[5] Mr. Bagambiire goes further, however, and suggests that the Complainant has a common law right to such an order, subject to any objections to its form and content. I am inclined to agree with him. The order adds nothing to my previous ruling and simply declares that a certain decision has been made. It would be capricious to award the Complainant a remedy and then deny him the documentation that he needs to collect it.\n[6] There is another issue, however. Ms. Cameron acts for the Respondent. She has confirmed that the Respondent is seeking a review of my earlier ruling that the Tribunal has the power to award costs. As it turns out, the same question is presently before the Federal Court in another case. Ms. Cameron says that the situation is uncertain. She is uncomfortable with the idea that the Complainant would attempt to execute a formal order while my authority to issue it is under attack.\n[7] I agree with the Respondent that it would be better to see what the Court rules before the Complainant tries to execute the order. Having said this, I have come to the conclusion that this aspect of the matter is out of my hands. It seems to me that Mr. Bagambiire is right in saying that I have an obligation to follow my own ruling, and remain steadfast, until such time as the Federal Court rules otherwise. I would be changing my mind if I refused the order.\n[8] The order will accordingly issue.\nSigned by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nAugust 31, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT838\/8803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCecil Brooks v.

Grant Sinclair, Pierre Deschamps\n2005 CHRT 34 2005\/09\/15\n[1] This motion is the most recent of a series of motions by Bell for the production\/disclosure of documents.\n[2] In its remedy claim, the complainants, CEP and Femmes-Action, are asking for $1,000 per year, under s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, for the pain and suffering experienced by each employee in a CEP female-dominated job class, from February 11, 1990 (or the date they became an employee, if such date is later) until the date of the final Tribunal decision. CEP and Femmes-Action allege that these employees experienced pain and suffering because of the failure of Bell to implement the joint pay equity study and make wage adjustments.\n[3] To substantiate its claims, the CEP will call as witnesses, six or seven former Bell operators. These witnesses will provide evidence of a representative nature in respect of injury to dignity and self-respect, financial hardship, stress and frustration caused to them, other bargaining unit members and, in some cases their families.\n[4] Bell's request for disclosure is extraordinary in its scope. Bell asks that these witnesses and their respective spouse(s) or partner(s) produce up-to-date documents showing income, expenses, assets, liabilities for the period extending from February 11, 1990 to the present. More specifically:\ntax returns; agreements for credit cards, loans, mortgages, lines of credit and other sources of finance used or available and monthly and\/or annual statements related thereto; any documents showing dates of birth and retirement, date(s) of marriage(s), cohabitation(s), separation(s), divorce(s), birth of any child and showing any arrangement, agreement or court order for the sharing of income, maintenance, expenses, assets and liabilities such as child support and\/or spousal support; any financial statements prepared either for the purposes of applying for financing, for personal or other use; documents showing or relating to any other matters or circumstances having a material effect on the financial circumstances of each witness, including but not limited to, serious illness, accident, fire, choice of vacation destinations and other personal travel.\n[5] Bell argues that the documents are arguably relevant and required for an understanding of the financial circumstances of each witness during the period in question, so that Bell can conduct a proper cross-examination.\n[6] Bell also wants to use the financial circumstances of the CEP witnesses to challenge the expert opinion of Dr. Gould as to the appropriate interest rate on any monetary compensation that the Tribunal may award.\n[7] CEP objects to the disclosure\/production of these documents because they are not arguably relevant, they are an unnecessary intrusion into the private life of the proposed witnesses, and these documents or records are privileged and confidential. The Commission takes no position on Bell's motion.\n[8] In addition to its argument of necessity, Bell also put forward the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in Smith & Nephew Inc. v. Glegg, 2005 SCC 31 in support of its demands.\n[9] Glegg did not deal with financial disclosure. It dealt with disclosure of psychiatric medical records. During her examination for discovery, the plaintiff revealed that she had consulted a psychiatrist about 40 times. The defendants argued that the psychiatrist's medical records were relevant and necessary for a full and proper defence. They sought production. The plaintiff objected.\n[10] In its reasons, the Supreme Court paid particular attention to the provisions of the Qubec Civil Code and the Qubec Charter of Human Rights and Freedom. This aspect of its reasons is not relevant here.\n[11] What is relevant is the Court's Requirement of relevance portion of its decision. On the question of relevance, the Supreme Court noted that a defendant must show not that the evidence is relevant in the traditional sense, but that disclosure of the document will be useful, is appropriate, is likely to contribute to advancing the debate and is based on an acceptable objective that he or she seeks to attain in the case, and that the document is related to the dispute (at para. 23).\n[12] As we noted earlier, Bell's request is inordinately over-reaching. For example, Bell asks the Tribunal to order third parties, i.e. spouses or partners to produce certain documents. We have no jurisdiction to make such an order.\n[13] Further, Bell's motion may require that the witnesses, spouses or partners create documents that do not already exist. We can not require this.\n[14] Another example of over-reaching is Bell's request that the witnesses produce documents showing or relating to any other matters or circumstances having a material effect on the financial circumstances of each witness. This request amounts to the proverbial fishing expedition. It lacks specificity and requires the witnesses to make a determination of whether any document in the past 15 years has had a material effect on their financial circumstances.\n[15] The issue for the Tribunal on pain and suffering is two-fold. First, did the complainants suffer any pain and suffering because of Bell's refusal to make wage adjustments; and, secondly, if so, what is the quantum of damages that should be awarded.\n[16] In their will say statements, CEP's witnesses allege that Bell's refusal to fully address the wage gap has negatively impaired their financial circumstances. This has had certain consequences. For example, some could not make ends meet; some were not able to provide hockey or dance lessons for their children; some had to cash in RRSP's to better assist in their children's education; some could not afford braces for the children's teeth, etc. As a result, they experienced pain and suffering to the tune of $1,000 per witness per year for a number of years.\n[17] In making this claim for compensation, the complainants are not asking for compensation for financial loss. Rather, their claim is that the alleged financial hardship led to the witnesses experiencing pain and suffering.\n[18] The onus is on the complainants to establish this link. It is not on Bell to disprove this. In our opinion, the productions sought by Bell would not be useful or advance the debate before the Tribunal. Rather, the cross-examination of these witnesses under oath would provide a more useful evidentiary basis for the Tribunal to decide whether or not the witnesses did experience pain and suffering and if so, what, if any, is the appropriate amount of compensation.\n[19] As for Bell's argument that it needs these productions to deal with Dr. Gould's expert opinion, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Gould's evidence dealt essentially with the question of the appropriate rate of interest to be applied to any compensation that may be awarded by the Tribunal.\n[20] Dr. Gould's evidence was general in nature. He did not consider the specific financial circumstances of any of the CEP members. In fact, he opined that the individual financial circumstances of the CEP members were not relevant.\n[21] For Dr. Gould, it was not important to know where each of the complainants lived, their level of debt, their spending habits, their family situation, etc.\n[22] Given the financial information he had about the group, i.e. individuals earning between $27,000 - $32,000 annually, Dr. Gould was able to conclude that, as a group, they all had some debt.\n[23] Dr. Gould's general conclusion as to whether CEP members, Bell telephone operators, had mortgages, consumer loans or credit cards can be easily tested by cross-examination of the CEP witnesses.\n[24] Further, the validity of any general assumptions or conclusions, rather than specific circumstances, made by Dr. Gould can be refuted by expert evidence from Bell.\n[25] Bell's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by J.

Introduction\nII. Preliminary Matters\nIII. The Complainant\u2019s Witness, Marshall Schecter\nIV. The Facts\nV. The Decision\nVI. Conclusion\nI. Introduction [1] On August 31, 2002, Benjamin Schecter (the Complainant) filed a complaint against the Canadian National Railway Company (the Respondent). He alleges that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of disability by failing to accommodate his relatives and himself in the provision of facilities contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] What should have been a very simple matter, unfortunately turned into a confrontational and, at times, aggressive hearing. The ill-feelings and the deep-rooted distrust of the parties towards one another was very apparent and made any logical approach to find a solution difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, throughout the hearing, the Complainant, BenjaminSchecter, during that part of the hearing in which he participated, and Counsel for the Respondent, Mr. William G. McMurray, acted respectfully towards the Tribunal and towards the other persons present at the hearing.\n[3] The interruptions and disturbances during these proceedings were mainly the responsibility of the Complainant\u2019s son and witness, Mr. Marshall Schecter. On numerous occasions, he showed disrespect towards the Tribunal and challenged its orders. He did not take lightly to any arguments or opinions which would differ from what he perceived to be the facts or the law. I will, during this decision, elaborate and comment on these circumstances, which eventually culminated in the Complainant leaving the hearing at the insistence of his son. The attitude of Marshall Schecter certainly did not help the Complainant\u2019s case and prevented him from explaining and presenting, in a reasoned and logical manner, the events which brought him before the Tribunal.\n[4] The Complainant, Benjamin Schecter, is a Queen\u2019s Counsel and a member of the Quebec Bar. He is also a retired judge having served previously on the Quebec Court, criminal division. Moreover he served as a Member of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for a period of ten years, retiring a few months before this hearing. I had never met the Complainant before this hearing, nor did I find out before being appointed to hear the case, that he was a former Member of the Tribunal.\n[5] The Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s participation in this hearing was very limited. At the start of the hearing, Mr. Patrick O\u2019Rourke, Counsel for the Commission, informed the Tribunal that the Commission had entered into an agreement with the Respondent which would settle, to the satisfaction of the Commission, the public interest issues in this matter. The Commission saw no need to further participate in the hearing and it informed the Tribunal of its intention to withdraw from the proceedings.\nII. Preliminary Matters [6] At the outset, the Respondent raised some preliminary issues which I dealt with orally during the hearing. The Complainant also raised an issue relating to the issuance of subpoenas to witnesses. I will now formally address these issues.\n[7] In a preliminary motion, the Respondent sought an order that the complaint be dismissed on a summary basis. The reasons for this request were threefold: the Complainant had not adhered to the disclosure process of the Tribunal; the issue of public interest which had been referred to the Tribunal by the Commission had been resolved; and the facts set out in the complaint did not disclose any matters which should be determined by the Tribunal.\n[8] In order to dispose of this preliminary motion, it would be appropriate to review some correspondence exchanged between the parties, the Commission and the Tribunal.\n[9] The President of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Act, requested, on January 6, 2004, that the Acting Chairperson, as he then was, of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint, as she was satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry was warranted.\n[10] On January 27, 2004, the Commission advised the Tribunal that its disclosure of documents in this matter had been sent to the Complainant and to the Respondent. The Tribunal informed the parties, on March 18, 2004, that the case would proceed to hearing and that they were entitled to present evidence and make legal submissions in support of their arguments before the Tribunal. The parties were also provided with copies of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure governing the practices of the Tribunal, a Tribunal\u2019s publication entitled What happens next? A Guide to the Tribunal Process and a questionnaire to assist the Tribunal with the planning of the inquiry. The parties were asked to respond in writing to the questionnaire and were instructed to send a copy of the completed questionnaire to the other parties and to the Tribunal before April 8, 2004.\n[11] On April 19, 2004, the Tribunal received a faxed copy of the Complainant\u2019s questionnaire. In the section of the questionnaire entitled Remedies sought, the Complainant wrote Forcing principally to provide adequate parking facility at its stations, especially Central Station in Montreal, for handicapped persons. Further down in section 5 of the questionnaire, it was added in writing Damages to be considered. The Respondent\u2019s questionnaire was filed on April26,2004.\n[12] The Tribunal, as a result of the answers to its questionnaire, issued directions on June2,2004, pertaining to the scheduling of dates for the inquiry and disclosure. The Commission was directed to provide each party with a copy of its file by June 22, 2004. Pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, the Complainant and the Commission were directed to provide full disclosure by July 16, 2004 and the Respondent was directed to provide its disclosure by August 10, 2004. Furthermore, the parties were made aware of Rule 9(3), which explains that no previously undisclosed issue or evidence is to be led at the hearing Except with leave of the [presiding member] \u2026 and subject to a party\u2019s right to lead evidence in reply.\n[13] The parties were further advised that disclosure includes exchange between them of the documentary evidence and witness lists with will-say statements. It was also indicated that disclosure consist of not only documents a party intends to introduce as evidence at the hearing but those documents arguably relevant to the proceedings, whether or not a party intends to file them as evidence.\n[14] The parties were also instructed to provide brief written particulars to outline the issues and the evidence that they would submit to the Tribunal. These particulars were to be filed with the Tribunal and copied to all parties by the deadlines which had been fixed.\n[15] On August 13, 2004, the Complainant forwarded a letter to the Tribunal in which he named five potential witnesses but he did not provide will-say statements for these witnesses. That list did not include the Complainant, his wife or his son, Marshall Schecter. On page 2 of the letter, the Complainant listed the remedies and compensatory damages that he would be seeking at the hearing.\n[16] The Respondent wrote to the Tribunal on August 17, 2004. It referred to the Complainant\u2019s letter of August 13, 2004, and stated that this letter did not constitute proper disclosure and proceeded to list a series of questions that it wanted addressed. On August19,2004, the Respondent served on the other parties its list of proposed witnesses and documents.\n[17] On August 23, 2004, a letter was sent to the Tribunal by Mr. Marshall Schecter, the son of the Complainant, in which he objected to certain documents contained in the Respondent\u2019s list. He also provided further details concerning the compensatory remedies the Complainant would be seeking at the hearing and the list of his witnesses. He also indicated that the Complainant would be calling his wife and son as witnesses at the hearing.\n[18] I will now address separately each of the issues raised by the Respondent in its preliminary motion. I will deal first with the issues of witnesses and disclosure of documents. According to Rule 6(1)f) of the Rules of Procedure of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, a party must not only list the names of the persons he wishes to call as witnesses but he must also provide in his disclosure a summary of their testimony. The Complainant never provided this summary for the witnesses he listed in his August 13, 2004 letter. In his August 23, 2004 letter, the Complainant suggested that he also intended to call his wife and his son as witnesses but he did not provide summaries of their testimony.\n[19] It should have come as no surprise to the Respondent that these two witnesses would be called by the Complainant taking into consideration their close connection to the matters raised in the complaint. Even though a summary was not provided, the Respondent, with the information it had, was definitely in a position to anticipate the substance of their testimony. The purpose of a will-say statement is to prevent the other party from being taken by surprise when the hearing starts. I do not believe that this was the case in regards to these two witnesses and, no prejudice having been caused to the Respondent by the absence of the summary, I ruled that this objection was unfounded.\n[20] In regards to the other witnesses listed by the Complainant, no summary was provided for them. It is for these witnesses that the Complainant requested subpoenas. According to section 50(3)a) of the Act, only those witnesses whose testimony are necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint will be issued a subpoena and ordered to appear at the hearing of the complaint. With no will-say statement for these witnesses and no reasonable explanation for this failure to respect the rules of the Tribunal, I was not in a position to assess the relevancy of their proposed evidence.\n[21] It is also important to understand that the issuance of a subpoena by the Tribunal is not an administrative act. The Tribunal has discretion in the decision to issue or not a subpoena. Section 50(3)(a) of the Act states that a member may issue a subpoena if the member considers it necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint. (CTEA v. Bell Canada, T503\/ 2098, ruling #2). Accordingly, not being in a position to consider if they were necessary, I refused to issue the subpoenas. I must add that a Tribunal hearing is not a fishing expedition and unless there is a relevant connection between the evidence which is sought from the witnesses for whom subpoenas are required and the matter before the Tribunal, subpoenas will not be issued.\n[22] I will now address the issue relating to the disclosure of documents. The Tribunal\u2019s primary obligations as it relates to disclosure lies in the need to protect the fairness and integrity of the process. This generally requires full and ample disclosure by the parties. Any exception should be seen as a qualification carved out of the general rule.\n[23] Under Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure a Complainant who intends to lead evidence or who wishes to adopt a position which differs from that of the Canadian Human Rights Commission must provide in writing:\nThe material facts which he will seek to prove in support of his case. The legal issues raised in the case, including the nature of the discrimination alleged. The relief which it seeks. All documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which no privilege is claimed All documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which privilege is claimed including the grounds for the claim. The witnesses it intends to call, including expert witnesses identified as such, and a summary of their testimony.\n[24] The rules do provide remedy if a party tries to rely on a document which has not been disclosed. Rule 9(3) provides that if a party does not produce a document which is relevant, that party will not be able to introduce that document into evidence at the hearing except with leave of the Tribunal. Unless the Respondent can establish that the presentation of its case would be jeopardized by the failure of the Complainant to disclose the documents, I see no reason to dismiss the case on this basis. The remedy provided by the rule is sufficient, in my opinion, to cure the defect of non disclosure. If a document not disclosed by the Complainant was deemed essential to the Respondent\u2019s case, the Tribunal would order its production.\n[25] I fail to see how the allegations of improper disclosure raised by the Respondent could justify an order dismissing the complaint. These procedural requirements are there to protect the fairness and integrity of the process. The Complainant is an officer of the court and a former Member of the Tribunal and he is well aware of the procedures of the Tribunal and he will not be surprised if he is adversely affected if he does not respect them.\n[26] In regards to the issue of damages, section 53 of the Act provides what remedies are available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, should his or her complaint be substantiated. In this case, that person is the Complainant, Benjamin Schecter. In his disclosure dated August13,2004, the Complainant referred to the remedies he was seeking. The question of whether these would be available to him depends on his ability to present relevant evidence as to the damages that the alleged discriminatory practice of the Respondent caused him. In his questionnaire and disclosure, he also referred to policy remedies which are self explanatory and to compensatory damages which seem to refer to section 53(2)(e) of the Act. I emphasize that these compensatory damages, if any, would be those of the victim, in this case the Complainant.\n[27] With regards to the second question raised by the Respondent to the effect that the only issue before the Tribunal was the policy issue identified by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, it would be important to clear up some confusion regarding the respective roles of the Commission and the Tribunal.\n[28] The Commission is not an adjudicative body; that is the role of the Tribunal. When deciding whether a complaint should proceed to be inquired into by the Tribunal, the Commission fulfils a screening analysis. It is not the job of the Commission to determine if the complaint is made out. Rather its duty is to decide if, under the provisions of the Act, an inquiry is warranted having regard to all the facts. The central component of the Commission's role, then, is that of assessing the sufficiency of the evidence before it.\n[29] The main function of the Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission. It has many of the powers of a court. It is empowered to find facts, to interpret and apply the law to the facts before it, and to award appropriate remedies. Moreover, its hearings have much the same structure as a formal trial before a court. The parties before the Tribunal lead evidence, call and cross-examine witnesses, and make submissions on how the law should be applied to the facts. The Tribunal is not involved in crafting policy, nor does it undertake its own independent investigations of complaints: the investigative and policy-making functions have deliberately been assigned by the legislature to a different body, the Commission.\n[30] The Commission refers complaints to the Tribunal. That is exactly what it did in its letter of January 6, 2004. It is clear upon reading the letter from the Commission to the Tribunal\u2019s then Acting Chairperson that all aspects of the complaint were referred to the Tribunal. As my colleague, Member Hadjis, so clearly pointed out in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Attorney General of Canada, 2003 CHRT 32, one must not lose sight of the fact that although the Commission has the authority to decide whether a complaint is to be referred to the Tribunal (ss. 44(3) and 49 of the Act), the complaint continues to remain the Complainant\u2019s, not the Commission\u2019s.\n[31] Once it receives a complaint, the Tribunal, in accordance with section 50(2) of the Act, decide[s] all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter. In this case, whatever was the intention of the Commission regarding the complaint or the remedies, once it has referred it to the Tribunal, the Commission becomes but one of the parties in the process.\n[32] This brings me to the third issue relating to some inconsistencies in the complaint, which according to the Respondent illustrates that there is no issue before the Tribunal. I am of the opinion that there is an issue to be heard by the Tribunal and this issue is whether the Complainant has been able to establish that he has been discriminated against by reason of the failure of the Respondent to provide facilities that could accommodate his deficiency.\n[33] The request by the Respondent that this matter be dismissed on a summary basis is therefore dismissed.\nIII. The Complainant\u2019s Witness, Marshall Schecter [34] Before dealing with the issues, I feel that it is important that I comment on the behaviour of the Complainant\u2019s witness and son, Marshall Schecter. At the hearing, the Complainant chose to call only two witnesses in addition to himself. These witnesses were his wife, Mrs.IrmaSchecter, and his son, Mr. Marshall Schecter. The latter was the important witness for the Complainant, as he was in his words perhaps the only person who can recite the facts [\u2026] which took place on the evening in question. Unfortunately for the Complainant, Mr.MarshallSchecter did not live up to that expectation. By his demeanour, short temper, enmity towards not only the opposing Counsel but also towards the Chairperson, his untimely interventions and numerous disruptions during the hearing, he became a very unreliable witness.\n[35] On the first day of the hearing, the Complainant indicated that, being a lawyer, he would represent himself. This did not stop Mr. Marshall Schecter from interfering in the proceedings and acting as if this was his complaint. The Tribunal, although it could have limited his participation decided, in the erroneous belief that this would facilitate the hearing, to allow him to make representations on behalf of his father. Knowing what it knows now, the decision of the Tribunal might today be different.\n[36] At the start of the hearing, Marshall Schecter intervened to indicate that documentation provided to the parties by the Tribunal had not been received by him. The Tribunal\u2019s files indicate that the letter in question dated March 18, 2004 was sent, with the accompanying documents, to the Complainant\u2019s address.\n[37] Again, on the first day, during the Respondent\u2019s arguments on its preliminary motions, Mr.Marshall Schecter interrupted Counsel and said: Excuse me. Are we going to be listening to this, or are you supposed to be ruling on this. Because he is presenting his case at this point in time. At another time, he accused opposing Counsel of not telling the truth and called him a liar. He also characterised a potential witness of the Respondent as a bigot.\n[38] On August 31, 2004, the second day of the hearing, the issue of disclosure of documents came up. The Respondent requested copies of various documents which were referred to in the Complainant\u2019s disclosure. One particular document sought to be produced was a letter signed by Mr. Marshall Schecter addressed to Mr. Charles Unterberg of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It referred to pertinent information concerning \u2026 the complaint at Central Station in Montreal on June 7. It then proceeded to list four letters and gave the number of pages attached to those letters. One of those letters was on the letterhead of the law firm Berkovitz and Strauber, and it was signed by the Complainant. It indicated that there were documents enclosed with it. The Respondent was asking that copies of these attached documents be provided.\n[39] Marshall Schecter at first indicated that he was in the process of moving and that a lot of these documents were in storage and he might not be able to find them. The Tribunal indicated that these documents would have to be produced by September 2, 2004 or an explanation why they could not be produced would have to be given. After a short adjournment, Marshall Schecter returned and indicated that these documents could not be produced on September 2, 2004, because his printer had told him that he could not do the copies by that time.\n[40] The Tribunal then proceeded to order that on Thursday September 2, 2004, the documents with the necessary copies be produced. The following exchange then ensued:\nMr. M. Schecter : Excuse me. I am sorry to interject. I cannot comply with it. I \u2013\nThe Chairperson : Well, then at that point \u2013\nMr. M. Schecter : Excuse me. May I finish, please. I called the printer, they \u2013\nThe Chairperson : There are ---\nMr. M. Schecter : I called Banner Blueprint who I use for my architecture, I know these people. I have been dealing with them for 20 years. It will take at least three days to get them, if I bring them over this evening. I can\u2019t get them done any quicker, and I\u2019m putting myself on Record.\nThe Chairperson : I am also a lawyer, and I have been asked to do things on very short notice, and it was done. There are more than one copier in the City of Montreal, I\u2019m sure. [\u2026] My Order is that those documents be exchanged onThursday morning. If not, I will adjourn at that time.\nMr. M. Schecter : Then I ask for an adjourn\u2014\nThe Chairperson : This is my Order.\nMr. M. Schecter : Then I ask to \u2013 if we could have it postponed until next week, please?\nThe Chairperson : It won\u2019t be postponed until next week. It will bepostponed until the parties have done full disclosure, and then we will see what dates will be set.\nMr. M. Schecter : Then I suggest we do that right now, please.\nThe Chairperson : Then this will be adjourned sine die.\nMr. B. Schecter : May I have \u2013 may I have a word,\u2026[\u2026] Mr. Chair. I am aware of the difficulties which my son has mentioned to the Tribunal, and I want to tell you one thing, he acts in most cases, as fast as any human being can, and I know that it will be physically impossible to have everything that we are discussing now to be prepared on Thursday. He checked on the telephone, and \u2013 it is not an effort to conceal or to delay anything.\nThe Chairperson : I know that, Mr. Schecter. But, we are talking about one copy at this point of those documents to be produced.\nMr. M. Schecter : One or six is the same.\nThe Chairperson : Well, six copies will be when the evidence will beintroduced in front of the Tribunal. We are not there yet. We are talking about one copy to be provided to the other party. I will be back here on Thursday morning, and if the parties are not ready at that time to provide those documents, I willadjourn this matter, and wait until all proper \u2013 I will not accept \u2013 this Tribunal is an important Tribunal, and you know that, Mr. Schecter.\nMr. B. Schecter : Oh, yes. Indeed.\nThe Chairperson : You understand that this case, will not be turned into something that it is not. It is a judicial proceeding, and we will respect the rules of the Tribunal. At that point, I am suggesting that these documents be exchanged on Thursday morning. There is 48 hours. If it cannot be done, then it will be adjourned.\n[\u2026]\nMr. M. Schecter : For all documents. They cannot be done.\nThe Chairperson : Your son has the list of the documents that we arereferring to. So, I will be back here on Thursday morning, and we will see where the parties are at. So, this concludes the matter for today, unless there areother issues.\n[\u2026]\nMr. M. Schecter : [\u2026] I just want to mention on the Record that I will not be able to provide all the documentation.\nThe Chairperson : Well, you will explain to the Tribunal at that time why you are not able to provide those documents on the 2nd. But we will reconvene on the 2nd and we will see where we are at.\n[41] The documents were produced and provided to the Respondent on Thursday, September2, 2004, as ordered.\n[42] On September 3, 2004, a motion was filed by the Respondent regarding the production of other documents which had been filed with the Bureau d\u2019\u00e9thique professionnelle of the City of Longueil Police Service, concerning agents Greffard and Sauv\u00e9, and the events of June 7, 2001 at CN Central Station. Mr. Marshall Schecter objected to the production of these documents arguing that the information contained in them was privileged under the Young Offenders Act, S.C., c. Y-1 [Repealed, 2002, c. 1, s. 199.]. These events had been raised in the complaint and in a letter addressed to the Tribunal on August 13, 2004 by Mr. Marshall Schecter.\n[43] In the complaint they were referred to as follows:\nAt this time, my wife and grandson were confronted by Montreal UrbanCommunity (MUC) policemen. One of the policemen grabbed mygrandson, threatened him, shoved his knee violently in my grandson\u2019s back and slapped his face several times\u2026\nMy son [Marshall Schecter] tried to intervene but another policeman pushed him brutally.\nMy wife was in shock and in tears and tried to obtain explanation from thepolicemen who became very aggressive; one of the policemen punched her in the chest and another pinched her left arm.\n[44] Again in a letter dated August 13, 2004, signed by Mr. Marshall Schecter as [representative] of [his] family\u2019s interest under the heading Compensatory Damages, we read:\nFor the cruel and brutal beating, and arrest of my son, and assault charge laid against him, a minor, initiated by C.N. and an ex employee of C.N, to create leverage inorder to abandon our case. The assault case against my minor son was later dropped by the Crown.\nFor the physical and vicious assault against my Mother and myself, and the needless pushing my Father (handicapped) into a paddy wagon by 4 black gloved C.N.Security Guards plus 4 police officers. The psychological pressures which have affected my entire family, the arrogance of C.N., the denigration and lack of respect against my family, and particularly my Father who has a stellar reputation in Law for 65 years. Also, the constant harassment by C.N. until the present day.\nThe compensatory damages sought is the maximum prescribed by law under the Commission\u2019s sic power, multiplied by four, that is my son, Mother, Father andmyself.\n[45] These events having been raised by the Complainant to justify his request for compensatory damages, documents concerning them became arguably relevant and had to be disclosed unless they were privileged. Having heard the parties\u2019 arguments on this matter, the Tribunal proceeded to order that the document filed with the Bureau d\u2019\u00e9thique professionnelle of the City of Longueil Police Service concerning agents Greffard and Sauv\u00e9, and the events of June 7, 2001 at CN Central Station be disclosed and, in order to address the concerns of the Complainant concerning his grandson, I ordered that any information concerning a minor which might be included in that document be removed. It was further ordered that the Respondent consult the document for the purpose of this hearing only and that it not disclose its content to anyone other than its Legal Counsel.\n[46] At this point, Mr. Marshall Schecter became very aggressive and voiced strongly his intention not to comply with this order to a point where his father had to interject and tell him That\u2019s enough. Later on during the day, this whole matter concerning compensatory damages for the Complainant and his family was resolved when the Complainant acknowledged that the only person who could ask for compensatory damages was himself, if his claim was substantiated. The claim for compensatory damages referred to in Mr. Marshall Schecter\u2019s letter of August13,2004 for his mother, his son and himself was dropped by the Complainant.\n[47] Later on during that same day, Mr. Marshall Schecter objected to the presence in the room of a gentleman from the Police Department saying that he did not want him in the hearing. The following exchange followed:\nThe Chairperson : Are you asking for an exclusion of witnesses?\nMr. M. Schecter : I\u2019m asking for his exclusion because we haven\u2019t accepted him as a witness yet -- because this is a situation pertaining to [redacted] again and [redacted] is relevant in there and it is against the Young Offenders Act.\nThe Chairperson : Mr. Schecter, it\u2019s a public hearing. Unless you ask for an exclusion of witnesses, it\u2019s a public\u2026\nMr. M. Schecter : Well this is Mr. \u2013 are you Mr. Des\u00e8ve? Well if he\u2019s Mr. Des\u00e8ve, his name is one of the witnesses.\nThe Chairperson : Are you asking for an exclusion of witnesses?\nMr. M. Schecter : I\u2019m asking for his exclusion in this courtroom.\nThe Chairperson : I\u2019m not going to exclude one witness. Are you asking for an exclusion of witnesses?\nMr. M. Schecter : Well, why should he be able to come into this testimony since he wasn\u2019t there, he has nothing to do with the situation but he\u2019s bringing a document in, again, against [redacted]. So what I would suggest we do at this point, if you don\u2019t mind me saying, and I\u2019m not a lawyer but I want to put forth, and let\u2019s discuss the Young Offenders Act. I don\u2019t want to argue but I\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s pertaining because he\u2019s put it in evidence and I\u2019ve seen that document from the Crown. So we\u2019re going back again and I never gave it to CN.\nThe Chairperson : If they are documents pertaining to [redacted] that they will be trying to produce in evidence, you\u2019ll be able to raise those objections then. This morning when I\u2019m talking about disclosure of documents, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re in evidence.\nMr. M. Schecter : I\u2019m not going to sit here for days after day and talk about [redacted], okay. [\u2026] Well, we came down here to testify. Either we testify or we leave. Please let us know and let\u2019s get on with the case.\n[48] The Complainant was then asked to call his first witness, Mr. Marshall Schecter again interjected:\nMr. M. Schecter : Well then, go ahead. They wanted to call my father.\nThe Chairperson : No, it\u2019s your \u2013it\u2019s your case, Mr. Schecter.\n[\u2026]\nMr. B. Schecter : Well, that\u2019s up to me then because I\u2019m the Counsel here and whether or not I will wear two hats later on is another matter but I\u2019m Counsel and we\u2019re ready to \u2013 we\u2019re ready to start.\nMr. M. Schecter : One of the reasons we cannot call any witnesses because we were precluded by CN and the Police Department from getting any witnesses.\nMr. B. Schecter : Well, that will come in evidence\u2026\nMr. M. Schecter : Exactly. So right now we have nobody to call.\n[49] Notwithstanding his son\u2019s comments, the Complainant then proceeded to present his evidence.\n[50] On September 10, 2004 there was another strong intervention by Mr. Marshall Schecter regarding a line of questioning from Respondent Counsel that he found disrespectful towards his father. His father then indicated to his son that if there were any objections to be made that he would make them. He also stated that sometimes his son gets a little overzealous in his protection of him.\n[51] On September 23, 2004, during his mother\u2019s testimony, Mr. Marshall Schecter again interrupted the proceedings and proceeded to explain the evidence given by his mother concerning the physical layout of an apartment building in which the Complainant and she had lived. According to Mr. Marshall Schecter, he had the right to object since Counsel for the Respondent was giving erroneous information. The Chair had to explain to Mr.MarshallSchecter that his father was representing himself and that if he so wished, he could in reply ask the witness to correct the information if it was erroneous.\n[52] The hearing adjourned on September 23, 2004 and only reconvened on May 9, 2005. On that day, Marshall Schecter was the Complainant\u2019s witness. He was a most recalcitrant witness and, at times, aggressive and antagonistic.\n[53] In actual fact, what infuriated the witness was my questioning as to where he was parked on the day of June 7, 2001. The witness did not seem to realise that the adjudicative process in our adversarial system relies on viva voce testimony adduced from witnesses examined before the trier of facts, in this case, the Presiding Member of the Tribunal. In general terms, it is the role of the parties, not the Tribunal, to call and examine witnesses. While the presentation of evidence is left to the parties and Counsel, the trier of facts has the right to question witnesses. In fact, I would add that it is its duty to do so if he or she is of the view that the examination is necessary in order to properly evaluate the witness\u2019 evidence. In his questions, the trier of facts is not limited to queries designed to clear up doubtful points, but can extend the questions to matters not dealt with in Counsel\u2019s examination of the witness. (See Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd edition, at section 16.9.) These were the reasons for the questions I put to the witness. I felt that the examination-in-chief was incomplete and a lot of points which should have been dealt with were still unanswered.\n[54] When first asked where he was parked the witness said that he could not accurately indicate the precise location. In order to assist him, I asked him to look at a drawing of the Central Station Complex which had been introduced in evidence. I then asked him again if he could show me where he was parked and he answered: In this vicinity. I can\u2019t say accurately\u2026 For my benefit, when I would be reviewing the evidence, I asked him to put his initial next to the area he had pointed to and that is when things got out of hand. He said that he\u2019d rather not do as he was asked because he did not want to be held to it. He further added that If I go down there and measure it, then I\u2019ll be happy to do it. The following exchange then followed:\nThe Chairperson : Could you just initial right there, your initials--Marshall Schecter--just to indicate at about where you were\u2026\nMr. M. Schecter : I\u2019d rather not.\nThe Chairperson : Well, I would ask you to do it to indicate\u2026\nMr. M. Schecter : I don\u2019t want to be held to it. I don\u2019t want to be held to it, because I know I was around here...\n[55] The witness was forgetting that he was under oath and that he would be held to the evidence he was giving and if this evidence was not clear then it would be difficult for me to make a ruling in the Complainant\u2019s favour on this issue.\n[56] The witness then started to be argumentative, raised his voice and again challenged my authority. The exchange continued:\nThe Chairperson : So, you can\u2019t indicate precisely where you were?\nMr. M. Schecter : If I go down there and measure it, then I\u2019ll be happy to do it.\nThe Chairperson : Okay, I\u2019ve got no evidence of exactly where you were parked at that point. Okay.\nMr. M. Schecter : I would like to say that I want to have that measured, and then I\u2019ll come back and I will tell you, is that all right? [\u2026] Well--well, listen, you\u2019re asking me to put my \u2013 I don\u2019t know the scale of the plan\u2026[...] and if we\u2019re going to get into technicalities, I have the right and I want it on record that I want to know what the scale is and I\u2019ll measure it off, and then I\u2019ll sign it. But\u2026\nThe Chairperson : The scales are not important. The only thing\u2026\nMr. M. Schecter : To me, yes, they are, sir. If we\u2019re talking technicalities, they are.\nThe Chairperson : Okay, sir, if you -- the evidence I\u2019ve got is put in today, this is what I\u2019m getting, and I\u2019m not getting\u2026 [Interrupting me in mid-sentence.]\nMr. M. Schecter : [In a strong voice, almost yelling] Well, no, then, I\u2019m sorry, we -- I\u2019 don\u2019t want to proceed without having the opportunity to take\u2026\nThe Chairperson : Sir, I decide if we\u2019re going to proceed or not.\nMr. M. Schecter : [Shouting] No, I decide.\nThe Chairperson : No, you\u2019re the witness!\n[57] I then tried to bring back order, but to no avail. To avoid a shouting match with the witness, I decided to adjourn the hearing for five minutes, hoping that this would cool him down.\n[58] When the hearing resumed, the Complainant offered his apologies for what had just happened but his wife interjected and said that there\u2019s no apology necessary. The Complainant tried to explain his son\u2019s behaviour but the witness did not let him finish and continued in the same way he had before the break. At one point the Complainant again intervened telling his son in a stern voice: That\u2019s enough now\u2026, but with no success. The witness then proceeded to threaten me by saying that he would make a full report of the events to the Tribunal, the Bar Association, and everything else because that\u2019s unethical and immoral. And that\u2019s it, no more discussion. Again his father intervened telling him Just a moment, there\u2019s going to be cross-examination, just listen to Mr. McMurray, now.\n[59] At that point, Mr. McMurray asked for a break to prepare his cross-examination. Since it was 11:28 a.m., I decided to break for lunch. I was hoping that this would provide the witness time to cool down and to reflect, with the guidance of his father, on his demeanour during the hearing. Again the witness challenged this decision saying in a loud tone Excuse me, I have a meeting at three o\u2019clock (3:00) and we have\u2026 I called the hearing to order but again the witness interjected aggressively: Let\u2019s go, finished! I won\u2019t be back, don\u2019t waste your time! [The exclamation marks are those of the Court Reporter.]\n[60] Unfortunately, in the afternoon the Complainant and his witness did not return to the hearing and the Respondent was deprived of his right to cross-examine the witness. I then proceeded to adjourn the hearing until the next morning.\n[61] That same afternoon of May 9, 2005, under my instructions, a letter signed by GregoryM.Smith, the Registrar of the Tribunal, was personally served on the Complainant. An Affidavit of Service sworn to by Michel Fiset, a sworn Bailiff of Justice of the Province of Quebec was filed before the Tribunal. In this affidavit, Mr. Fiset stated that he had personally served the Complainant with a copy of the letter on May 9, 2005 at 7:26 p.m. at his domicile. The letter in question informed the Complainant that the Tribunal had adjourned the hearing until 9:30a.m. on Tuesday, May 10, 2005 and that, should the Complainant not be present at that time, the Tribunal would proceed with the hearing of the complaint in his absence. The letter also informed the Complainant that the Tribunal would not tolerate any further outbursts from the Complainant\u2019s witness, Mr. Marshall Schecter. I am satisfied on the basis of this evidence that the Complainant did receive adequate notice that the proceedings would resume on May 10, 2005 and that he chose not to attend.\n[62] On May 10, 2005 and for the following days of the hearing, the Registry Officer started the hearing by asking if Benjamin Schecter, the Complainant, or anybody representing him, was present in the hearing room. The record of the hearing reflects that no response was received to these enquiries.\n[63] The Complainant was given a full and ample opportunity to appear at the hearing, present evidence and make representations. Without giving any reasons for his decision or filing a motion before the Tribunal to withdraw his complaint, he decided to ignore the instructions given in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of May 9, 2005 and chose to withdraw from any further participation in the hearing. By doing so the Complainant relinquished his rights therein to appear, present evidence, cross-examine the Respondent\u2019s witnesses and make final arguments.\n[64] For its part, the Respondent chose to participate fully in these proceedings and it should not be prejudiced by the Complainant\u2019s decision not to do so.\n[65] In accordance with the power vested in me by the Act to decide any procedural or legal questions arising during the hearing, I decided to proceed in the absence of the Complainant. I felt that it was important, for all parties involved, that the issue come to a final conclusion. A lot of time, preparation and financial resources have been devoted for the preparation of the hearing and for the hearing itself and it was my opinion that these could not be wasted because one witness decided that he was not going to participate anymore. (For decisions of the Tribunal where hearings proceeded in the absence of one of the parties see : Fox v. Musqueam Indian Band & Hargitt, 2004 CHRT17 (CanLII); Sanusi v. Brown, 2004 CHRT 33 (CanLII); Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. and DesRosiers v. Barbe, 2003 CHRT24 (CanLII); Woiden, Flak, Yeary and Curle v. Lynn, 2002 IIJCan 8171 (CHRT); Warman v. Kybur, 2003 CHRT 18 (IIJCan); Chiliwack Anti-Racism Project Society v. Scott and Churst of Christ in Isreal, 1996 IICan 1793 (CHRT); Khaki and Elterman v. Canadian Liberty Net, 1993 IIJCan2806 (CHRT)).\n[66] It is unfortunate that the Complainant, a former judge and a former Member of the Tribunal, made the decision to withdraw from the hearing. But in fairness to him, having seen and heard what occurred on that day and on the previous days, I am still not convinced that he made that decision of his own free will. Be that as it may, the Complainant fully understands, I am sure, the consequences of this decision.\n[67] Regarding the evidence given by Marshall Schecter, since the Respondent never had the opportunity to cross-examine him, the relevance and weight of this evidence will be very limited.\nIV. The Facts [68] The Complainant suffers from a chronic degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Although, no medical evidence was submitted, the medical condition of the Complainant was not challenged by the Respondent and the Tribunal concludes that he does suffer from a deficiency.\n[69] In 1999, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec sent him a Certificat d\u2019attestation and a parking tag for disabled persons to hang from the rear view mirror of his car.\n[70] The Complainant conceded that his knowledge of the events which forms the basis of his claim is limited, as he was not present during most of these and that a good deal of the information he has regarding these events came from his son. On many occasions, the Complainant put emphasis on the fact that most of the correspondence, calls and communications concerning this matter were done by his son.\n[71] The Complainant\u2019s wife was not very helpful as a witness. She admitted that she also had a limited knowledge of the events and that she relied on the information given to her by her son. Also, her conduct as a witness did not help the Tribunal\u2019s task in finding out the facts. She was very argumentative and at some point showed impatience with Counsel and with the Tribunal.\n[72] During his tenure as a Member of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, the Complainant was required to travel to Ottawa to hear cases. On these occasions he and his wife would travel by train leaving from CN Central Station in Montreal (Central Station). The Complainant and his wife testified that they had made the trip between Montreal and Ottawa by train at least a hundred times. Apart from June 7, 2001, the Complainant admitted that they had always been satisfied with the services provided at Central Station.\n[73] On their return to Montreal, their son, Marshall Schecter, would come and pick them up at Central Station. According to Mr. Marshall Schecter he had been at Central Station for the last ten (10) years \u2013 approximately twenty five to thirty (25-30) times a year, coming and going, so it would make it fifty to sixty (50-60) times a year. Dropping-off his parents at the Central Station could take between five (5) to ten (10) minutes and picking them up between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) minutes. He also admitted that before June 7, 2001, he never had an incident at the Central Station.\n[74] Mr. Michel Legault, who during the period relevant to this hearing was the Director, Special Projects, Canada and U.S, for the Respondent, testified as to the physical layout of Central Station. Central Station is owned by the Respondent. Its purpose is mainly to provide access to the trains for the passengers of VIA Rail, Amtrak and AMT.\n[75] Geographically, the Central Station Complex is situated in a square bordered to the north by Boulevard Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque, to the west by Mansfield Street, to the east by Universit\u00e9 Street and to the south by la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street. To the south of complex the Complex there is an entrance in the shape of a horseshoe which allows egress and ingress to Central Station from de la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street. The horseshoe also serves as an access route for emergency vehicles. There is no public parking in the horseshoe, although taxis that provide services to the passengers coming to Central Station are allowed to park there, as well as vehicles belonging to Budget Rent-A-Car. Some parking spaces are also reserved for the executives of the Respondent and of VIA Rail.\n[76] The horseshoe area is supervised by security guards who, although they are employees of a third party, are under the control of the Respondent. One of the purposes for the presence of these security guards is to make sure that there is a continuous flow of traffic through the horseshoe area. According to Mr. Legault, there is a policy of tolerance in the case where someone is helping somebody with restricted mobility or if they have a lot of luggage. In those circumstances, the security guards will allow the car to be left unattended for a few minutes so as to let the driver help the passenger get into Central Station or remove some luggage from the car.\n[77] In the middle of the horseshoe there is a privately operated public parking lot accessible through la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street. It is also referred too as the South Plaza parking. There is another parking garage, the Belmont Garage which is accessible by Mansfield Street and University Street.\n[78] The Belmont Garage is situated directly above the South Plaza parking. It has four (4) levels and a roof parking. Central Station is accessed from this garage by elevators and a stairway. The elevators give access to the eastern portion of the horseshoe next to the main entrance of Central Station.\n[79] There are no public parking spots designated as handicapped in the South Plaza parking, but in the Belmont Garage two parking spots per floor, except for the roof, are designated as such. These parking spots are situated near the elevators, so that when disembarking, the elevator will be readily available for the driver and passengers of the vehicle. Once in the elevator they will be directed to the ground floor of the Belmont Garage where they will have to switch elevators to move to a second one which will bring them to the Central Station level.\n[80] To facilitate mobility in and out of Central Station there are no curbs at the main entrance. The entrance is also equipped with automatic doors. Benches are available for people to sit on while they wait. VIA\u2019s personnel, called Red Caps, are available to help passengers with their luggage.\n[81] Regarding the physical features of Central Station, the Complainant testified that there was no difference on June 7, 2001 than what he had noticed on his previous visits.\n[82] On June 7, 2001, the Complainant and his wife were returning by train to Montreal from Ottawa. The train was due to arrive at Central Station at 5:08 p.m. According to the evidence, VIA Train number 34, coming from Ottawa, arrived on that day, at 5:15 p.m., a seven (7) minutes delay. There were 93 passengers on board the train. At approximately the same time (5:06 p.m.), Train 60 from Toronto pulled into Central Station with 284 passengers on board.\n[83] Marshall Schecter\u2019s recollection of the events that followed his arrival in the horseshoe on June 7, 2001 is different from that of the security guard, \u00c9ric Geoffroy, who was on duty in the South Plaza on that day. In view of the fact that the Respondent never had a chance to cross-examine Marshall Schecter and because of the conduct and behaviour of this witness which rendered his testimony unreliable, in case of conflict, the evidence of Mr. Geoffroy will be preferred.\n[84] Marshall Schecter testified that he arrived at Central Station on June 7, 2001 at 4:57 p.m. Neither the Complainant, nor his wife could confirm this. In cross-examination the Complainant explained that he doesn\u2019t know from personal knowledge if the car was parked for more than 15minutes or not. He added I only know from my son that he was there at 4:57 and that he would be in a better position to answer this question. Unfortunately, because of his decision to leave the hearing, this never happened.\n[85] In the Incident Report he prepared on June 7, 2001, Mr. Geoffroy specified that Mr.Schecter arrived at Central Station at 4:40 p.m. I see no reason to doubt the evidence given by Mr. Geoffroy on this point. He presented himself as a calm and disinterested witness and referred to his notes which were contemporaneous to the events referred to in the complaint. The Complainant had the chance to cross-examine Mr. Geoffroy but in deciding to withdraw from the proceedings, he relinquished this right and the evidence of Mr. Geoffroy remained unchallenged. I will accept Mr. Geoffroy\u2019s evidence that Marshall Schecter arrived at the station around 4:40 p.m. and not at 4:57 p.m.\n[86] Marshall Schecter testified that a security guard of the Respondent approached him within sixty seconds of his arrival at Central Station and asked him could you move your car please? His answer was No, I won\u2019t. He said that he then asked the security guard why he should move his car and the answer was Because you\u2019re blocking. He replied that he would move the car about one or two car lengths but according to him this did not satisfy the security guard. At that point, he said that he hung the handicap vignette on the rear view mirror and stated I\u2019m not moving at all. He added that the security guard then started to harass him and went into a rage.\n[87] When asked where he was parked on that particular day, Marshall Schecter never gave a precise answer. When he was requested to indicate on a drawing of the Central Station Complex where he was parked and to put his initial next to the area indicated, he answered I\u2019d rather not. The events that followed have been touched on in another part of this decision and there is no need to go over them again, except to add that the Tribunal was never given any evidence by the Complainant\u2019s witnesses as to where the car was parked on that day and can only draw a negative conclusion from this absence of evidence.\n[88] Mr. Geoffroy did not deny that he approached Mr. Schecter\u2019s car upon its arrival. He added that the car was parked on the north side of the horseshoe, very close to the main entrance to Central Station.\n[89] He said that he approached the vehicle and asked the driver what he was waiting for since there was no train arrival expected at that time. He added that Marshall Schecter answered that he was there to pick up his father who was arriving on the Ottawa train and who had difficulty walking. Mr. Geoffroy then asked him to come back at 5:00 p.m. since the waiting time is not more than five (5) minutes in the horseshoe. Marshall Schecter answered that he was not going to move and then took the vignette for handicap parking out of the glove compartment and hung it on the rear-view mirror.\n[90] Mr. Geoffroy testified that in order to appease the situation, he suggested that Mr. Schecter move his vehicle up thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet so that it would not block the traffic. Mr.Schecter again refused.\n[91] Mr. Geoffroy added that Mr. Marshall Schecter and his son then became verbally aggressive and he decided to call a colleague as back up. By this time it was around 5:00 p.m. His colleague tried to communicate with Mr. Schecter but to no avail. The decision was then made to call the Montreal Urban Police. The first police car arrived on the scene at 5:10 p.m. Mr. Geoffroy proceeded to explain what had just happened and then the police officers took control of the situation. He added that his colleagues and him remained as interested observers but did not intervene in the events that followed.\n[92] The situation having escalated, the police officers called in reinforcement and, soon after, two more police vehicles arrived at the scene. The Complainant and his wife were not present in the horseshoe area during these events.\n[93] Upon arriving at Central Station from Ottawa, the Complainant and his wife testified that it was their routine to wait after the other passengers had gotten off the train before detraining. The Complainant admitted that he cannot walk very fast because of his deficiency. From the train platform to the main concourse of the station, he would take the escalator since he always avoid[ed] stairs whenever possible. He also added that before leaving Central Station, he would go to the men\u2019s washroom and when he came out his grandson would escort him to his car.\n[94] Mrs. Schecter testified that the detraining on June 7, 2001 took between seven to ten minutes. So when they got off the train, which arrived at 5:15 p.m., and up the escalator, it would have been close to 5:25 p.m. The Complainant then had to walk to the washroom and after proceed to the horseshoe area.\n[95] According to the evidence of the Complainant and that of his wife, on June 7, 2001, they met their grandson at the top of the escalator. The Complainant\u2019s wife said that she could see that he was nervous, although she did not say if she questioned him at that time about the reasons for this nervousness. The Complainant said that he then proceeded to the washroom accompanied by his grandson.\n[96] The evidence of the Complainant\u2019s wife on what took place thereafter is interesting. She testified: he [the grandson] walked my husband to the men\u2019s room where we left my husband and [my] grandson proceeded to escort me to our car where my son was waiting for us. (The emphasis is mine.) Why did she not wait for her husband or ask her grandson to do so in view of her husband\u2019s condition and the fact that on many occasions during her evidence she stated that her husband depended on her to move around? She certainly did not need to be escorted back to the car as there is no evidence that she cannot walk by herself. She later added that they had completely forgot[ten] about the fact [that they had] left my husband in the men\u2019s room. This behaviour is certainly perplexing in view of the evidence given at the hearing pertaining to the difficulty that the Complainant has to walk unassisted. One would have expected that either Mrs.Schecter or the grandson would have waited for the Complainant to come out of the washroom.\n[97] The Complainant testified that when he came out of the washroom, there was nobody there to help him. He added that a young stranger helped him walk back to the parking area, where he noticed that his grandson was being detained in a police van. He stated that he appealed to the policemen who, upon his request, released his grandson.\n[98] The evidence of the Complainant and that of his wife does not coincide with the evidence of Mr. Geoffroy. According to his report, neither Marshall Schecter, nor his son, were allowed to enter Central Station on June 7, 2001. He testified that the younger Schecter had, before the police arrived, attempted to enter Central Station but was prevented from doing so. He further indicated in his report that the Complainant and his wife arrived at the main entrance of the South Plaza together just when the two other police vehicles were arriving at the scene.\n[99] He added that there was a lot of yelling and that his colleague and he stayed out of the way and let the police officers deal with the situation. At one point, he noticed that the Complainant was talking with one of the police officers about the situation pertaining to his grandson. The officers released the grandson in his grandfather\u2019s care at about 5:30 p.m. Mr. Geoffroy added that Marshall Schecter then turned towards him and told him You\u2019ll pay for this.\n[100] The Complainant also testified that at some point he was put into a City of Montreal police car or van. He also testified that his wife drove away in their car and that he stayed behind with his son and grandson.\n[101] The Complainant\u2019s wife added that her husband was discarded like a piece of worthless meat by the Respondent\u2019s security guard. She added that she was ordered by a CN security guard to remove the car and to park outside the horseshoe area. Again this is an interesting comment considering the fact that during cross-examination, when asked if she recalled where the car was parked on June 7, 2001, she answered: How can I remember? When I got there I never saw a car. All I saw were policemen fighting and pushing. Later she added: I know it was passed\u2014I did not see it near the horseshoe. It was parked much further because the altercation happened close to the entrance. [\u2026] I didn\u2019t see the car there, so it must have been further away. (The emphasis is mine). If she had to move the car as she testified, she had to know where it was parked.\n[102] The Complainant\u2019s recollection of the events that followed was that he was later delivered by a police vehicle to where his wife had gone to park the car. He could not remember where the car had been parked by his wife or how the police officers knew where she had parked the car. The Complainant\u2019s wife added that her husband was brought to her about half an hour later in a police car but she did not indicate where she was parked or how the police knew where to find her. She then said that they proceeded back to the Central Station to pick up her son and grandson.\n[103] This evidence does not correspond with the recollection that Mr. Geoffroy has of the incident. According to his report, the Schecter\u2019s vehicle remained parked at exactly the same spot throughout this entire confrontation and it was never moved by anybody. He further added that the whole family left together in the car at 5:35 p.m.\n[104] On June 12, 2001, the Complainant\u2019s wife prepared a handwritten statement of what happened on June 7, 2001. In this statement, she makes no reference to the Respondent or any of its employees or to the fact that the Complainant was put into a police vehicle. This is most surprising bearing in mind her evidence at the hearing that they were grabbed by security guards and not policemen, that they pushed my husband [\u2026] into a paddy wagon and that the security guards discarded [him] like a piece of worthless meat. One would have expected, considering the seriousness of these accusations, that she would have mentioned these in her handwritten notes. But nowhere in these notes are there any references to these events regarding her husband and the Respondent\u2019s security guards.\n[105] It is also important to note that nowhere in the Complaint Form are there any references to these incidences pertaining to the Complainant. On the contrary, on reading the complaint one has the impression that the arrival of the Complainant at the horseshoe area had some appeasing effect. The Complainant states in his complaint: In the meantime, when I came out of the washroom, there was nobody there to help me. A young stranger helped me walk to the parking area where I saw my grandson detained in a police van. I then appealed to a MUC policeman and, upon my request, my grandson was released. The complaint continues I consider that the Canadian National Railway Company discriminated against me by not providing parking spaces designated specifically for vehicles with a parking tag for disabled persons. As a consequence of the lack of accommodation, my wife, Irma Schecter and my son, Marshall Schecter were assaulted and my grandson, Myles Schecter was assaulted [\u2026]. Again there is no reference to an assault on the Complainant by employees of the Respondent.\n[106] Consequently, I find that Mrs. Irma Schecter\u2019s testimony regarding her husband being pushed and discarded by the Respondent\u2019s security guards is totally unfounded and unsupported by the evidence.\nV. The Decision [107] In his complaint the Complainant alleges that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of a disability by failing to accommodate his relatives and himself in the provision of facilities contrary to section 5 of the Act.\n[108] Section 5 provides:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities oraccommodation customarily available to the general public\nto deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[109] Numerous decisions have indicated that the Act should be given a large and a liberal interpretation consistent with its quasi-constitutional status and in a manner that ensures the attainment of its objectives. The purpose of the Act is set out in section 2:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with otherindividuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties andobligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[110] In Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at page 547, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of the purpose of a human rights act in this manner:\nThe accepted rules of construction are flexible enough to enable the Court torecognize in the construction of a human rights code the special nature andpurpose of the enactment [\u2026] and give to it an interpretation which willadvance its broad purposes. Legislation of this type is of a special nature, not quite constitutional but certainly more than the ordinary\u2014and it is for the courts to seek out its purpose and give it effect. The Code aims at the removal ofdiscrimination. This is to state the obvious. Its main approach, however, is not to punish the discriminator, but rather to provide relief for the victims ofdiscrimination. [The emphasis is mine.]\n[111] In Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, the Supreme Court added, at paragraph 8:\nThe purpose of the Act is set forth in s. 2 as being to extend the laws of Canada to give effect to the principle that every individual should have an equal opportunity with other individuals to live his or her own life without being hindered bydiscriminatory practices based on certain prohibited grounds of discrimination [\u2026] the Act must be so interpreted as to advance the broad policy considerations underlying it.\n[112] Accordingly, the Act should be used to further its purpose; it should not be used as a tool to pursue vengeance for events not related to a discriminatory practice.\n[113] In this case, the only issue I have to decide is whether the Respondent\u2019s conduct is such that a discriminatory practice on the basis of disability occurred. There are very few cases which assist in determining the answer to this question because the large majority of human rights cases arise from employment situations and very few cases have been decided on an allegation of discrimination in the provision of services, facilities or accommodation, such as is the case here.\n[114] In the case of Re Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission et al and Canadian Odeon Theatres Limited (1985) 18 D.L.R. 4th 93, the Complainant bought a ticket to see a movie and entered the theatre, but was required to sit in his wheelchair at the front of the theatre. He filed a complaint under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, alleging discrimination with respect to services or facilities offered to the public on the basis of physical handicap. An adjudicator found in his favour. The decision was set aside on appeal but was restored on further appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The majority judgment was delivered by Vancise, J.A. At page 113, he stated:\nThe question to be determined in this case is whether the physical arrangements for the viewing of a movie which are available to all members of the public but which have the practical effect or consequence of discriminating against one or more members of the public because of a prohibited ground, i.e., physical disability, is discrimination.\n[115] At page 115, he further stated:\nThe treatment of a person differently from others may or may not amount todiscrimination just as treating people equally is not determinative of the issue. If the effect of the treatment has adverse consequences which are incompatible with the objects of the legislation by restricting or excluding a right of full and equalrecognition and exercise of those rights it will be discriminatory: see also Re Rocca Group Ltd. and Muise (1979), 102 D.L.R. (3D) 529, 22 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 1; Post Office v Union of Post Office Workers, [1974] 1 W.L.R. 89.\n[116] Discrimination in a human rights context is exclusion, restriction or preference of treatment based on one of a number of protected characteristics, the result of which is the prevention or impairment of the exercise of human rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Code. In order to determine whether the Complainant was discriminated against in this case, I must of necessity identify the specific act or acts of which he complains as being discriminatory or which resulted in discrimination. It is apparent from an examination of the complaint filed, and the evidence, that the specific act complained of as constituting discrimination is the fact that the Complainant\u2019s son was not able to park in the horseshoe area of Central Station in order to wait for his father who was due to arrive on the Ottawa train. The issue in this case is whether the conduct of the Respondent towards the Complainant, a physically reliant person, results in treatment which is restrictive, detrimental or prejudicial to him. If it does, it is discriminatory and contrary to the provision of section 5 of the Act.\n[117] The Act must be given a liberal interpretation to ensure that its purpose as set out in section 2 is achieved. Accordingly, in order to find whether the Complainant was discriminated against, it is necessary to determine if the service or facility offered to him varied in any significant manner from the service or facility offered by the Respondent to the general public. The answer to this inquiry is no. The service offered to the Complainant did not vary significantly from the service offered to the general public. The evidence shows that the Complainant was allowed to proceed to the horseshoe area, to park there for a certain time in order to disembark or embark into his vehicle. The evidence shows that he had done this on numerous previous occasions and, according to the Complainant\u2019s own evidence, he had never encountered any bad experiences at the Central Station on these occasions. What had changed on June 7, 2001 was the presence of police officers. The question is then: Why were these police officers present at the horseshoe on that evening?\n[118] The only answer to this question is the stubbornness of the Complainant\u2019s son. When he was first approached by the security guard, there was no reason for the Complainant son\u2019s refusal to move his car. His father was not in the car, nor was he waiting to board the car. The Complainant\u2019s son could at that time have moved the car and sent his son in Central Station to meet his parents. He could have returned later to Central Station to pick up his parents. The only reason why he refused to do so is that he found this to be an inconvenience to himself; it had nothing to do with his father\u2019s deficiency. If he did reasonably believe that the security guards were acting in a discriminatory manner, he should have realised that confrontation was not the answer. He should have moved his car and later filed a grievance or a complaint in his father\u2019s name with the appropriate authorities.\n[119] The decision he made to stay there and confront the security guards was most unwise. It also demonstrates a trait of his character which was revealed at the hearing and corroborated by other evidence: he has a very short temper. Mr. Jacques Perron, Legal Counsel for the Respondent, who testified at the hearing, as well as a Memorandum to File written by Mr.Charles Unterburg of the Commission, both made references to this characteristic of the witness\u2019 behaviour.\n[120] Unfortunately, the Complainant was confronted with these events but in no way can he inflict the consequences of these on the Respondent or his employees. No evidence was presented at the hearing by the Complainant to support such a conclusion. Had the Complainant presented his case fully and had he proceeded to cross-examine the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, my conclusion might have been different. Sadly for him, the evidence before me does not support his claim.\n[121] In view of these circumstances, I cannot find, as this Tribunal did in Canadian Paraplegic Assn. v. Canada (Elections Canada), 1992 CanLII 284 (C.H.R.T.), that the Respondent's action is discriminatory. I cannot find that there was here a difference in treatment within the meaning of section 5 of the Act. I cannot find that the Respondent was responsible for any embarrassment, risk of injury or inconvenience to the Complainant. The Complainant was the victim of a set of circumstances which had nothing to do with discrimination, at least based on the evidence before me.\nVI.

INTRODUCTION [1] The present complaint alleges that Eldon Warman contravened section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by posting anti-semitic messages on the internet. On April 27, 2005, in the course of the hearing, I made the following ruling on liability.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON:\n...I have reviewed the evidence and the jurisprudence provided by the Commission. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the postings that were entered into evidence are communications from Eldon Warman, within the meaning of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nI am not here to regulate the free exchange of ideas. There may be an element of legitimate political debate in the material entered into evidence and the Respondent has a right to his views. Some of the postings go beyond the legal parameters of public debate, however, and contravene the provisions of the Act.\nMy concern is with the sentiments expressed in this material. The postings from the Respondent express an open hatred of Jews. They demean and vilify Jewish people. They promote hatred and contempt. This strikes at the dignity of all persons and harms the public good.\nI am satisfied that the complaint has been substantiated, and I will provide the parties with written reasons at a later date.\nSo you have a finding of liability. I think, in terms of the order, that I will move to the order and then I will hear from the Commission.\nORDER BY THE TRIBUNAL\nI have already heard from the parties on remedy and there is no need for further submissions on the request for an order under section 54(1)(a) and section 53(2)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. I am prepared to grant an order, in the general terms set out in the decision of this Tribunal in Warman v. Kyburz, the citation being 2003 CHRT 18, at paragraph 83.\nI hereby order the Respondent, Eldon Warman, who has identified himself as Eldon-Gerald of the Warman family, to cease the discriminatory practice of posting messages or other material on the internet that is likely to expose Jews or any other member of an identifiable racial, religious or ethnic group to hatred or contempt.\nI would ask the Commission to provide me with a formal order. (T. 344)\nI reserved my decision on the question of penalty and advised the parties that I would issue written reasons at a later date.\nA. Service [2] The Commission and the Tribunal have served Eldon Warman with documents relating to the hearing on many occasions. He has persistently avoided service. A Table setting out the details of the many attempts to serve him was entered as exhibit T-5 during the course of the hearing.Exibit T-5 is attached as an appendix to this decision.\n[3] One package of documents was returned to the Tribunal on April 20, 2005. It contained a NOTICE stating, inter alia:\nThis would appear to be important documents to you, so I am returning them intact and unopened. If you intended them for me, I hereby refuse your offer of contract, or any assumed contract, regarding your claimed right to jurisdiction over me.\nIn the same Notice, Eldon Warman takes issue with the use of his name and states that the person referred to in his birth certificate is a legal fiction, the property of the Crown in right of the Province of New Brunswick.\n[4] On March 31, 2005, Eldon Warman was personally served with documents from the Commission. There was something of an altercation. The affidavit from the process server states that he served Eldon Warman with documents and began to walk away.\nThe said Respondent then picked up a rock about the size of his hand. I turned and advised him that if he touched me that I would charge him with assault. He then stated you couldn't charge me with assault because I'm going to fucking kill you. I then ran to my car and left the area.\nThis seems to reflect Mr. Warman's attitude towards the present proceedings.\n[5] There is another affidavit stating that there were eight attempts to personally serve Eldon Warman with documents from the Tribunal. I subsequently issued an order for substitutional service. On a number of occasions, documents have been left affixed to the main door of his residence. I am satisfied that Eldon Warman is aware of the present proceedings and has chosen not to participate in them.\n[6] The attempts to serve Eldon Warman continued, after the question of liability was decided. I insisted that the Commission serve a notice on Eldon Warman that it was seeking a penalty of 10,000 dollars under section 54(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Although the Commission was unable to complete personal service, this notice was left taped to his door, along with my order to cease and desist.\n[7] I think the situation before me is more than a simple attempt to evade service. It is really a question of attornment. The evidence in the case indicates that Eldon Warman refuses to accept the authority of the courts and the other legal institutions in this country. I think it is clear that he does not accept the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the matter.\nII. FACTS A. Background [8] The Complainant, Richard Warman, is not related to the Respondent. He advised the Tribunal that he has spent 15 years campaigning against hate messages. About five years ago, he focused on the internet. Although he was not qualified as an expert, I allowed him to provide some background on the material that was entered into evidence.\n[9] Richard Warman informed the Tribunal that there is a freeman or sovereign citizens movement. There are elements of the Posse Commitatus in the thinking of the movement. Its proponents believe that the only legitimate source of political power is local. This has given rise to a de-tax movement, which believes that the taxes imposed by government are unlawful. There is an idea that taxation is contrary to the Magna Carta.\n[10] Eldon Warman is a leading person in the de-tax movement. He has received some attention from the media and has given seminars that explain why individuals have no obligation to pay taxes. The evidence established that he operates a website called \u00a9Detax Canada\u00ae which advises people how to Permanently-Effectively-Lawfully stop paying tax. This website can be found at: www.detaxcanada.org.\n[11] The website espouses a radical libertarianism, which places individual rights above the moral reach of government. The website contains a mix of morality, law, and politics, with exhortations not to pay tax, recover Canada as a free country, and restore the God Given INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS of Canadians. Some of the material is rather banal, such as the reference to the CCRA, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency as Cursed Cannibals and Rabid Animals.\n[12] The website attacks the legitimacy of the legal order. One of the introductory boxes states::\nYOU ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO HIGH TREASON Judges are primary factor in this TREASON against the Canadian people\nCanadian judges are using an American produced Anti-Government Movement Guidebook to deprive sovereign Canadians of their God Given Rights within the de facto corporate commercial Canadian court system - controlled by the Inner Temple of the `City of London, a hostile foreign entity.\nThe threat is palpable. A box states: you have a right to use deadly force to stop these unlawful acts against you. There are dark suggestions that the sovereignty of the people should be restored.\n[13] There is a section on the web-site devoted to the establishment of a Canadian Magna Carta that lists the grievances of the Canadian people. There is a suggestion that the federal and provincial governments are unlawful. The Constitution Act of 1982 is an absolute HOAX and FRAUD. The Canadian people have been unlawfully converted into chattel corporate slaves by the massive debt of these governments, which is based upon counterfeit money borrowed from foreign bankers.\n[14] This seems to be the place where anti-semitism enters into the discourse. The same document argues that the Banksters of the City of London have usurped the authority of the British Crown and are using the taxation system to produce income for themselves. It is apparent from other material that the word bankster is a reference to Jewish interests. The website alleges that our government has been corrupted by an illicit conspiracy between Jews and free masons.\n[15] I want to be fair. There are some attempts to separate this kind of conspiracy theory from any racial, ethnic or religious views. One entry on the site states: I have no `axe to grind' with any ethnic, racial or religious grouping of people in Canada, or elsewhere.\nB. The Postings [16] The substantive evidence against Eldon Warman consisted primarily of copies of e-mail postings on public sites. These messages were collected by the Complainant through the use of internet search engines. Some of the messages appeared on bulletin boards and in newsgroups, arranged by topic. Some of the messages were taken from one posting and pasted to another.\n[17] Eldon Warman's name appears on the postings. The author of the postings can also be deduced from the return addresses and the contents of the messages. The earlier messages use two addresses: egwarman@hotmail.com and warmael@hotmail.com. Eldon Warman used the latter address when he registered the www.detaxcanada.org website on the whois registry of domains. There is a third address on the later postings, from 2002 on: egwarman@outgun.com. This address appears on the detax website.\n[18] The messages speak in one voice. The author uses the same language and returns repeatedly to the same themes. I think that I can draw the natural inference from the multitude of sources in front of me, in the absence of any other evidence, and conclude that Eldon Warman was the author of these messages. It would be speculative to find otherwise.\n[19] The messages that were entered into evidence portray the Jewish people as enemies. Eldon Warman traces a number of ills to the Jewish people. This ranges from abortion clinics to the Rwandan genocide. There are abusive references to the Jewish tradition. The Talmud is referred to as hate literature and the evil trash of the Rabbim of the Synagogue of Satan.\n[20] Most of the messages are from email conversations that took place on the internet. Eldon Warman replies to someone, perhaps a civil servant, in the following terms.\nSo you stinking Fu*kin TRAITOR Zionist Jew BASTARD - hows that for anti-Edomite, er...anti-semitic if you prefer...If you represent that which is called a semite, then you'd better believe that I am an anti-semite....I am very intolerant of NAZI-ZIONIST MURDERING JEW slime like you Freddie. A jerk who is employed to attempt to keep Canadians in slavery and to destroy Canadian People and their families.\nThere are many abusive comments.\n[21] Eldon Warman debases the Jewish people. Elsewhere, he responds to a correspondent in the following terms:\nCriswell, go back to screwing little goy boys, like the good Zionist Jew you obviously are.\nAnother correspondent suggests that Eldon Warman is mentally ill. He replies:\nIt seems I have the Jew boys really slinging their PIG SHIT, instead of doing what they do best, declare it kosher and dine on it....And, may their babies be butchered in their Jew owned abortion clinics.\nThe tone of the messages is dehumanizing.\n[22] The most disturbing message is at p. 131 of the transcript:\nMS. PHILLIPS: Why don't you read the last paragraph, then, Mr. Warman.\n[RICHARD] WARMAN: The last paragraph states:\nJoe the JewBoy, Thanks for bringing back this reminder for the People of Canada and the United States to read and refresh their memory of what your NAZI-ZIONIST JEWS have done to the People of America. It's too bad we don't have a greater need for soap and lampshades, but, I suppose it would be difficult to get the stench of pig shit out of that slimy fat.\nEldon Warman\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Let's be clear about this. What is this reference -- I think I understand. This is someone else posting a message that Eldon Warman had sent in the past? That's what it seems to be.\nMS PHILLIPS: It seems to me that Joe, this person with a very long e-mail, re-posted a previous posting by Mr. Warman within the thread of this bulletin board, and he has brought it back to the attention of the people who are currently discussing on the bulletin board to give them an idea of who Mr. Eldon Warman is, and then at the part that Mr. Richard Warman just read out, Mr. Eldon Warman is thanking him for bringing back the reminder to the people of Canada.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: So there is some kind of debate or discussion taking place, and someone else goes back and posts this previous message from Eldon Warman -- and that is his message -- and then, of course, Mr. Eldon Warman comes back again and responds to that particular posting. I think I understand.\nMR. [RICHARD] WARMAN: Yes.\nThe original posting was in 1999. The message containing it was dated May 8, 2002.\n[23] I allowed Richard Warman to explain that Eldon Warman was referring to the fact that lampshades and soap were made from the bodies of the Jews who died in the concentration camps of the Third Reich. Eldon Warman was clearly exploiting these kinds of associations, to demonstrate the extent of his commitment to his political views. If he needed racial slurs to advance his political agenda, he was prepared to make use of them.\n[24] There are passages in which Eldon Warman denies the suggestion that he is a racist. He often tries to protect himself from accusations of racism by distinguishing between Jews and Zionist Jews. In one message, he says that his life does not revolve around Jew hatred and states:\n... I do fear greatly for my grandchildren, and the world in which they must try to live their lives with value and meaning - and, not as slaves of Zionist Jew banksters.\nSome of the postings contain legitimate political commentary. This is full of invective, however. Eldon Warman refers to George Bush, the Unelected Jewnited States Fuhrer as leader of the `jackbooted' NAZI style goon squad.\n[25] I can see the beginning of a distinction here, but it does not matter. There is a racial agenda in the postings. I think it is impossible to disentangle Eldon Warman's attitude to Zionist Jews from a more general antipathy towards the Jewish people. The material incites hatred.\nIII. LIABILITY A. General Approach [26] Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act reads as follows:\n13. (1) It is a discriminatory practice for a person ... to communicate telephonically ..., repeatedly ..., any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 13(2) extends this provision to communications made on the internet.\n[27] It seems to me that it is a mistake to see section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act as an independent legal restriction. The purpose of the section is to place some necessary and reasonable limits on our freedom of expression. It qualifies our freedom. This is important for the purposes of analysis, since it means that a Tribunal applying the section should start with the premise that individuals are free to express themselves. The task is to determine the limits of that freedom.\n[28] It is plain that that freedom of expression is part of the fundamental law. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (GA Res 217A (III), UN Doc. A\/810 (1948)) states that everyone has the right to receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Article 19(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (19 December 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171) holds:\n19(2) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.\nArticle 19(3) subjects these freedoms to certain restrictions, which are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others.\n[29] The domestic law uses the same paradigm. The concept of free speech has always held an important place in our democratic tradition. This has been enshrined in section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states:\n2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:\nb) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;\n[30] The Supreme Court recognized that section 13 violated this provision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892. It was nevertheless a reasonable limit under section 1 of the Charter, and was demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n[31] My point is simply that a Tribunal applying section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act is engaged in the rather sensitive task of determining the limits of our fundamental freedoms. This calls for a careful weighing of the constitutional values that are threatened by its application. I do not think that I am overstating the matter when I say that a tribunal that fails to appreciate the constitutional factors that come into play in such an exercise has probably misapplied the section.\n(i) The Law against Hate Messages [32] The legal machinery that finds expression in section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act has its origins in the international law. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n7. All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.\nIt is the suggestion that other people do not deserve equal treatment that offends this kind of provision.\n[33] There is a law against statements that disseminate hatred. Article 20(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:\n20(2) Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.\nSection 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act comes within the general auspices of this article.\n[34] Article 4(a) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Foms of Racial Discrimination (21 Dec. 1965, 66 U.N.T.S. 195) is more explicit. It requires that the state parties:\n4(a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . .\nThe Canadian Human Rights Act is designed to uphold the principle of equality. Section 13 and the related provisions achieve this by preventing the promotion of hatred and removing legally offensive material from the internet.\n[35] Section 13 characterizes the communication of hate messages as a form of discrimination. There are reasons for this. The laws that prohibit the dissemination of hatred derive from the right of individual persons to live their lives, free from hatred and inequality. I think Parliament has taken the position that the good relations that provide the foundations of civil society rest on the belief that the people in different groups are equal. This is a fundamental legal and political tenet. Any other view is illegitimate.\n(ii) The Requirements of Section 13 [36] The purpose of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to remove dangerous elements of speech from the public discourse. The removal of these elements of speech from the public discourse promotes equality, tolerance, and the dignity of the person. It also protects the members of minorities from the psychological harm caused by the dissemination of racial views. These views result inevitably in prejudice, discrimination and the potential of physical violence.\n[37] The words expose, hatred and contempt have their ordinary meanings and the only comment I would make is that the concern with hatred in the context of the Canadian Human Rights Act arises out of the fact that hatred for other people imperils their equality. The messages prohibited by the section rob the victims of their dignity as persons and justifies their unequal treatment. This is not permissible.\n[38] The word contempt contains this association of inferiority. It is sufficient if the material is likely to expose a person to hatred or contempt. There is a certain gravity that is nevertheless required, to justify any infringement of freedom of expression. I do not believe that the section catches trivial or inconsequential comments.\n[39] I am satisfied that the requirements of the section have been met in the present case. The frequency of the messages and the nature of their posting on the internet is enough to meet any requirement that they be repeated.\n[40] The Tribunal should also be careful not to enter into the discussion of religious texts. Freedom of religion includes the freedom to dissent. I would nevertheless add that the promulgation of views that promote a contemptuous attitude towards fundamental religious tracts is likely to subject the groups that hold these texts sacred to hatred or contempt.\n[41] I have already issued an order to cease and desist. The Tribunal has been advised by the Commission that the material has been removed from the internet. The fundamental purposes of the Act have accordingly been met.\nIV. PENALTY [42] The Human Rights Commission is also asking for a penalty under section 54(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which states:\n54(1) If a member or panel finds that a complaint related to a discriminatory practice described in section 13 is substantiated, the member or panel may make only one or more of the following orders . . .\n(c) an order to pay a penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars.\nThe Commission is asking for the maximum penalty of 10,000 dollars.\n[43] Section 54(1.1) sets out a number of factors that the Tribunal must consider in assessing a penalty under this provision.\n54(1.1) In deciding whether to order the person to pay the penalty, the member or panel shall take into account the following factors:\nthe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; and the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice, any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in and the person's ability to pay the penalty. The caselaw is too limited to provide much direction outside of these provisions.\nA. Constitutional Issues [44] I originally thought that the constitutional issues that arise in the instance of section 54(1)(c) have been decided. When I reviewed the caselaw, I discovered that this is not the case.\n(i) Taylor [45] The constitutionality of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, where the Supreme Court held that the purpose of section 13 was to prevent the harm caused by hate messages. The penalty in section 54(1)(c) was not added to the legislation until 1998. I cannot see anything in Taylor that speaks to the constitutionality of the penalty provision.\n(ii) Z\u00fcndel [46] The Tribunal has rendered two decisions that address the constitutionality of section 13. The first is Citron v. Z\u00fcndel, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 1. The comments of the panel in Z\u00fcndel are obiter, however, since the complaint arose before the penalty provision came into effect The panel merely held that the provision had no retroactive effect.\n[47] The views of the Z\u00fcndel panel with respect to the Tribunal's mandate under section 13 are nevertheless instructive. At para. 256, the Tribunal found that the majority in Taylor clearly distinguished a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act from an offence under the Criminal Code. It then quoted the following passage in Taylor, at p. 917:\nIt is essential ... to recognize that, as an instrument especially designed to prevent the spread of prejudice and to foster tolerance and equality in the community, the Canadian Human Rights Act is very different from the Criminal Code. The aim of human rights legislation, and of s.13(1) is not to bring the full force of the state's power against a blameworthy individual for the purpose of imposing punishment. Instead, provisions found in human rights statutes generally operate in a less confrontational manner, allowing for a conciliatory settlement if possible and, where discrimination exists, gearing remedial responses more towards compensation of the victim.\nI think the Tribunal was right to focus on this aspect of the Taylor decision.\n(iii) Schnell [48] The Tribunal reconsidered the matter in Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 21, which was decided after the penalty provision came into effect. The argument before Mr. Sinclair was that the introduction of the penalty provision had compromised the constitutional validity of section 13. The Respondent submitted that the section could no longer be justified under s. 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[49] I agree with the Tribunal in Schnell that this argument must be rejected. Mr. Sinclair found that the passage of section 54(1)(c) has pushed section 13 closer to its constitutional limits. He nevertheless felt that the decision of the Supreme Court in Taylor had not been affected by the introduction of the penalty provision. The importance of Schnell is, accordingly, that it reaffirms the constitutionality of section 13.\n[50] I think the significant point in the present context is that the two provisions are severable. The penalty provision may be defective, independently of section 13. I am accordingly of the view that the issues regarding section 54(1)(c) have not been resolved.\n[51] There are other differences. The Commission did not request a penalty in Schnell and the Tribunal declined to exercise its jurisdiction on that basis, so the matter was arguably moot. Mr. Sinclair was also concerned about the lack of information before him, in determining what penalty would be appropriate.\n[52] I think that any decision regarding the validity of section 54(1)(c) must be made in a case where a Tribunal is called upon to award a penalty. There are many reasons for this, not the least of which is that it is impossible for a Member to fully appreciate the weight of such a penalty until he is obliged to impose it. This does not change because the views are repugnant.\n(iv) Kyburz [53] The only case in which the Tribunal has awarded a penalty under section 54(1)(c) is Warman v. Kyburz, [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 18. The constitutionality of the penalty provision was not contested in the case. This was apparently because Mr. Kyburz did not appear.\n[54] The difference between the present case and Kyburz, supra, is that I feel obliged to bring these kinds of issues to the attention of the parties. Some of this may be attributable to the fact that the circumstances of the present case are less compelling than the circumstances in Kyburz. This brings the Charter issues into the foreground.\n[55] I nevertheless agree with the panel in Kyburz, which stated that the imposition of a financial penalty under section 54(1)(c) takes the Tribunal well outside the normal parameters of its jurisdiction. At para. 94, the Tribunal held:\nAwards of special compensation made under section 54(1)(b) in relation to section 13 complaints are intended to compensate individuals specifically named in hate messages. In contrast, penalties levied pursuant to section 54(1)(c) of the Act are intended to reflect society's opprobrium for the respondent's conduct.\nIt is the moral blameworthiness of the Respondent's conduct that attracts the penalty.\n[56] It is significant that the Tribunal in Kyburz found itself unable to apply the penalty provision without using the language of the criminal law. The Tribunal speaks of the penalty as a fine and refers to the Respondent's vilation of the Act as a 'first offence'. It is impossible to escape the correlations between the sentencing process in the criminal courts and the imposition of a penalty under section 54(2).\n(v) Conclusions [57] It will be apparent from my review of the caselaw that the issues regarding the constitutional validity of section 54(1)(c) have not been settled. This is in spite of the fact that the provision obviously restricts the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The factor that distinguishes the present case from other cases is that the obvious issues in the case are constitutional.These issues arise on the surface of the legislation.\n[58] The problem is that Eldon Warman refuses to recognize the authority of the Tribunal and perhaps the legal system as a whole. He has chosen not participate in the inquiry. As a result, the issues that should have been raised on the Respondent's side of the case were never addressed.\n[59] There is very little that I can say about this. The Commission suggested that Eldon Warman must accept the consequences of his decision not to participate. He should not be rewarded for failing to appear. I agree with the Commission, but I cannot see how it affects the situation in which I find myself. The Respondent has lost the opportunity to address the issues in the inquiry. This applies as much to the constitutional issues as to any other issues in the case. I cannot see how this can be construed as an advantage or reward.\n[60] I find it regrettable that the Respondent refused to participate in the process. That does not deprive him of his right to a fair hearing, however, and I think it is incumbent on the Tribunal to see that the issues that arise on his side of the case are properly examined. The Respondent does not waive his right to a proper airing of the issues, or lose his fundamental freedoms under the Charter of Rights, simply by refusing to appear. Eldon Warman has his rights and freedoms, whether he wants them or not.Natural justice still applies.\n[61] There is no hiding from the fact that a Tribunal exercising its authority under section 54(1)(c) is setting limits on the scope of our freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The outstanding question is whether these limits can be justified under section 1 of the Charter. There are a number of points that could be made in this context.\n[62] The first point is that there are different forms of speech, which may attract different degrees of protection under the constitution. Even before the Charter, there were many judicial suggestions that Canada has an implied bill of rights, which protects political speech. This is important because the dialogue that Mr. Warman has participated in, over the internet, is fundamentally political. It may be pernicious and divisive. It is still a political dialogue.\n[63] The second point is that the Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act relating to hate messages in Taylor on the basis that the Act is remedial. At some point in the evolution of the law, I accordingly think that the Commission has an obligation to explain how section 54(1)(c) fits into the remedial scheme of the Act. The Tribunal has already recognized on a number of occasions that the penalty provision departs from the scheme of the Act.\n[64] There is nothing incidental in this. The penalty contemplated by section 54(1)(c) is inherently punitive. It is intended to deter those individuals who would attack the essential equality on which the relations in society are based. The magnitude of the penalty should not be minimized. A fine of ten thousand dollars for expressing one's views is no mean thing. It opens the Respondent to all the rigours of recovery and proceedings for contempt.\n[65] The situation might be different if the financial penalty could be construed as a form of aggravated damages, or some other form of compensation. There would be less of a question if the penalty was used to alleviate the problems associated with hate messages. I have been informed, however, that the money is payable to the Receiver General and goes into general revenue. It does not go into education, a victim's fund, or some other compensatory measure.\n[66] The third point is related to the ordinary distribution of adjudicative duties in our system of justice. This usually leaves the punishment of individuals who commit moral wrongs in the hands of the criminal courts. There are reasons for this. There are institutional safeguards in the criminal process, which make it a better forum in which to pursue a penalty against an individual for impermissible comments.\n[67] The proceedings before the Tribunal are in the nature of civil proceedings. The present complaint was filed by a private individual, against a private individual. The purpose of an inquiry under the Canadian Human Rights Act is not to measure the moral blame that attaches to a Respondent' s actions. It is to rectify discrimination. The task of imposing a punishment and assessing a pecuniary penalty falls outside the normal ambit of the Tribunal's responsibilities.\n[68] This explains some of the differences in the process in the two arenas. The burden in the criminal courts is beyond a reasonable doubt, as opposed to a balance of probabilities. It is apparent that a Tribunal could entertain some doubt as to the culpability of a respondent-I think culpability is the right word here-and still award the penalty under section 54(1)(c).There is nothing to prevent the Complainant or the Commission from seeking criminal charges, if they are warranted.\n[69] The constitutional issue is whether the Respondent's freedom of expression can be restricted in this kind of way, without the kind of institutional and procedural safeguards that exist in the criminal process. This includes a higher standard of proof, proof of mens rea, and the strict application of the rules of evidence. It is one thing to punish an individual after a trial in a criminal court, with all the protections that the law extends to the accused. It is another thing to do so, in a process designed for other purposes.\n[70] It would be wrong to say anything more at this point in the process. I simply want to set out some of the issues that need to be addressed, if the Complainant and the Commission wish to invoke the penalty provision. I feel obliged to add that all of these issues go to the public interest under s. 51 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. This suggests that the Commission, at least, has an obligation to address them.\nB. Range [71] There is a second kind of issue that arises under section 54(1)(c). That is arises out of the fact that the maximum penalty is reserved for the worst cases. There has to be a range. This poses a problem in the present case, since I have not been directed to a reliable source of precedents, on which I could determine where it should be placed in the spectrum of possible cases. I think that previous Tribunals have run into similar difficulties.\n[72] These concerns are highlighted by the fact that the present complaint was filed by a private complainant. It would be wrong to assess penalties against individual respondents on an ad hoc basis. I do not see how a Tribunal can assess a fair penalty against Eldon Warman without some means of determining how the present case compares with other cases that might arise under the provision. This could be provided by expert evidence, which would at least establish the nature and frequency of the hate material that is available on the internet.\n[73] There may also be precedents in the criminal law that provide a basis for analysis. There is, for example, the rather notorious case of R. v. Ahenakew, [2005] S.J. No. 439 (Sask. Prov. Ct.), now under appeal, in which the accused was convicted of promoting hatred for describing the Jewish people as a disease. The accused was fined 1,000 dollars. The contrast with the present case is troubling. Here, the Commission is asking for a fine of 10,000 dollars, in a civil process, in absentia, without the safeguards of the criminal process.\n[74] I only mention Ahenakew by way of illustration. I cannot say what would constitute an appropriate penalty in the case before me. My point is simply that the Commission has an obligation to provide the Tribunal with information that would establish where a case fits in the range of cases that might come before the Tribunal. One would nevertheless think that the penalties awarded in the criminal law and the law of human rights should be consistent. This is a question of proportionality.\n[75] I am aware that subs. 54(2) sets out a number of factors that must be considered by the Tribunal. Although this provides some useful criteria, it seems to me that any Tribunal cognizant of its obligations would have reference to these kinds of factors, with or without the statutory direction. It does not really matter. These kinds of factors cannot provide the benchmarks that are needed, to establish the necessary scale. This requires an analysis of specific sets of facts.\n[76] All of this is compounded, once again, by the complete absence of any submissions from the Respondent. I realize that the Respondent must be held accountable for this. This does not make an inappropriate fine any more appropriate, however, and is still a concern. I suspect that the real solution lies in compelling the Respondent to appear. This only suggests, however, that the exercise should be conducted in a forum where some form of attendance is mandatory.\nV. RULING A. Liability [77] I cannot see how the prima facie analysis in the case law applies to hate messages. It does not matter. The postings are offensive under section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Complainant and the Commission have met the required standard of proof and the complaint is substantiated.\n[78] The primary objective of section 13 is to remove repugnant and I daresay dangerous material from the public discourse. The real issue on liability is whether the material is offensive: issues of culpability are secondary and the responsibilities of the Tribunal consist primarily in keeping the channels of free speech clear of messages that threaten the normative foundations of our society.\n[79] The material before me undermines the principle that all people are equal. This is one of the axioms on which the legal and social order rests. Taken as a whole, the postings vilify the Jewish people. The theme is that Jews are part of an evil conspiracy. I think this feeds into a kind of racial, ethnic or religious enmity that presents dangers for society as a whole.\n[80] There is another factor. The material before me makes it clear that the respondent does not accept the legitimacy of the legal and political system. This is a subtext in the postings, which attack the validity of the laws that protect the members of minorities from discrimination, harassment and the overt expression of hate. I think this is an aggravating circumstance, which makes the material more offensive.\n[81] I make no comment on the political arguments that surface in the material before me. Eldon Warman lives in a free society and is entitled to his views, whatever I may think of them. I would not want to restrict the political discourse that is essential to the proper functioning of a free and democratic society.\n[82] The Tribunal should also be careful not to enter into the discussion of religious texts. Freedom of religion includes the freedom to dissent. I would nevertheless add that the promulgation of views that promote a contemptuous attitude towards fundamental religious tracts is likely to subject the groups that hold these texts sacred to hatred or contempt.\n[83] I have already issued an order to cease and desist. The Tribunal has been advised by the Commission that the material has been removed from the internet. The fundamental purposes of the Act have accordingly been met.\nB. Penalty [84] It will be apparent that I find myself unable to deal with the request for a penalty under section 54(1)(c) without further submissions. I am accordingly reserving my jurisdiction in the case for 30 days, to give the Complainant and the Commission an opportunity to decide whether they wish to respond to my concerns. If they wish to provide further submissions, I think they should provide constitutional notice under Rule 9(7) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's Rules of Procedure.\n[85] I am directing that Eldon Warman be provided with a copy of this decision, by substitutional service.\nSigned by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario September 23, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT998\/11804\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

Hadjis\n2005 CHRT 37 2005\/09\/30\n[1] The Complainant has brought a motion to amend his complaint. When he filed the complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on September 5, 2002, he was still a member of the Canadian Forces, the Respondent. He alleged in the complaint that on account of his disability (post-traumatic stress disorder), he was mistreated and harassed by his superiors, and was denied medical treatments to which he was entitled, the whole in breach of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act). In November 2002, two months after the complaint was filed, the Canadian Forces discharged the Complainant. On May 19, 2004, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry, pursuant to s. 49 of the Act.\n[2] The Complainant now wishes to amend his complaint to allege that his medical condition was a factor in the decision to discharge him. He claims that the discharge constitutes a discriminatory practice under s. 7 of the Act. He also claims that the discharge was made in retaliation for his having filed the complaint, in contravention of s. 14.1.\n[3] The Canadian Forces are contesting the motion. On a preliminary point, they contend that the motion should fail because the facts alleged are not supported by an affidavit. I do not share this view. The Tribunal's Rules of Procedure are not as formal as those of a court. Motions are not required to be supported by an affidavit (see Rule 3). Indeed, they need not follow any particular format. It is common for the Tribunal to receive motions by way of letters and even email messages. The main objective is to ensure that each party be given full and ample opportunity to be heard by the Tribunal.\n[4] The Canadian Forces point out that Complainant Counsel details several facts and events in the notice of motion to explain why the complaint was not amended earlier in the process, none of which have been proven by way of affidavit. However, the Canadian Forces, in their contestation, refer to numerous facts and incidents that allegedly occurred over the course of the complaint's progression, which are not supported by any affidavit either. It is important to note that the Complainant is not trying to prove his complaint at this time but to merely add several allegations to the complaint. Having taken all of the circumstances into account, I am satisfied that the Tribunal is in a position to address the motion to amend the complaint and the contestation, in a fair manner, based on the record before it. No additional evidence is required.\n[5] In Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, [2004] CHRT 2 at paras. 5 and 6, the Tribunal articulated some of the principles that have been derived from a number of decisions dealing with the question of amending complaints. To begin with, a human rights complaint is not like a criminal indictment. The Tribunal has the discretion to amend a complaint to deal with additional allegations, provided sufficient notice is given to the respondent so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself. It is not necessary for allegations of retaliation that arise after a complaint has been filed, to be made by way of separate proceedings. Rather, an amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the additional allegations could not possibly succeed.\n[6] The Canadian Forces contend that there is no connection between the Complainant's discharge and his human rights complaint. According to the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5, officers and non-commissioned members can only be discharged by the Chief of the Defence Staff or his designated officer, in accordance with the Administrative Orders of the Canadian Forces. The individuals who were involved in the discriminatory practices alleged in the complaint could therefore not have participated in the decision to release the Complainant. It is therefore unrealistic for the Complainant to suggest that there is a linkage between his discharge and the alleged discrimination.\n[7] In my view, the soundness of this argument can only be assessed after a full inquiry by the Tribunal into all of the facts. At this stage, the Complainant is merely seeking to add certain allegations, which he will have the burden of later proving at the hearing. It is not plain and obvious that the Complainant would not succeed with these allegations.\n[8] The Canadian Forces submit that the Complainant is attempting to short-circuit the human rights process as set out in the Act, by attempting to refer a complaint directly to the Tribunal without first having submitted it for consideration and investigation by the Commission. I disagree. The new facts being alleged do not constitute a complaint that is distinct from that which was originally filed with the Commission in 2002. Rather, these facts are an outgrowth of the alleged discriminatory practices that had occurred prior to the filing of the complaint. Essentially, the Complainant submits that the discrimination he experienced while employed by the Canadian Forces was also a factor in his subsequent discharge. He further alleges that his filing of the complaint was in and of itself a factor (an act of retaliation in breach of s. 14.1 of the Act). It is an ongoing series of events that is being asserted, not a separate unrelated occurrence.\n[9] As noted by the Tribunal in the case of Cook v. Onion Lake First Nations (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/77 at para. 17 (C.H.R.T.), issues arising out of the same set of factual circumstances should normally be heard together. However, an amendment to a complaint should not be granted where it would prejudice the respondent unfairly. Such prejudice must be real and significant (Cook, at para. 20). There must be actual prejudice. The Tribunal in Cook suggested that among the factors to be considered are delay and might include the loss of the Commission's investigation and conciliation processes.\n[10] In the present case, the Respondent does not dispute that the Complainant informed the Commission investigator of his discharge and that it was specifically mentioned in the investigator's report. However, the Complainant made known his intention to seek an amendment to the complaint in June 2005, over two and a half years after the discharge. The Canadian Forces claim that they will be prejudiced if the motion is granted, namely by having to prepare a defence to the new allegations.\n[11] I am not convinced that this constitutes a real and significant prejudice. In my opinion, the mere passage of many months or even years from the filing date of the original complaint does not necessarily mean that the addition of allegations will cause a respondent real and significant prejudice. As the Tribunal observed in Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, [2005] CHRT 1, at para. 10, the complaint form exists primarily for the purposes of the Commission. It is a necessary first step, which raises a set of facts that calls for further investigation. It is the Statement of Particulars (filed pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure), rather than the original complaint, that sets the more precise terms of the hearing. In the present case, neither the disclosure of documents nor the exchange of the statements of particulars has occurred as yet. We are still many months away from the hearing. There is ample time for the Canadian Forces to prepare their defence to the aspects of the Complaint raised in this motion to amend. Any specific concerns relating to the timeline can be addressed when the dates for disclosure and the hearing are set during the case management process.\n[12] Furthermore, I do not agree with the Canadian Forces' submission that they are prejudiced by the fact that the new allegations will not pass through the Commission's investigation and conciliation processes, as the original complaint had. The obvious benefit of these processes is the opportunity to resolve complaints at an early stage, before referral to the Tribunal. Once a complaint is referred, nothing prevents a respondent from bringing before the Tribunal any defences and explanations that it would have raised with the Commission investigator. In addition, the Tribunal's own mediation process offers parties the same opportunity to settle their dispute as the Commission's conciliation process.\n[13] This is all not to say that complainants should feel free to omit facts from their original complaints, based on a mistaken assumption that they have an absolute right to insert additional allegations later on. Such conduct could be viewed as abusive.\n[14] In the present circumstances, however, I am satisfied that the Complainant has not conducted himself in such a manner. The Complainant informed the Commission investigator of his discharge shortly after its occurrence. For some reason, the complaint was not amended at the time. That is of little consequence in the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, allowing the amendment to be made now will not result in a real or significant prejudice to the Canadian Forces.\n[15] The Canadian Forces have pointed out that as this amendment is being sought two and a half years after the Complainant's discharge, it is prescribed or time-barred. Pursuant to s. 41 (1) (e) of the Act, the Commission has the discretion to not deal with a complaint that is based more than one year, or such longer period as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint. This provision plainly relates to new complaints. However, a new complaint is not being advanced in the present case. The Commission has already exercised its discretion and referred the complaint to the Tribunal. The incidents raised in the amendment relate directly to the allegations already mentioned in the complaint. In granting the motion, no period is being extended. The Complainant is simply being permitted to complete his existing complaint to include facts that arose after its original formation.\n[16] For all these reasons, the Complainant's motion is granted. The Complaint is amended to include the following paragraphs as set out in the Complainant's submissions on the motion to amend:\n(1) The Complainant, Alain Parent, had an employment contract with the Canadian Forces that extended until 2019.\n(2) The Complainant considers his discharge from the Canadian Forces to be a discriminatory act based on his state of health, in contravention of s. 7, and an act of retaliation, in contravention of s. 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act;\n(3) The manner with which the Canadian Forces dealt with the Complainant, in terminating his employment and discriminating against him on account of his disability, resulted in the destruction of his career plan, for which he should be compensated.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 38 2005\/10\/05\n[1] Simone Sherman filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on January 21, 2000 alleging that her employer, Revenue Canada (now the Canada Revenue Agency, (the CRA)), discriminated against her by treating her differently, failing to accommodate her and finally, terminating her employment on the basis of her disability. On August 13, 2004, the Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for further inquiry.\n[2] Ms. Sherman's complaint of discrimination is part of a long-running dispute that has led to concurrent litigation in multiple forums. The problems began when Ms. Sherman suffered repetitive strain injuries resulting from her work as a Computer Audit Specialist with the CRA. At the heart of the various threads of litigation flowing from her injury is the question of whether the CRA has taken the appropriate actions to accommodate Ms. Sherman's physical restrictions.\n[3] Ms. Sherman is now seeking an order declaring that the findings of an Independent Third Party (ITP) reviewer, who reversed the CRA's decision to terminate her employment, are binding on this Tribunal by virtue of the doctrine of issue estoppel. The CRA, in response, has also argued that issue estoppel should apply, but that it should apply with respect to the findings of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (formerly the Workers' Compensation Board). On the face of it, the ITPR and Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) decisions would appear to contradict each other.\n[4] The issues raised in the present motion are as follows:\nDoes the doctrine of issue estoppel apply to the findings and conclusions of the ITP reviewer and\/or to the findings and conclusions in the WSIB decisions? If issue estoppel applies in either or both cases, should the Tribunal exercise its discretion not to apply the doctrine?\nI. DOES ISSUE ESTOPPEL APPLY TO THE ITPR AND\/OR THE WSIB DECISIONS? A. Factual Background [5] Sometime in about 1994, Ms. Sherman developed work-related repetitive strain injuries. She left work and was later awarded Workers' Compensation benefits.\n[6] In 1996, Ms. Sherman returned to work for four hours per day. Two different experts in ergonomic accommodation were retained at different periods in time to assist the CRA with its accommodation efforts. The process was fraught with difficulties.\n[7] In May, 1998, the WSIB decided to terminate Ms. Sherman's vocational rehabilitation services and her supplementary benefits. Both decisions were based on the WSIB's view that Ms. Sherman was capable of working full-time at accommodated duties with no income loss and that the CRA had largely fulfilled its accommodation requirements. Ms. Sherman has appealed both WSIB decisions but the matters have been held in abeyance.\n[8] Also, during the period between January, 1996 and August, 2000, events occurred which resulted in the filing of three grievances by Ms. Sherman's union. Those grievances relate to the termination of her injury on duty pay in September, 1997, her suspension without pay in July, 1998 and the denial of her request in May, 1998 to be returned to work with accommodation and retroactive pay. Some of the issues raised in Ms. Sherman's grievances are also raised in her human rights complaint.\n[9] In July 1998, Ms. Sherman also lodged an independent complaint against the CRA alleging that several of her supervisors had harassed her on the basis of her disability, abused their authority, and otherwise discriminated against her. She has requested that an independent third party investigation be conducted into her complaint. Ms. Sherman has refused the suggestion by the CRA that she incorporate her harassment complaint into her human rights complaint before this Tribunal.\n[10] On May 14, 1999, Ms. Sherman's employment was terminated for her refusal to complete a Functional Abilities Evaluation (FAE). This decision was subsequently rescinded by the CRA. However, in August 28, 2000, the CRA again terminated Ms. Sherman's employment citing her refusal to complete the FAE and her incapacity to perform the requirements of her position as the primary reasons for her dismissal.\n[11] Ms. Sherman contested her termination by way of an Independent Third Party Review. The ITPR is a relatively new process that was developed by the CRA pursuant to the authority of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Act S.C. 1999, c. 17. The process provides for an independent review of grievances relating to terminations, demotions, lay-offs and certain staffing actions.\n[12] On February 24, 2003, after a 19-day hearing preceded by numerous rulings on preliminary issues, the ITP Reviewer rendered his decision. He ordered that Ms. Sherman be reinstated to her pre-injury position with back pay and benefits, effective August 28, 2000. The Reviewer also found that the CRA's obligations to accommodate Ms. Sherman in her position had not been met and that these obligations would continue upon reinstatement.\n[13] Ms. Sherman subsequently brought a motion in the Federal Court for a mandamus order to compel the CRA to implement disputed aspects of the ITPR decision. Next, she brought a motion for a contempt order concerning the implementation of the mandamus order. The mandamus order was granted, but the motion for a contempt order has not yet been heard. Another motion for a mandamus order has been filed by Ms. Sherman in the Federal Court, but it has also not been heard yet.\n[14] In June 2004, Ms. Sherman's grievances proceeded to arbitration before the Public Service Staff Relations Board. In a preliminary ruling on August 27, 2004, the PSSRB held that issue estoppel applied to the nine determinations that underpinned the ITPR decision. The CRA has applied for judicial review of the PSSRB ruling on issue estoppel. A hearing on this application is expected shortly.\n[15] Before this Tribunal, the application of issue estoppel has once again been raised. For the reasons that follow, I find that although the criteria for issue estoppel are more likely to have been met with respect to the ITPR decision than the WSIB decisions, this is a case where it is appropriate to exercise my discretion not to apply the doctrine.\nB. Law and Analysis [16] Issue estoppel is meant to bring finality to litigation. It is a legal tool that has both practical and equitable goals. It is not only inefficient and expensive to continue to litigate the same issues between the same parties, it is also unfair to the successful party to have to fight the battle all over again. (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460)\n[17] In this case, however, the successful party, Ms. Sherman, is seeking to use the doctrine for a different purpose. She wants to use her win in the ITPR process to expedite the Tribunal's hearing on allegations of discrimination that were not within the jurisdiction of the other forums. She also hopes that it will enable her to obtain further relief for matters that were either determined in another forum or may, at some point, be determined in another forum. The question is whether this is an appropriate use of the doctrine of issue estoppel.\n[18] The CRA, on the other hand, is employing the doctrine in the traditional sense - as a shield to prevent Ms. Sherman from relitigating matters that it alleges were conclusively determined by the WSIB. The CRA also argues that the conditions for issue estoppel are not met with respect to the ITPR decision.\n[19] The two-part test for the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is now well-known: (1) the criteria for issue estoppel must be met; and (2) if the criteria are met, the Tribunal must determine, based on certain discretionary factors, whether it is appropriate, in the circumstances, to apply the doctrine (Danyluk, supra, at para 33).\n[20] The criteria to be met for the application of issue estoppel are as follows:\nthe same questions are being decided in both proceedings; the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel is a final decision; and the parties, or their privies, are the same.\n(i) The Same Questions [21] For the questions to be considered the same, they must have been so fundamental to the decision arrived at in the earlier proceeding that the decision could not stand without them (Angle v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248). Furthermore, this requirement of the doctrine is met only if, on careful analysis of the relevant facts and the applicable law, the answer to the specific questions in the earlier proceeding can be said to determine at least some of the issues in the subsequent proceeding (Heynen v. Frito Lay Canada Ltd. (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 776 at para. 20).\n[22] Issue estoppel applies to issues of fact, issues of law and issues of mixed fact and law. The same issue requirement may apply at two levels in proceedings. It may apply to the underlying or evidentiary findings on which the final determinations are made and it may apply to the final determinations themselves. (Minott v. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.)) In some cases, the application of issue estoppel will completely dispose of the matter in the subsequent proceeding. In other cases, it may simply narrow the issues to be determined. The parties argue that it is the latter result which would follow from a decision to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel in the present case.\nThe ITPR Decision\n[23] The question before the ITP reviewer was whether the CRA's decision to terminate Ms. Sherman's employment was reasonable. Framed in this way, the issue would not seem to be the same as whether Ms. Sherman's termination was discriminatory. However, when one examines the CRA's reasons for dismissing Ms. Sherman, it becomes apparent that the question of whether her termination was in accordance with human rights law was fundamental to the ITP reviewer's decision.\n[24] In reviewing the CRA's termination decision, the ITP reviewer was required to determine whether Ms. Sherman was disabled, whether she was capable of performing the duties of her position with or without accommodation, whether she had been provided with accommodation to the point of undue hardship, whether she cooperated with the efforts to accommodate her and whether the requirement of performing the Functional Abilities Evaluations was a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[25] The three issues raised in Ms. Sherman's human rights complaint are: (1) whether the termination of her employment was discriminatory; (2) whether the CRA failed to accommodate her disability, and; (3) whether she was treated in a differential manner on the basis of her disability during her employment.\n[26] The first two issues are the same as those dealt with by the ITP reviewer. However, the issues with regard to differential treatment are not entirely the same as those that were decided in the first proceedings. Ms. Sherman's allegations relating to differential treatment are that she was denied training opportunities, sent home on sick leave, suspended without pay, denied a promotion, not permitted to work at home and given different equipment because, at least in part, she was disabled. These issues were either not dealt with by the ITP reviewer because he lacked jurisdiction or they were dealt with collaterally by him in assessing the good faith efforts of the CRA to accommodate Ms. Sherman before dismissing her. Therefore, these issues do not fall within the same issue criterion of the doctrine.\n[27] While some of the motion materials submitted by Ms. Sherman seem to indicate that the inquiry before this Tribunal would be limited to the question of remedies, there are other indications that evidence will be led on the merits of the complaint. There is certainly no suggestion in the materials that Ms. Sherman has abandoned her interest in establishing the CRA's liability for the above-mentioned allegations with regard to differential treatment. Those allegations involve different issues from the ones that were determined by the ITP reviewer.\nThe WSIB Decisions\n[28] The CRA argues that the decisions of the WSIB address the same issues as those raised in Ms. Sherman's human rights complaint and therefore, this aspect of the test for issue estoppel has been met with respect to the WSIB decisions.\n[29] There are, in fact, three WSIB decisions. The ITP reviewer found that issue estoppel applied with respect to the findings in the first WSIB decision of January 30, 1996. However, the reviewer refused to apply the doctrine with respect to the second and third decisions because he held that the CRA had failed to raise the issue in a timely manner and to provide notice to Ms. Sherman.\n[30] Such is not the case in the present motion. The CRA has provided full and timely notice of its position with regard to this issue. It matters not that this was done by way of a response to Ms. Sherman's motion. The CRA argues that the second and third WSIB decisions are binding on the proceedings before this Tribunal.\n[31] In my view, the fundamental issues to be determined in the second and third WSIB decisions were different from those in the present complaint. The primary issues in those decisions were whether Ms. Sherman was entitled to vocational rehabilitation services or supplementary benefits. Although the WSIB had to consider, to some extent, whether the CRA had accommodated Ms. Sherman's disability, the question confronting the WSIB was whether the employer was sufficiently on track with its accommodation efforts to justify the WSIB's withdrawal from the process. This is quite different from the question raised in Ms. Sherman's human rights complaint, namely whether the CRA exhausted every viable accommodation option to the point of undue hardship (Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd. [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 45 at para. 159).\n(ii) Final Judicial Decisions [32] For the purposes of this aspect of the test, a decision will be considered judicial in nature if the decision-maker was capable of receiving and exercising adjudicative authority, and the decision was one that was required to be made in a judicial manner (Danyluk, supra, at para 47). A decision is made in a judicial manner if it is based on findings of fact and the application of objective legal standards to those facts (Danyluk, supra, at para 41).\n[33] A decision is final for the purposes of issue estoppel when the decision-making forum pronouncing it has no further jurisdiction to rehear the question or to vary or rescind a finding (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada, 2004) at 86).\nThe ITPR Decision\n[34] The ITPR process provides the authority for the reviewer's adjudicative responsibilities to be discharged in a judicial manner. Furthermore, I find that the ITPR decision was final and was required to be rendered in a judicial manner. Thus, I find that the ITPR decision meets this aspect of the test.\nThe WSIB Decisions\n[35] The second and third WSIB decisions are under appeal. However, Ms. Sherman has asked that they be held in abeyance pending the outcome of other proceedings. I do not think it is fair to hold this against the CRA.\n[36] In my view, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997, S.O. 1997, ch. 16 provides the WSIB with the authority to make judicial decisions. Moreover, I find that the Act requires Board decisions to be rendered in a judicial manner. Therefore, I find that this aspect of the test is also met with respect to the WSIB decisions.\n(iii) The Parties or their Privies are the Same [37] For the third requirement to be met, the parties or their privies must be the same. The parties to both the ITPR and the WSIB processes were Ms. Sherman and the CRA. In the proceedings before this Tribunal, there is an additional party that was not a party to the previous proceedings - the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[38] When the parties to the proceedings are not the same, this aspect of the test may still be met if one party was the privy of another in the previous proceeding(s). In order to be a privy, there must be a sufficient degree of common interest between the party and the privy to make it fair to bind the party to the determinations made in the previous proceedings. (Danyluk, supra, at para. 60). Decisions about whether there is a sufficient degree of mutual interest to say that one party was the privy of another must be made on a case-by-case basis (Smith, J. v. Canadian National Railway 2005 CHRT 22 at para. 28).\n[39] The Tribunal has been reluctant to find that the Commission was a privy of the complainant because of the impact that this will have on the Commission's ability to represent the public interest in proceedings before the Tribunal (Parisien v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, [2002] C.H.R.D. 23; and Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, [2002] C.H.R.D. 22).\n[40] However, in the present case the Commission has indicated that it will neither be participating in the present motion nor appearing at the hearing on this matter. This would suggest that in the Commission's opinion, there are no public interest issues to be raised beyond those raised by Ms. Sherman and the CRA either in the context of the present motion or in the context of the inquiry into the merits of the complaint. Thus, in this case I am of the view that there is sufficient commonality of interest between the Commission and Ms. Sherman to be able to say that they are privies of one and other. Therefore, this aspect of the test is met with respect to the ITPR and WSIB decisions.\nConclusion with Regard to the Test for Issue Estoppel\n[41] I conclude that the preconditions for the application of issue estoppel have been met with regard to the ITPR decision, but not with respect to the WSIB decisions.\nII. SHOULD THE DOCTRINE OF ISSUE ESTOPPEL APPLY IN THIS CASE? [42] In Danyluk, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the doctrine of issue estoppel should not be automatically applied once it has been determined that the preconditions have been met. Rather, tribunals must consider whether it is appropriate, in the particular circumstances of the case, to apply the doctrine having regard to a number of factors.\n[43] Since the preconditions for the application of issue estoppel have been met only with respect to the ITPR decision, my discussion of the discretionary factors will be limited to the context of that decision.\n[44] Some of the factors enunciated by the Supreme Court are applicable in the present circumstances and others are not. I will deal only with those that are applicable. Moreover, in light of the Supreme Court's statement in Danyluk that the list of discretionary factors is open, I have taken the liberty of considering an additional factor: whether the interests of justice will be served by the application of the doctrine.\n(i) The Wording of the Statute and the Purpose of the Legislation [45] The Guidelines for the Independent Third Party Review process provide for a review of management decisions under very limited circumstances. The scope of the relief which may be provided is also very limited. Moreover, there is no suggestion that the ITP reviewer has exclusive jurisdiction over the review of termination decisions.\n[46] In fact, Ms. Sherman filed her human rights complaint after the first CRA decision was made to terminate her employment. Thus, she was clearly aware that alternative forums to the ITPR process existed which could provide not only more comprehensive relief than the ITPR process, but which could also address the broader range of allegations stemming from the core issue in all her litigation - the allegedly discriminatory treatment by CRA based on her disability.\n[47] The problem with a system of concurrent jurisdiction in multiple forums is that parties like Ms. Sherman are faced with very difficult choices: should they put all their eggs in one basket and focus their efforts on obtaining a positive result in the forum that has the broadest jurisdiction and can provide the most comprehensive relief; or should they use the shotgun approach and hope that they will achieve success in at least one forum which can then be used, by means of the doctrine of issue estoppel, to obtain favourable decisions and relief in other forums?\n[48] In the present case, Ms. Sherman chose the latter approach. She has pursued a number of different avenues for redress. In some of those forums she has been successful, in others less so.\n[49] It is difficult to see how the goals of the doctrine of issue estoppel - achieving consistency and finality in litigation and encouraging the resolution of disputes in one forum - are served by allowing Ms. Sherman to use her successful decisions to obtain not only additional remedies, but also to assist her to make out additional components of her complaint in other forums. Recent jurisprudence on this issue has emphasized the principal that when several related issues emanate from a workplace dispute, they should be heard by one adjudicator, to the extent jurisdictionally possible, so that inconsistent results and remedies may be avoided (Ford Motor Co. of Canada v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) (Ont.C.A.) at para. 60).\n(ii) The Safeguards Available to the Parties in the Administrative Procedure [50] Another concern that I have relates to the procedural safeguards available to parties under the ITPR process. Although it is endowed with a significant number of procedural safeguards, the ITPR process appears to lack some of the powers necessary to ensure that the parties are able to know and meet the case before them. The ITP reviewer himself stated that the lack of authority in the ITPR Guidelines to summon witnesses and to demand document production constituted a significant handicap to the fact-finding process in complex matters such as Ms. Sherman's termination (page 34 of the ITPR decision). This is a consideration in determining whether to exercise the Tribunal's discretion to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel.\n(iii) Whether the Interests of Justice will be Served by the Application of the Doctrine [51] As has been noted, this case involves a multiplicity of proceedings in numerous forums some of which have resulted in decisions that conflict on important points, and some of which have yet to move to the hearing or decision-making stage. Indeed, after reviewing the voluminous documentation regarding the various proceedings, one is left with the distinct impression that the doctrine of issue estoppel simply cannot provide an expeditious shortcut through this patchwork of decisions and procedures.\n[52] Part of the difficulty is that Ms. Sherman is not simply asking the Tribunal to apply the previous determinations made by the ITP reviewer to the issue of additional remedies that were or are not now available to her in other forums. Rather, she is asking for an order that some fifty-four findings of the ITP reviewer, which cover a wide range of issues in the complaint, are binding on the Tribunal's decision with regard to other allegations of discrimination such as differential treatment. It is likely that in making determinations regarding the other allegations in the complaint and the appropriate remedies, the Tribunal will be required to make additional findings which are not covered by the ITPR decision. The evidence adduced to prove or refute those allegations may well stray into the realm of those facts that have already been established by the ITPR. Undoubtedly, then, there will be disagreements about whether evidence can be lead which relates to a point that has already been proved but which may be necessary to provide the context or to prove a fact that is still in issue. It is difficult to see how such controversies will assist the parties or the Tribunal to reach an expeditious and fair result on the merits of the complaint.\n[53] Moreover, at this stage in the process, without the benefit of having heard any evidence or argument, it seems imprudent of me to bind the Tribunal to certain determinations which may or may not accord with other evidence which will be led regarding the allegations that are still in issue.\nIII. CONCLUSION AND ORDER [54] Although the criteria for the application of issue estoppel have been met with respect to the ITPR decision, this is a case where, having regard to the factors enunciated in the Danyluk decision, it is appropriate to exercise my discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel. Given the multiplicity and complexity of the proceedings and decisions relating to the issues raised in the complaint, I do not believe that the interests of justice will be served by the application of the doctrine in the present case.\n[55] Accordingly Ms. Sherman's motion and the CRA's request, in response to the motion, to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel are denied.\nSigned by Karen A.

The Complaint [1] The Public Service Alliance of Canada filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on August 24, 1983, which reads as follows:\nIt is alleged that the Canada Post Corporation as Employer, has violated Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by paying employees in the male-dominated Postal Operations Group more than employees in the female-dominated Clerical and Regulatory Group for work of equal value. The wage rates of the male-dominated Postal Operations Group exceed those of the female-dominated Clerical and Regulatory Group by as much as 58.9 per cent for work of equal value. It is alleged that sex composition of the two groups has resulted in wage discrimination against the Clerical and Regulatory Group, contrary to Section 11.\nCorrective Action:\nThat all employees within the CR Group employed by Canada Post Corporation receive wages, as defined in paragraph 11(6) [now section 11(7)] of the Canadian Human Rights Act, equal to the wages of employees within the PO Group performing work of equal value. That this corrective action be made retroactive to October 16, 1981.\nB. The Investigation Stage [2] Once a complaint is received by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), the general procedures followed are those enunciated in the Canadian Human Rights Act1 (the Act).\n[3] When the Commission receives a complaint for filing under the Act, it may designate an investigator to conduct a preliminary review of the nature and details of the complaint. All parties to the complaint are involved in this review. The respondent's defences to the allegations in the complaint are an integral part of the review.\n[4] When this review is completed, the Commission has the authority to determine that a valid defence has been submitted by the respondent, and that the complaint, therefore, cannot be substantiated. Alternatively, the Commission has the authority to appoint a conciliator for the purpose of attempting to bring about a settlement of the complaint. A third option is for the Commission to refer the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for an inquiry involving all parties, including the Commission as a representative of the public interest.\n[5] In the case of a complaint brought under section 11 of the Act, the Commission's authority to conduct its investigation includes authority to gather pertinent job fact data. The Commission may request information from the respondent, such as lists of employees, job descriptions, and related job data including input from supervisory and management personnel and employee interviews. Even on-job-site observations may be requested.\n[6] The receipt of job fact data is crucial to the Commission's consideration of the complaint and its final recommendation based on the facts it has before it. The value of the work of the male and female employees cited in the complaint needs to be established and compared, as do the wages of the male and female employees. The evaluation process must include consideration of the four factors specified in subsection 11(2) of the Act, namely: skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions.\n[7] The Commission's usual practice is to undertake the work evaluation process using a job evaluation committee, and the employer's own existing evaluation plan, provided it is suitable for a complaint brought under section 11 of the Act. Failing this, the Commission must find an alternative job evaluation plan which is unbiased, gender neutral, and appropriate for the task.\n[8] The Commission must investigate, as well, the appropriateness of the comparator chosen and named in the complaint.\n[9] Ultimately, the Commission must make its preliminary comparison of the job values and wages between the complainant and the comparator groups named in the complaint. An Investigation Report, based on the Commission findings, will then be drafted. Once the parties involved have vetted it, a Final Investigation Report, with its recommendations, will be presented to the Commissioners of the Commission who will make the final decision regarding the Commission's involvement with the complaint.\n[10] In the case of the Complaint before this Tribunal, the Investigation Stage was prolonged. There were a number of reasons for this.\n[11] As early as 1982, even before the Complaint was filed, the complainant, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (the Alliance), and the respondent, Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post), had agreed to work jointly on the development of a job evaluation plan, known as System One.\n[12] Therefore, during 1984 and most of 1985, the Commission did not pursue its investigation of the Complaint actively. Instead, it made periodic checks on the state of the joint development of System One. Differences of opinion between the Alliance and Canada Post, including the withdrawal, at one point, of the Alliance from active participation in the evaluation development process, led to many delays and limited progress in developing the joint System One plan. Finally, the Commission decided to re-activate its investigation in October 1985.\n[13] From late 1985 and through 1986, the Commission was active in developing a Job Fact Sheet, a questionnaire intended for use in gathering current job data for the complainant positions - jobs in the Clerical and Regulatory Group (CR's), a group noted in the Complaint as \"female-dominated\", and for the named comparator positions - jobs in the Postal Operations Group (PO's), noted in the Complaint as \"male-dominated\".\n[14] During this time, Canada Post expressed serious concern to the Commission about the design and content of the proposed Job Fact Sheet. Additionally, Canada Post expressed to the Commission its reservations about the investigation process in general. The Commission had indicated that the Job Fact Sheet was to be answered by a sample of the CR group first. It was intended, eventually, to be a prime job data-gathering tool for the Commission's investigation.\n[15] At the same time that it was expressing its reservations about the Commission's investigation process, Canada Post did answer the Commission's requests for job data information by providing employee printouts and other information. It cautioned that job descriptions and organization charts which were required as attachments to the Job Fact Sheet would often be out-of-date. The Alliance advised the Commission that the job descriptions should be union-approved.\n[16] By December 1986, a sample of CR employees at Canada Post had completed the Job Fact Sheet, and had been interviewed by Commission staff, using an Interview Guide created by the Commission to clarify answers given on the Job Fact Sheet. Additionally, during the interview process, relevant supervisory staff had been interviewed to clarify answers given by the incumbents sampled.\n[17] From April to September 1987, a number of Commission staff evaluated the sample of 194 CR positions using the data collected in 1986. System One was the basis for these evaluations, although it was an uncompleted plan, and the Alliance had advised against its use for evaluation purposes. These evaluations were eventually set aside, and not used in the final investigation process.\n[18] Protracted correspondence, meetings and discussions ensued from late 1987 through to mid-1991 between the Commission and Canada Post concerning the sampling of, and job data collecting from, the PO comparator group. The Commission was unsuccessful in seeking the co-operation of the relevant comparator group unions to collect this information. Moreover, Canada Post questioned the size of the proposed sample of the PO comparator positions, and declined to have the Job Fact Sheet completed by PO employees on company time.\n[19] Meanwhile, the Alliance was increasingly concerned with the limited progress in the Commission's investigation of the Complaint. The Commission had threatened, on at least two occasions, to invoke section 58 of the Act, to obtain, from Canada Post, information it required to continue its investigation. Meetings involving senior managers from the Commission and from Canada Post were subsequently held, leading to the development, by the Commission, of a preliminary set of 10 \"generic\" PO job specifications.\n[20] Eventually, the Commission was able to finalize its 10 \"generic\" PO job specifications based upon data obtained from Canada Post. This took place from July to October 1991. Although Canada Post indicated that the creation of these \"generic\" jobs excluded several PO jobs, there never was a resolution to this difficulty. Intervening events, such as a union strike in August 1991, extended the investigation time even more. The Commission moved forward, pushed by the concerns of the Alliance which were made evident by its threat to bring an application for mandamus under the Act to compel the Commission to complete its investigation. Its staff commenced the evaluation of CR and PO Benchmark positions, after which the 10 \"generic\" PO jobs were to be evaluated and the original sample of 194 CR positions was to be re-evaluated.\n[21] In the midst of this activity, the Commission's senior investigator was temporarily re-assigned from his position as head of this investigation to address other priorities. To complete the work expeditiously, the PO Supervisory positions were dropped from the Complaint, and the CR sample was reduced from 194 to 93 positions. A consultant was added to Commission staff for the evaluation process which was using, as its evaluation tool, the XYZ Hay Job Evaluation Plan, an off-the-shelf plan. System One could not be used as it had never been accepted by the union, and it was never meant to be used to compare jobs represented by unions other than the Alliance. Moreover, Canada Post had also advised the Commission that System One would not be suitable for evaluating PO jobs.\n[22] The Commission completed its CR and PO job evaluations and its investigation work in November 1991. There was no briefing session with Canada Post before the draft Investigation Report was released to the parties on December 16, 1991, along with a request to submit any comments by January 6, 1992. Comments were submitted by both parties by late January 1992; the Commission's Final Investigation Report, dated January 24, 1992, did not incorporate any of them. The Final Report concluded that there was a demonstrable wage difference when comparing wages and job values in the male and female-dominated groups named in the Complaint. The Report recommended referral of the Complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Panel (now known as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal).\n[23] The Commissioners considered the Final Investigation Report and, having regard to all the circumstances of the Complaint, decided, on March 16, 1992, to institute an inquiry into the Complaint by means of a referral to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which would assign the matter to a specific Tribunal panel for a hearing.\n[24] The Tribunal panel was established on May 11, 1992, a Pre-hearing Conference was held September 21, 1992, and hearings and deliberations got underway on November 25, 1992. The written and oral submissions were completed on August 27, 2003, although written submissions concerning the Decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the `Airlines Case' [Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Air Canada, Canadian Airlines International Limited and Canadian Union of Public Employees (Airline Division), [2004] F.C.J. No. 483] were submitted in mid-August 2004. In June 2004, the original Chair of this Tribunal, Benjamin Schecter, resigned.\nC. Population Complainant and Comparator Groups\n[25] The Commission's Final Investigation Report, dated January 24, 1992, indicates that the total population (with the break-down by job category of each of the complainant and comparator\ngroups) was as follows (presumably as of a particular date during the Investigation Stage, although no effective date is mentioned in the Report):\nComplainant Group (Clerical and Regulatory Group)\nCR 2 260\nCR 3 950\nCR 4 950\nCR 5 150\nTotal Clerical and Regulatory Group 2,3l0\nComparator Group (Postal Operations Group)\nInternal Mail Processing and Complementary Postal Service Sub-group\nPO INT 2 1,283\nINT 3 2\nINT 4 18,020\nINT 5 1,205\n20,510\nExternal Mail Collection and Delivery Services Sub-group\nPO EXT 1 17,549\nEXT 2 2,224\nEXT 3 48\n19,821\nSupervisory Sub-group\nPO SUP 1 549\nSUP 2 1,343\nSUP 3 427\nSUP 4 331\nSUP 5 96\nSUP 6 22\n2,768\nTotal Postal Operations Group 43,099\n[26] By way of comparison, the total population levels of the complainant and comparator groups as presented in the documentation (undated) supporting the August 24, 1983 Complaint are as follows:\nClerical and Regulatory Group (Complainant) - CR's 2,316\nPostal Operations Group (Comparator) - PO's\nPO INT 25,056\nPO EXT 21,661\nPO SUP 4,195\nPO Total 50,912\nD. Setting and Context, 1981 through 1991 [27] To assist in understanding this lengthy and complex case, the Tribunal considers it important that the historical setting and context be identified. In particular, what was going on in the \"world\" in which all three parties were operating during the crucial years 1981 through 1991?\n[28] The Canadian Human Rights Act was enacted on July 14, 1977 and proclaimed in force on March 1, 1978. Section 11 of the Act took effect on March 1, 1978. When this Complaint was filed with the Commission on August 24, 1983, a number of other individual and group complaints alleging discrimination under section 11 of the Act had already been brought by the Alliance, and other public and private sector unions. Tribunals were appointed to hear some of the cases but the majority were settled after negotiation, using Commission facilitators, and with the consent of the Commission.\n[29] The Act, a quasi-constitutional human rights statute, enunciates general principles concerning the prohibition of discrimination on particular grounds. It established a Canadian Human Rights Commission which was given the authority to be actively involved in the evolution of the Act through its handling of complaints, and its development and issuance of Guidelines, under subsection 27(2). Additionally, the Commission was required to undertake or to support research programs relating to its duties, and to foster public understanding and recognition of the purposes of the Act, while discouraging and reducing the various discriminatory practices the Act addresses. All of this, undoubtedly, placed challenging demands on the Commission and its staff during this early period. At the same time, this was a period of increasingly tight fiscal management at both the provincial and federal levels of government.\n[30] Collective bargaining was introduced to the Canadian Public Service in March 1967 under the aegis of the Public Service Staff Relations Act2 (PSSRA) which provided that the government and the Public Service Commission had to promulgate and declare occupational job categories in groups, as a preliminary to formal unionization of government employees. Each job category had to be defined by listing the groups of employees making up that category. Employees at the Post Office, which was a Department of the Canadian government at the time, were included in the same categories and groups as employees in other government departments, except for employees who were directly involved in the handling of mail. This unique group bore the title, \"mail handlers\" and included postal clerks, letter carriers, mail dispatchers, supervisory mail handlers, and several other functions involved in the sortation and delivery of mail.\n[31] The daily movement of massive volumes of different types of mail in a country the size of Canada, with its different time zones and variety of climatic conditions, requires a vast, well-coordinated operational network. Inevitably, such a network includes thousands of corporate or contracted people and thousands of postal outlets in both urban and rural areas, in addition to many mail-processing facilities across the country. The state of employee relations is obviously a vital element in operating such a complex network successfully. Prior to the enactment of the PSSRA in 1967 and the subsequent certification of various unions to represent particular occupational groups of employees within the then Post Office Department, employees tended to be represented, informally, by staff associations. The earliest of such postal associations is believed to have been formed in 1889.\n[32] In the 1960's and 1970's, the Post Office Department experienced one of its most unsettled periods of labour relations. While this was a period when the postal code system was introduced (1971) and mechanized mail processing technology was evolving, it was also a period of many management-employee disputes leading to several major strikes.\n[33] The Post Office Department was succeeded by Canada Post Corporation with the proclamation of the Canada Post Corporation Act3 on October 16, 1981. One of the objects of the new Corporation, specified in the enabling legislation, was \"...the need to conduct its operations on a self-sustaining financial basis while providing a standard of service that will meet the needs of the people of Canada...\".4 Creation of the Crown Corporation appeared to have the support of all national political parties and most organized labour, business and consumer organizations. There also seemed to be a consensus that one of a number of desirable objectives for the new Corporation would be the reform of its collective bargaining structure in the interests of achieving labour peace.\n[34] Upon becoming a Crown Corporation, the bargaining units certified under the PSSRA were deemed to be bargaining units under the Canada Labour Code5, and the bargaining agents representing these bargaining units were to remain in place, presumably to provide a transitional period of relative stability and an opportunity for the new Corporation to reorganize. This did, however, pre-empt an early start to the reform of the collective bargaining process which was further delayed by the passage, in 1982, of the federal `6 and 5' cost control legislation. The Canada Labour Relations Board (CLRB) issued a policy statement in February 1984 calling for an overall review of the bargaining unit structure of the Corporation at an appropriate time in the future. This review finally got underway in May 1985 when the Corporation filed its application with the CLRB for study of the appropriateness of all of its then existing bargaining units.\n[35] The 1985 CLRB study took the form of a Bargaining Unit Review Process (BURP) with the first phase of hearings concluding in December 1987; CLRB's first decision was released on February 10, 1988. The CLRB heard from eight unions involving twenty-six bargaining units (representing about 58,000 employees), and ordered that they all be consolidated into four bargaining unions and four bargaining units. The four unions are as follows:\nCanadian Postmasters and Assistants Association (CPAA)\nCanadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), comprising the Letter Carriers Union of Canada (LCUC), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the General Labour and Trades Group, the General Services Group, and the original CUPW\nPublic Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), representing administrative, technical and professional employees, involving the combination of 15 separate units into one collective bargaining unit\nAssociation of Postal Officials of Canada (APOC), representing operational supervisory employees but excluding lead hands and first-line managers\n[36] It was not until 1988 that the bargaining unit consolidation occurred and the 1989-1992 round of labour negotiations was the first held with representatives of the consolidated units - some eight years after achieving Crown Corporation status. Understandably, while the BURP study was on-going, negotiations continued between the Corporation and the original 26 bargaining units. In fact, there were active negotiations during this period with LCUC, CUPW, CPAA, APOC and PSAC, some overlapping with each other and some with special mediation assistance. Despite vigorous negotiations, three strikes occurred in the 1980's, one of which involved PSAC.\n[37] The 1989-1992 round of negotiations between the Corporation and CUPW were particularly challenging for all parties, leading to unsuccessful mediation, rotating strikes and Parliamentary back-to-work legislation in 1991. Agreements were concluded during this same period with the other three unions - CPAA, APOC and PSAC - without work stoppages.\nII. LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND A. Nature of Human Rights Legislation [38] Human rights legislation is a child of the 1970's. Although at the beginning of the twentieth century, there had been demands, often by women, for equality rights, it would be decades before legislation, both provincial and federal, addressed discrimination in general.\n[39] Discrimination in the area of work was addressed after the First World War when the International Labour Organization was founded in 1919. At about that time, the Canadian government legislated a minimum wage for women.\n[40] The Universal Declaration of Human Rights6 was proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1948. It was viewed, at the time, as the first step in the formulation of an \"international bill of human rights\" that would have legal as well as moral force. Article 23 of this Declaration reads in part that \"[e]veryone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work\".\n[41] By 1951, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value was articulated by the International Labour Organization in its C100 Equal Remuneration Convention7. This Convention was ratified by Canada in 1972 and signalled Canada's commitment to the active pursuit of the human rights of workers, including the principle of \"equal pay for work of equal value\". This commitment was reaffirmed when Canada ratified in 1976 the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights8, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights9, and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights10. These United Nations Covenants made a reality of the dream for an \"International Bill of Human Rights\".\n[42] Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of everyone to \"[f]air wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work\".11\n[43] In 1970, Canada established a Royal Commission to inquire into the Status of Women. The Royal Commission's Report focused on continuing discrimination involving women in the workplace.12 Female participation in the Canadian workforce had continued to grow over the decades, increasing during the 20-year period 1960 - 1979 by the same percentage as it had taken sixty years to achieve between 1901 and 1961.\n[44] Canada's commitment to eliminate discrimination in the workplace was enlarged to include a broader definition of human rights by the promulgation of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1978 and, in 1981, by Canada's signing of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.13\n[45] The general goals of human rights legislation are the prevention of discrimination and the promotion of public education to eliminate discrimination. These goals are based on society's belief in equality rights for its members. After the fact, they are an attempt to make victims of discrimination \"whole\" either through consensual or mandated resolution. Dickson, C.J. noted in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892 that the general purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act, as set out in section 2, is \"...the promotion of equal opportunity unhindered by discriminatory practices...\".14\n[46] A legislative protection of human rights demands statutory interpretation which is broad and purposive, which is made in \"...a manner consistent with its overarching goals...\".15 In other words, an interpretation of human rights legislation must advance the purpose of that legislation to educate the public and to eradicate discrimination. To do this, the interpretation should give the legislation a generous reading, avoiding a narrow, overly technical analysis. Such an interpretation will construe the rights in the legislation broadly and liberally, while interpreting the legislation's restrictions and exceptions in a stricter manner.\n[47] The Supreme Court of Canada noted in Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150 that:\nHuman rights legislation is of a special nature and declares public policy regarding matters of general concern. It is not constitutional in nature in the sense that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed by the Legislature. It is, however, of such a nature that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed, nor may exceptions be created to its provisions, save by clear legislative pronouncement.16\n[48] This characterization of the Canadian Human Rights Act as quasi-constitutional demands a thoughtful and modern approach to its interpretation. The following commentary, taken from\nE.A. Dreidger, Construction of Statutes17and Ruth Sullivan, Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes18 indicates the modern, contextual approach to statutory interpretation:\n...the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.19\nThere is only one rule in modern interpretation, namely, courts are obliged to determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids. In other words, the courts must consider and take into account all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning.20\nThe meaning of words in legislation depends not only on their immediate context but also on a larger context which includes the Act as a whole and the statute as a whole. The presumptions of coherence and consistency apply not only to Acts dealing with the same subject but also, albeit with lesser force, to the entire body of statute law produced by a legislature...Therefore, other things being equal, interpretations that minimize the possibility of conflict or incoherence among different enactments are preferred.21\n[49] In addition to these commentaries, the Supreme Court has underlined the need to use the Interpretation Act, as did Iacobucci, J. when he indicated that:\nI also rely upon s. 10 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 219, which provides that every Act `shall be deemed to be remedial' and directs that every Act shall `receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit'.22\n[50] In addition to a consideration of the nature of human rights legislation, and the consequent principles of statute interpretation when dealing with such special legislation, this Tribunal must also, during its decision-making process, consider the history of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That history is examined in the next several paragraphs.\nB. History of the Canadian Human Rights Act [51] As already noted, the Canadian Human Rights Act was enacted in 1977, and proclaimed in force in early 1978. Even though over 25 years have passed, equality rights remain the subject of litigation and discussion. Mme Justice L'Heureux-Dube, speaking after receiving an Honourary LL.D. from the Law Society of Upper Canada in 2002, noted that:\nThe isms and phobias - racism, sexism, homophobia, and the malevolent rest - are all fountainheads of discrimination and harassment. They have no place in this era of human rights. ...Equality will be the battle of the millennium. At times, equality's standard bearers will feel like they are standing alone and will be harshly criticized for their positions. But, for those who do what is right, affirmation and solidarity come in due course. For it is my firm belief that justice without equality is no justice at all.23\n[52] Section 2 of the Canadian Human Rights Act addresses the goal of equality. It notes that the purpose of the Act is to:\n...give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[53] The Minister of Justice at the time, the Honourable Ron Basford, indicated in May 1977 during the Parliamentary debates which preceded the enactment of the Act, and more particularly, section 11 of the Act, that:\nThere will no doubt be some problems ...[with] the concept [of equal pay for work of equal value]. The federal government has adopted a different approach: that we should legislate the principle and, through the Commission and through its efforts at setting out guidelines, solve those problems...as to how that is to be implemented and how it is to be brought about.24\n[54] In other words, section 11 of the Act is an enunciation of a principle, without legislating stringent rules indicating how that principle is to be effected. The Honourable Ron Basford stated that this section of the proposed Act was fashioned to address the specific problem of the occupational segregation of women, with its accompanying historical lower wage rates which were based on the undervaluing of women's work in the marketplace. The need to address this problem had been one of the underlying reasons for the International Conventions of the mid-twentieth century, and was a key recommendation of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.25\n[55] From these International Conventions and the Royal Commission Report, the broad concept arose of basing wages on the value of work being done. Section 11 of the Act deals with the principle that there should be no discrimination in wage rates based on sex. The basis for the wage should be the value of the work being done.\n[56] As the Canadian commitment to International Conventions, and to the recommendations of its own federally-appointed Royal Commission, was addressed by section 11 of the Act, its purpose must be seen in that historical light.\n[57] Accordingly, section 11, although complaint-driven, as is the Act in general, may be interpreted as Parliament's means of addressing systemic discrimination based upon sex, in employment.\n[58] Although the principle of \"equal pay for work of equal value\" is the basis for section 11, the Act does not articulate how the principle is to be implemented. While section 11 spells out for the complainant the criteria to be used to assess value of work - that is, the composite of the four factors of skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions - the evaluation process to be employed is not articulated.\n[59] The Commission is given broad authority to deal with the intricacies of section 11, such as the ability to issue binding guidelines concerning certain concepts in the section. This guideline-making power creates what can be described as statutory rules to guide the interpretation of section 11, analogous to the creation of regulations for other legislation.\n[60] The Complaint before this Tribunal demands an interpretation of all aspects of section 11. It is believed to be the first complaint based on section 11 of the Act, referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, to require such a comprehensive review.\nIII. THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES [61] There are four fundamental issues to be addressed as the Tribunal examines this Complaint. These are identified below, and will be examined in detail in Sections IV, V and VI of this Decision.\nA. Independence and Impartiality of the Tribunal [62] Is the Tribunal an institutionally independent and impartial quasi-judicial body? In particular, does the Act create a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias in the Tribunal because it gives the Commission power to issue Equal Wages Guidelines26 (the Guidelines), which are binding on the Commission, a party before the Tribunal, and binding on the Tribunal?\nB. Retroactivity and Validity of the Guidelines [63] Can a statute be applied retroactively or retrospectively? Can a delegated power to issue subordinate legislation, such as the Guidelines, be exercised retroactively or retrospectively?\n[64] What is the test for the validity of subordinate legislation? Are subsection 8(2) and sections 11 to 15 of the 1986 Guidelines27 valid?\nC. Proof by Presumption [65] Evans, J. noted that:\n[S]ubsection 11(1) can ... be seen to have tackled the problem of proof by enacting a presumption that, when men and women are paid different wages for work of equal value, that difference is based on sex, unless it can be attributed to a factor identified by the Commission in a guideline as constituting a reasonable justification for it.28\n[66] Although all parties in this Complaint accept the above statement by Mr. Justice Evans, the question arises: Is this presumption a presumption rebuttable by factors other than those identified in the Guidelines?\nD. Prima Facie Case [67] Has the complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination, based on section 11 of the Act?\n[68] A prima facie case has been defined as follows:\n...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.29\n[69] The standard of proof to determine whether such a prima facie case has been established by the complainant is the civil standard, a balance of probabilities. Once a prima facie case has been established by the complainant, the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent to show a justification for the discrimination, using the balance of probabilities as the standard of proof.\nIV. EXAMINATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES A. Independence and Impartiality of the Tribunal [70] Canada Post first raised this issue in May 1998 when its newly retained counsel advised the Tribunal that a Motion concerning \"the judicial and institutional independence\" of the Tribunal was being considered.\n[71] The issue of the Tribunal's independence and impartiality had arisen after the release, on March 23, 1998, of a decision by McGillis, J. in the Federal Court (Trial Division).30\n[72] That decision was the culmination of a judicial review of a decision made by the tribunal appointed to hear a complaint, brought under section 11 of the Act by some Bell Canada employees and their unions. After hearing argument on Bell Canada's Motion requesting that the tribunal find itself unable to proceed due to an apprehension of bias, the tribunal ruled that it was \"...an independent quasi-judicial body, institutionally capable of providing a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of natural justice\".31\n[73] The judicial review application was allowed, the Federal Court concluding that the legislative scheme of the Act, at the time, did not provide tribunal members with sufficient security of tenure or financial security to allow the tribunal to operate with independence and impartiality. Of concern was a link between the tribunal members' remuneration and the Commission, which would be a party before most tribunals. Additionally, McGillis, J. indicated that there were concerns about the Commission's ability to make binding Guidelines. McGillis, J. commented, in obiter dicta, that \"...the manner in which, in the opinion of the Commission, any provision of this Act applies in a particular case...\" should cause concern for the ability of the tribunal to act independently and impartially.32 Such a problem could, suggested McGillis, J., be corrected by making the Guidelines non-binding on the tribunal.\n[74] Therefore, all proceedings in the Bell Canada complaint were quashed and an Order was rendered that no further proceedings in the complaint take place until legislative changes were made to address the relevant problems.\n[75] Canada Post brought its Motion in June 1998, requesting the following:\nan Order or ruling by the Tribunal that it is not an independent or impartial tribunal capable of providing a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by section 2(e) of the Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1985, because, inter alia, it is bound by the Guidelines in interpreting section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act issued by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, a party in interest before it; an Order or ruling by the Tribunal that it is not an independent or impartial tribunal capable of providing a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by section 2(e) of the Bill of Rights because the remuneration of the Tribunal's members is fixed by the Commission and, from the beginning of the Tribunal hearings until January 1, 1997, was provided to the members by cheques issued by the Commission; in the alternative, an Order by the Tribunal referring the questions raised above to the Federal Court under section 18.3 of the Federal Court Act R.S.C. 1985 c. F-7 and Rules 320 and 323 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998.\n[76] The Motion was argued in August\/September 1998. The Tribunal issued its decision on October 21, 1998, dismissing Canada Post's Motion, as follows:\nWith regard to the issues of financial security in a tribunal and the security of tenure of tribunal members, the Tribunal concludes that there is no question that waiver is available as an objection to an allegation of a reasonable apprehension of bias, as demonstrated by authorities cited.... One fact is indisputable. At no time during the last six years, did Mr. Juriansz, counsel for the Respondent, raise the issues of security of tenure or financial security of the Tribunal... The Tribunal concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondent would have had the knowledge to object, in a timely fashion, to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal based upon a reasonable apprehension of bias arising from these two issues. Therefore, because such an objection was never made, for whatever reason, the Respondent must be deemed to have impliedly waived its right to challenge the independence or impartiality of the Tribunal on the basis of the said two issues.33\n[77] Concerning Canada Post's argument that the binding nature of the Guidelines, created by the Commission, a party before the Tribunal, produced a situation where the Tribunal could not\nprovide a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, the Tribunal ruled as follows:\nWith respect to the binding nature of the Guidelines pursuant to section 27(3) of the Act, the Tribunal finds that from the outset of the hearing there was an undisputed understanding amongst the parties of the day to address this issue in final submissions, after hearing evidence of all the parties.\nAnother way of looking at this particular matter is that the exercising of the Respondent's right to object to the issue of the binding nature of the Guidelines on the grounds of invalidating the Tribunal's independence and impartiality, was postponed, by consent, from the start of the proceedings to closing argument, because all parties agreed it was wise that the Tribunal hear evidence first so the Tribunal would understand what the Guidelines were intended to accomplish.\nThe Respondent's right to object has, therefore, not been rescinded-- it has been reserved and remains in place to be exercised \"at the end of the day\". There is no question of waiver here. Nothing has been waived with respect to the Guidelines issue - just an understanding and concurrence openly and fairly arrived at, to address that issue later on.34\n[78] Accordingly, the Tribunal continued to hear evidence.\n[79] On June 30, 1998, a number of amendments to the Act came into effect, including the following:\nSubsection 27(2) provides for the Commission to issue a guideline binding on the Commission and a tribunal only \"in a class of cases described in the guideline\" rather than \"in a particular case or in a class of cases\".\nSubsection 48.2(2) recognizes that a tribunal member whose appointment expires \"... may, with the approval of the Chairperson, conclude any inquiry that the member has begun\".\nSubsection 48.6(1) provides that tribunal members shall be paid \"... such remuneration as may be fixed by the Governor in Council\" rather than \"... as may be prescribed by by-law of the Commission\".35\n[80] After the Act had been amended in June 1998, the Vice-Chairman of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decided to proceed with the tribunal hearing of the Bell Canada complaint. Bell Canada, however, maintained its position that, even with the amendment to subsection 27(2) of the Act, the tribunal was precluded from making an independent judgement in any class of cases in which binding Guidelines were issued by the Commission, a party in interest before the tribunal. It argued, in a judicial review application of the April 1999 decision36 to proceed with the Bell Canada hearing, that the binding nature of the Guidelines leads to an inevitable perception of bias and lack of institutional independence. Tremblay-Lamer, J. of the Federal Court (Trial Division) agreed. In a decision rendered on November 2, 2000, the binding nature of the Guidelines issued by the Commission was found to be incompatible with the guarantees of institutional independence and impartiality necessary to the tribunal's decision-making powers.37\n[81] The Federal Court of Appeal decision of May 24, 2001 reversed the decision of Tremblay-Lamer, J.38 This Appeal decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, which issued its decision on June 26, 2003.39 It found that subsections 27(2) and (3) of the Act, as amended, relating to the issuance of binding Guidelines, were not inconsistent with section 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44, which requires that parties be given a \"fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\". Neither were the subsections inconsistent with the constitutional principle of adjudicative independence. Therefore, those subsections of the Act were found to be operable and applicable.\n[82] The Supreme Court of Canada addressed Bell Canada's specific argument that the binding nature of the Guidelines creates a perception that a tribunal, hearing a complaint, lacks independence and impartiality. Further, Bell Canada had argued that guidelines, created by a party before it, and binding on the tribunal, would create an apprehension of bias. The Supreme Court noted the following:\nAs the Commission has readily acknowledged, the guideline power is constrained. The Commission, like other bodies to whom the power to make subordinate legislation has been delegated, cannot exceed the power that has been given to it and is subject to strict judicial review ... The Tribunal can, and indeed must, refuse to apply guidelines that it finds to be ultra vires the Commission as contrary to the Commission's enabling legislation, the Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights. The Tribunal's power to `decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter' under s. 50(2) of the Act is clearly a general power to consider questions of law; including questions pertaining to the Charter and the Canadian Bill of Rights ... No invalid law binds the Tribunal. Moreover, the Commission's guidelines, like all subordinate legislation, are subject to the presumption against retroactivity. Since the Act does not contain explicit language indicating an intent to dispense with this presumption, no guideline can apply retroactively. This is a significant bar to attempting to influence a case that is currently being prosecuted before the Tribunal by promulgating a new guideline. Finally, any party before the Tribunal could challenge a guideline on the basis that it was issued by the Commission in bad faith or for an improper purpose; and no guideline can purport to override the requirements of procedural fairness that govern the Tribunal.40\nParliament's choice was obviously that the Commission should exercise a delegated legislative function. Like all powers to make subordinate legislation, the Commission's guideline power under ss. 27(2) and 27(3) is strictly constrained. We fail to see, then, that the guideline power under the Act would lead an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, to apprehend a `real likelihood of bias'.41\n[83] Thus, the Supreme Court of Canada has answered the argument about the operation of the Guidelines and their impact upon the impartiality and independence of this Tribunal. That argument was left \"to the end of the day\" in the Tribunal's decision on Canada Post's 1998 Motion. The Supreme Court's lengthy discussion of the Commission's guideline-making power under the Act is as applicable to the power given to the Commission when the Act was first enacted as it is today.\n[84] In its oral submission on the Supreme Court's decision in the Bell Canada case, Canada Post maintained its stance that the Supreme Court decision did not address tribunals that were constituted and operating prior to the enactment of the 1998 amendments to the Act. Canada Post cited the opening paragraph of the Supreme Court decision in Bell Canada which identified the issue before the Court as being whether the Tribunal lacked independence and impartiality because of the power of the Commission to issue guidelines \"...concerning a `class of cases'...\" which would be binding on the tribunal.\n[85] The Supreme Court was therefore, according to Canada Post's submission, addressing post-1998 tribunals. It was not until the 1998 amendments that the Commission's guideline-making power was confined to a `class of cases'. Prior to the 1998 amendments, former subsection 27(2) of the Act authorized the issuance of guidelines in respect of `a particular case' as well as a `class of cases'.\n[86] Canada Post's argument was that the current Tribunal, having been established in 1992, was not encompassed by the Supreme Court's Bell Canada decision.\n[87] The Commission's position on this matter was that it had been specifically dealt with by the Federal Court of Appeal in the unanimous decision in Northwest Territories v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, [2001] F.C.J. No. 791. At paragraph 41 of that decision, the Federal Court of Appeal noted, as follows:\nThe appellant [Government of the Northwest Territories] contends that the amended provision still compromises the independence and impartiality of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel assigned to hearing the complaint against it. The appellant assumed, rightly so in my view, that subsection 27(3) as it now exists in its more restricted form due to the amendment to subsection 27(2) applies to the hearing of the complaint against it ... It is reasonable in the circumstances to infer that Parliament intended the new but more limited subsections 27(2) and (3) to continue to apply to inquiries in respect of a class of cases, such as this one, commenced before the amendment and continued thereafter, especially as the 1998 amendment was remedial and aimed at suppressing a possible violation of the requirements of natural justice. The combined effect of the amendment and the transitional provision was, on the one hand, to restrict the CHRC's power to issue binding guidelines to classes of cases and, on the other hand, to allow the guidelines already issued in respect of a class of cases to be binding on the three members of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel completing the inquiry in this case.\n[88] The Court of Appeal, in the Commission's view, concluded that the amended section 27 applied to the proceedings of the Northwest Territories case despite the fact that its tribunal had been appointed prior to the 1998 amendments. The panel continued under the transitional provisions of the Act while not interfering with the application of the amended Act. Also, no binding guidelines specific to the appellant's case had been issued by the Commission.\n[89] The Commission argued that, since the Northwest Territories case was governed by the same pre-1998 provisions as this Tribunal, the Court of Appeal's decision, which is uncontradicted by the Supreme Court's decision in Bell Canada, is equally applicable and, indeed, binding on this Tribunal.\n[90] As with the Northwest Territories case, this Tribunal continued under the Act's transitional provisions and was bound by the section 27 amendment of 1998. Finally, no case specific guideline had been issued by the Commission.\n[91] The Tribunal finds the Commission's submission to be more persuasive, and agrees that the Federal Court of Appeal decision in the Northwest Territories case is relevant and binding on its deliberations.\n[92] This Tribunal, for all the reasons noted in this Section, finds that it is, itself, an independent and impartial quasi-judicial body, capable of providing a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nB. Retroactivity and Validity of the Guidelines (i) Background [93] In addition to being a complete answer to Canada Post's argument concerning the binding nature of the Guidelines in relation to the independence and impartiality of the Tribunal, the Supreme Court of Canada has also, in its decision of June 200342, addressed the issue of the retroactivity and validity of the Guidelines.\n[94] As noted in paragraph [82], above, although the Guidelines are described as \"binding\" they are binding on the Tribunal only if they are not invalid, for \"no invalid law binds the Tribunal\". The Tribunal may find that the Guidelines have been drafted by the Commission in such a way that they \"exceed the power that has been given to it...[and are therefore,] ultra vires the Commission as contrary to the Commission's enabling legislation, the Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Canadian Bill of Rights\".\n[95] Additionally, the Supreme Court addressed the \"retroactivity\" of the Guidelines. It noted that:\n...the Commission's guidelines, like all subordinate legislation, are subject to the presumption against retroactivity. Since the Act does not contain explicit language indicating an intent to dispense with this presumption, no guideline can apply retroactively. This is a significant bar to attempting to influence a case that is currently being prosecuted before the Tribunal by promulgating a new guideline.43\n[96] As the Supreme Court also noted, \"...any party before the Tribunal could challenge a guideline on the basis that it was issued by the Commission in bad faith or for an improper purpose...\".44\n[97] Before this Tribunal, Canada Post argued, based upon its interpretation of the presumption against retroactivity, that the Guidelines which must be used for this Complaint are those which were in force at the time the Complaint was filed with the Commission in 1983. Therefore, the argument is that only the 1978 Guidelines (amended in 1982)45 should be of interest to this Tribunal in its decision-making process.\n[98] Additionally, Canada Post argued that, if the Tribunal rejects its submissions concerning retroactivity and accepts the 1986 Guidelines as pertinent to this Complaint, some of those 1986 Guidelines should be found to be invalid. Canada Post challenges the 1986 Guidelines, subsection 8(2), and sections 11 through 15.\n[99] There has been no challenge to a guideline based upon an argument that the guideline was promulgated in bad faith or for an improper purpose. Guidelines are promulgated only after the Commission has received input from various interest groups such as federally regulated companies, government agencies, and government departments. In this case, amongst those interested and actively involved in giving advice to the Commission before the promulgation of the 1986 Guidelines, was Canada Post.\n(ii) How is the Concept of \"retroactivity\" pertinent to this Complaint? a) Submissions of the Parties [100] All parties agree, in submissions concerning retroactivity, that, as Canada Post articulated in its submissions, \"retroactivity is a question of what law applies at a particular point in time\".46\n[101] As Canada Post noted in its submissions concerning retroactivity, administrative law academics, like Sullivan and Dreidger, have written volumes on the retroactive application of the law. In the words of Canada Post's counsel, \"a retroactive application of a law changes the past effects of a past situation, a situation giving rise to the effects is past and the effects are past\".47\n[102] Canada Post submissions continued, noting that:\na retrospective application of the law change[s] the future effects of past situations. The situation with which we are concerned is already past but the effects haven't all past (sic). Some are in the future, and if the law can change them it is a retrospective application ... An immediate application of the law changes the future effects of an ongoing situation ... the law applies as of the day it comes into force. So, anything that is happening after that, the law applies ... the prospective application of law, where the law that comes into force can only apply to situations and effects that arise after ...What about the situations that had already started before it came into effect?... The old law survives, the law that has been repealed, the Guideline that has been revoked, applies, but only for the limited purpose of governing the situations until they are over ... So, even though the Act says that Guidelines are revoked when new Guidelines are issued ... the concept of survival overrides that and let's (sic) the old law apply if it is necessary to do so because the new law is only prospective.48\n[103] These submissions by Canada Post outline the different applications of the law based on the timing of what Canada Post has called \"situations\" and the necessity that the law applicable to those \"situations\" be used. In its argument, Canada Post emphasized the prejudice which would accrue to any respondent who was unable to know, with specificity, what the complaint against him or her was. Without that knowledge, Canada Post argued, a respondent would be deprived of an ability to make a full answer to the complaint. The necessity for fairness to all is the foundation for the presumption against retroactivity. In general, Canada Post argued, the \"rules of the game\" must be known before the game is played; that is to say, a respondent must know what law is applicable at the time the respondent is served with a complaint, unless there is specific language in the legislation which allows for a change, \"mid-game\".\n[104] This argument anticipated the Supreme Court of Canada's review of retroactivity in the Bell Canada decision of June 2003. That decision specifically pointed to the lack of inclusion in the Canadian Human Rights Act of an intention that the Guidelines be applied retroactively. Therefore, the Guidelines cannot be applied retroactively.\n[105] If the Guidelines cannot be applied retroactively, what is the \"situation\" which pinpoints the time when a specific guideline is to be applied? During its submissions on this topic, Canada Post presented the hypothetical example of a contractual summer employment arrangement involving an hourly minimum wage rate which, through legislation in mid-summer, changed. In such a case, the wage rate changes when the legislation is promulgated, notwithstanding the contractual arrangement. The new wage rate is not retroactive to the beginning of the contract. This example involves specificity. There is a contract. There is a specific legislated change as of a specific date. There is no grey area in the example. An allegation of discrimination is not part of the equation.\n[106] Canada Post argued that, similarly, there is no grey area in the Complaint before this Tribunal. The date the Complaint was brought to the Commission should be the date which seals the law applicable to the Complaint. Canada Post argued that a respondent must know what law is applicable at the time the respondent faces a complaint. According to Canada Post, this is important because, from the time a complaint is made, a respondent must know what the rules are in order to articulate its position. During the investigation of a complaint, the respondent's position will be influenced by those \"rules\". If there is a change in the \"rules\" after a complaint is brought, Canada Post argued, the respondent will be prejudiced.\n[107] Canada Post made a further argument that employing the 1986 Guidelines would interfere with its vested right to rely on the defences it had under the 1978 Guidelines when the Complaint was first filed. In particular, Canada Post cited Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue49 to support the position that regardless of whether legislation is retroactive or even retrospective, it is presumed that there is no intention to interfere with vested rights (unless the legislature intends otherwise).\n[108] The protection of vested rights, argued Canada Post, is reinforced by the federal Interpretation Act where the term `enactment' includes a statute or a regulation. Section 43(c) of the Interpretation Act reads as follows:\n43. Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not...\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing, or incurred under the enactment so repealed...\n[109] Canada Post maintained that its vested rights would be infringed if the 1986 Guidelines were applicable because they impose on the Tribunal rules for interpreting section 11 of the Act which differ from the 1978 Guidelines rules in ways that are important to Canada Post's defence. Canada Post cited a number of such differences which it believed would produce an unfair result.\n[110] As already noted, all parties agreed that there is a presumption against retroactive application of legislation unless otherwise provided in the enabling statute. The Commission also agreed that, in the context of subordinate legislation, there is a legal restriction against such application rather than a presumption.\n[111] Further, the Commission agreed with Canada Post that the definition of retroactive application is the application of a new law to past facts. The Commission, however, stressed that the facts must be completed.\n[112] In referring to the temporal application of law, the Commission's submissions drew on Professor Sullivan's writings regarding the need to situate facts in time:\nLegislation clearly is retroactive if it applies to facts all of which have ended before it comes into force. Legislation clearly is prospective if it applies to facts all of which began after its coming into force. But what of on-going facts, facts in progress? These are either continuing facts, begun but not ended when the legislation comes into force, or successive facts, some occurring before and some after the commencement. The application of legislation to on-going facts is not retroactive because ... there is no attempt to reach into the past and alter the law or the rights of persons as of an earlier date...[emphasis added]50\n[113] It is therefore, in the Commission's view, important to identify the particular set of facts that is relevant to the case concerned. In the case before the Tribunal, it is a question of what facts were in play when the 1986 Guidelines came into force. The Commission argued that the facts at that time were clearly \"on-going\" because the Complaint addresses alleged systemic wage discrimination.\n[114] Drawing on Professor Sullivan's writings again, the Commission noted:\nSuch an application [to on-going facts] may affect existing rights and interests, but it is not retroactive. Legislation that applies to on-going facts is said to have \"immediate effect\"...51\n[115] The Commission emphasized the on-going nature of systemic discrimination by referring to a decision of Mr. Justice Hugessen:\nSystemic discrimination is a continuing phenomenon ... By its very nature, it extends over time.52\n[116] Consequently, the Commission concluded that when the 1986 Guidelines came into effect, they applied immediately and generally to all on-going facts - that is, facts that started in the past and continued to the present or future. The facts involved in an allegation of systemic wage discrimination would be such on-going facts.\n[117] The Commission argued, additionally, that the 1986 Guidelines did not apply new legal consequences to past facts, and did not change the past legal consequences of past facts. It was, therefore, not a retroactive application of the 1986 Guidelines. Rather, the 1986 Guidelines codified the evolving Commission practice concerning the interpretation of section 11 of the Act.\n[118] With respect to Canada Post's position that its vested rights would be infringed by the use of the 1986 Guidelines, the Commission argued that the concept of vested rights is not easily applied in the field of human rights adjudication. The Commission noted that the only cases cited by Canada Post in support of its position related to relevant facts that were in the past and were found in a torts context. This is in stark contrast with the Complaint which deals with on-going facts in a human rights context.\n[119] The Commission also argued that it is difficult to visualize how the 1986 Guidelines could interfere with pre-existing rights or impose new obligations on Canada Post, because the Guidelines simply interpret and give precision to rights and obligations that pre-existed their enactment. They do not in any way lead to changes in the law.\n[120] Moreover, the Commission asserted, the 1986 Guidelines did not remove any defences previously recognized by the 1978 Guidelines on which Canada Post might have wished to rely. In fact, the 1986 Guidelines added to the list of `reasonable factors' found in the 1978 Guidelines but Canada Post had not relied on any `reasonable factor' defences. Therefore, the change in the 1986 Guidelines concerning `reasonable factors' was not something which adversely affected Canada Post's position.\n[121] The Commission observed that the presumption against interference with vested rights normally involves ambiguity in the interpretation of statutes or regulations. The Commission's submission was that there is no ambiguity in this case, since the regulation-making power in section 27 of the Act makes it clear that guidelines apply immediately:\n27(3) A guideline issued under subsection (2) is, until it is revoked or modified, binding on the Commission and any member or panel assigned under...(emphasis added)\n[122] Finally, the Commission made the point that even if there were ambiguity, the presumption against interference with vested rights protects only those rights that had vested at the time of legislative or regulatory amendment. Not only is the legal scope of vested rights important, but also of import are the public policy issues that arise from the presumption.\n[123] In 2001, Marceau, J. noted in Veale v. Law Society of Alberta, that \"[t]here is no concrete definition of what constitutes a `vested right', primarily because it is difficult to generalize across the cases and as each case must be studied individually\".53 In speaking of the review of retrospective legislation, Marceau, J. indicated that judges are often faced with a policy conundrum - \"...whether to apply the new and improved law for the greater good even though this may be unfair to some, or to delay the application of that law in respect of some because of the injustice they would suffer\".54\n[124] The Commission argued that the 1986 Guidelines benefit the greater good by bringing much needed procedural detail to the interpretation of section 11 of the Act, while causing no injustice to Canada Post.\n[125] For all these reasons, the Commission concluded that the presumption against interference with vested rights does not apply in this instance.\nb) Tribunal's Analysis [126] Canada Post is clear in stating its position that neither a statute nor subordinate legislation can be applied retroactively, and the date this Complaint was brought to the Commission should be the date which seals the applicable law. Canada Post also argued that the 1986 Guidelines would infringe on its vested right to rely on defences it had under the 1978 Guidelines which were in effect when the Complaint was filed with the Commission in 1983. Hence, the 1978 Guidelines should prevail.\n[127] Put another way, Canada Post argued that its submissions were in accord with the Supreme Court of Canada's view, as noted in the Bell Canada decision, that the Guidelines can properly influence the outcome of future cases where no-one, including the Commission, can anticipate whose particular interests the Guidelines will favour. Canada Post argued that the Guidelines could improperly influence the outcome of a case where their particular impact is already known and their application is controlled by the Commission's timing of referring that case to a tribunal. Hence, the Guideline-making power cannot be interpreted to permit the Commission to apply a Guideline to a complaint it is already investigating when the Guideline is issued.\n[128] Thus, Canada Post argued that the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Bell Canada case supports Canada Post's position that the 1986 Guidelines should not apply to the Complaint because to do so would permit the Commission to influence, improperly, its outcome. The Commission was already investigating the Complaint when the 1986 Guidelines were introduced. By virtue of its decision to issue the 1986 Guidelines before referring the Complaint to the Tribunal, the Commission, in Canada Post's submission, controlled what the Tribunal was bound to apply to the Complaint, knowing its likely impact on the outcome of the Complaint.\n[129] Interestingly, while Canada Post, in its submissions (p. 14-15), stated that the Supreme Court decision \"...strongly supports Canada Post's position that the 1986 Guidelines should not apply to this Complaint at all because to do so would permit the Commission to improperly influence its outcome\", Canada Post did not cite any examples of such improper influence or even any hints of such improper influence by the Commission. It is presented simply as a possible threat of impropriety, a suggestion of a creation of possible bias or impartiality, without substantiation.\n[130] While agreeing with Canada Post that there is a presumption against retroactive application of legislation, and a legal restriction with respect to subordinate legislation, the Commission has argued, in line with Professor Sullivan's thesis, that the Complaint before this Tribunal deals with on-going facts. These facts relate to an allegation of on-going sexual discrimination in wages, as described in section 11 of the Act.\n[131] The Commission has maintained that the application of legislation, including subordinate legislation, to on-going facts is not retroactive because there is no attempt to alter past law or the rights of persons as of an earlier date. The Commission's position is that legislation or regulations that apply to on-going facts have immediate, not retroactive, effect.\n[132] With respect to Canada Post's point that its vested rights would be infringed if the 1986 Guidelines were applicable, the Commission dismissed this concern in the absence of any ambiguity in interpreting the statute and the Guidelines. The Commission was also of the view that Canada Post failed to demonstrate that the 1986 Guidelines removed any defences previously recognized by the 1978 Guidelines on which Canada Post might have wished to rely, at least with respect to the critical `reasonable factors'.\n[133] The Complaint before this Tribunal involves an allegation of sexual discrimination in wages, as described in section 11 of the Act. That allegation is one of systemic discrimination. Section 11 of the Act was drafted using, as its primary basis, the International Labour Organization's 1951 Convention 100 (ratified by Canada in 1972) as well as recommendations from the Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.55 These historical documents addressed the issue of systemic discrimination against women in the area of wages, with the most basic recommendation being that all wages be based on the value of the work being performed.\n[134] Systemic discrimination has been defined by the Supreme Court of Canada [C.N.R. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at 1139] as follows:\n...systemic discrimination in an employment context is discrimination that results from the simple operation of established procedures of recruitment, hiring and promotion, none of which is necessarily designed to promote discrimination. The discrimination is then reinforced by the very exclusion of the disadvantaged group because the exclusion fosters the belief, both within and outside the group, that the exclusion is the result of \"natural\" forces, for example, that women \"just can't do the job\" (see the Abella Report, pp. 9-10). To combat systemic discrimination, it is essential to create a climate in which both negative practices and negative attitudes can be challenged and discouraged.\n[135] The discrimination being alleged in the Complaint is, therefore, ongoing, by definition.\n[136] In addressing the issue of retroactivity, both Canada Post and the Commission have made reference to the Gustavson Drilling case and to Professor Sullivan's volume on Driedger on the Construction of Statutes.56 Some of these references have already been identified above, but, given the complexity of the subject, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine Professor Sullivan's relevant writings in greater depth.\n[137] Professor Sullivan states that the terms `retroactive' and `retrospective' are often used interchangeably but the growing trend is to define `retroactive' legislation as legislation that applies to past facts and changes the past legal consequences of completed transactions. `Retrospective' legislation changes the future consequences of completed transactions by imposing new liabilities or obligations.57 The Tribunal accepts use of the term `retroactive' as defined by Professor Sullivan.\n[138] Professor Sullivan indicates that the 1977 Gustavson Drilling decision confirmed that it is strongly presumed that legislation is not intended to have a retroactive application to facts that occurred before the legislation came into force. To apply this principle, Professor Sullivan writes that it is necessary to identify which facts are relevant to the legislation and to situate them in time relative to its effective date.\n[139] The relevant facts are the `fact-situation' of the case concerned, which, with respect to the case before this Tribunal, includes alleged systemic wage discrimination.\n[140] Situating the facts in time involves, in Professor Sullivan's model, determining whether the fact-situation is ephemeral, continuing or successive. She defines these choices as follows:\nEphemeral fact situations consist of facts that begin and end within a short period of time, such as actions or events. The facts are complete and become part of the past as soon as the action or event ends; the legal consequences attaching to the fact-situation are fixed as of that moment.\n(...)\nContinuing fact situations consist of one or more facts that endure over a period of time...A continuing fact can be any state of affairs or status or relationship that is capable of persisting over time ... Where no limit in time is stipulated, a continuing fact situation continues and does not become part of the past until the fact-situation itself - the state of affairs or condition or relationship - comes to an end.\n(...)\nSuccessive fact situations consist of facts, whether ephemeral or continuing, that occur at separate times ... A fact-pattern, defined in terms of successive facts, is not complete and does not become part of the past until the final fact in the series, whether ephemeral or continuing, comes to an end.58\n[141] Professor Sullivan goes on to say that once the fact-situation has been identified - and, in this case, the Tribunal considers it to be a continuing fact-situation - the test set out in the legislation must be applied to the relevant facts. An application is not retroactive unless all the relevant facts were past when the provision came into force. With respect to a state of affairs such as the on-going systemic wage discrimination alleged in this Complaint, the provision (in this case, the 1986 Guidelines) is not retroactive unless the state of affairs has ended before commencement of the provision. Clearly, the position of the Commission, supported by the Alliance, is that the alleged systemic discrimination state of affairs did not end when the 1986 Guidelines became effective.\n[142] The application of legislation, whether statutory or subordinate, to on-going facts or facts-in-progress, is not, according to Professor Sullivan, retroactive because \"...to use the language of Dickson, J. in the Gustavson Drilling case, there is no attempt to reach into the past and alter the law or the rights of persons as of an earlier date\".59\n[143] Professor Sullivan continues:\nLegislation that applies to on-going facts is said to have `immediate effect'. Its application is both immediate and general: `immediate' in the sense that the new rule operates from the moment of commencement, displacing whatever rule was formerly applicable to the relevant facts, and `general' in the sense that the new rule applies to all relevant facts, on-going as well as new.60\n[144] Although Canada Post submitted that to use the 1986 Guidelines to interpret section 11 of the Act for a complaint that originated in 1983 would amount to applying those Guidelines retroactively, the Tribunal finds that one is not dealing with the retroactivity of the 1986 Guidelines in this case. One is dealing with what Professor Sullivan has called a continuing \"state of affairs\" fact-situation. When the 1986 Guidelines came into effect they applied immediately and generally to all the on-going facts that started in the past and continued to the then-present and to the future. This included all facts involved in the alleged systemic wage discrimination.\n[145] Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the 1986 Guidelines are not being applied retroactively in this case, but are addressing an on-going, and continuing, fact-situation without being unfair or prejudicial to Canada Post.\n[146] It is appropriate to address the Commission argument, made after the Supreme Court of Canada's decision of June 2003 in the Bell Canada case. The Commission submitted that the relevant point in time for determining what law applies to a complaint is the date of its referral to a tribunal. This point in time was described by the Commission as \"the point of crystallization\".\n[147] The Commission stated that, once referral has been effected, new guidelines issued by the Commission during the life of a tribunal would not apply to the referred complaint. To do otherwise would constitute retroactive application of those new guidelines which is clearly unacceptable.\n[148] The Commission further argued that the Supreme Court of Canada, in paragraph 47 of its Bell Canada decision \"...appears to accept the position taken by the Commission before the Court that the referral date is the relevant cut-off point\".61 That paragraph acknowledges that the Guidelines, like all subordinate legislation, are subject to the presumption against retroactivity. The Supreme Court indicated that the presumption \"...is a significant bar to attempting to influence a case that is currently being prosecuted before the Tribunal by promulgating a new guideline\".62\n[149] Canada Post's arguments on this same Supreme Court decision underlined that the Supreme Court, while stating the principle that no guideline can apply retroactively, did not declare that the date of the referral to a tribunal is the point in time for determining what law applies to a complaint. The Court, according to Canada Post's argument, simply cited an example of a hypothetical case being considered before a tribunal and indicated that retroactivity could not apply as it would be improper, in such an example, to allow the Commission to influence the outcome of the case by means of the promulgation of a new guideline. Under such circumstances, the Commission would be a party before the tribunal and also the drafting agency for the new guideline which would be, according to the Act, binding on the tribunal.\n[150] The Tribunal finds Canada Post's argument to be the more persuasive one. The Tribunal does not consider the Supreme Court's decision in the Bell Canada case to have endorsed the date of a complaint's referral to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as the relevant cut-off point for determining what law applies to a complaint. Rather, the Supreme Court has cited but one obvious example to illustrate that the Commission's guideline-making power is constrained and cannot be applied retroactively. Moreover, the example underlines the Supreme Court's comment that a party is always at liberty to question the propriety of the Commission's guideline-making power, based on an argument that the guideline was made in bad faith or for an improper purpose.\n[151] Canada Post has also argued that neither the Commission nor the Alliance can fairly or legally rely on the 1986 Guidelines in addressing the Complaint because that reliance would interfere with Canada Post's vested right to rely on defences available to it as of the date the Complaint was filed in 1983.\n[152] Canada Post is arguing that the 1986 Guidelines impose on the Tribunal rules for interpreting section 11 of the Act which differ, in ways important to Canada Post's defences, from the rules that prevailed in the 1978 Guidelines. One of three examples of such differences mentioned by Canada Post was the ability, in the 1978 Guidelines, to include, when evaluating jobs, the value of overtime or shift work premiums. Since the 1986 Guidelines prohibit this inclusion, Canada Post argued that the latest Guidelines have removed a right of defence which was vested for Canada Post as of the date of the filing of the Complaint. This produces, according to Canada Post, an unfair result.\n[153] As already noted, the Commission, in its submissions on vested rights, referred to the 2001 decision of Marceau, J. in which he stated that \"[t]here is no concrete definition of what constitutes a `vested right', primarily because it is difficult to generalize across the cases and as each case must be studied individually...\".63 He also indicated that judges are often faced with a policy conundrum in addressing vested rights and may have to rule on the basis of the \"greater good\".64\n[154] To rule on the basis of the \"greater good\" introduces another dimension to the analysis. For example, are there features of the 1986 Guidelines that better benefit the \"greater good\" than the features of the 1978 Guidelines? Is this achievable without imposing unfairness on any of the parties?\n[155] Professor Sullivan states in her examination of vested rights the following:\nThe key to weighing the presumption against interference with vested rights is the degree of unfairness the interference would create in particular cases. Where the curtailment or abolition of a right seems particularly arbitrary or unfair, the courts require cogent evidence that the legislature contemplated and desired this result. Where the interference is less troubling, the presumption is easily rebutted.65\n[156] The Tribunal has, therefore, asked itself: Was the promulgation of the 1986 Guidelines unfair to Canada Post, given the 1983 date of the Complaint? Does the promulgation constitute an infringement of Canada Post's vested rights?\n[157] The Tribunal considers the period of 1983 to 1986 to be a part of the continuum that constitutes the life of this case. These three initial years should not be viewed in isolation but should be seen in the context of the continuing fact-situation that existed at the time the 1986 Guidelines came into force.\n[158] By 1986, although little had been accomplished amongst the parties in the investigation of the Complaint, all parties had kept one another apprised of work being done affecting the Complaint. For example, work continued by Canada Post and the Alliance in developing System One as a tool for evaluating the positions held by clerical staff at Canada Post. The Commission was informed of this work.\n[159] Furthermore, Canada Post and the Alliance were actively involved during this period in the Commission's attempts to retrieve data for its job evaluation process. In fact, interviews of sample CR incumbents had commenced just prior to the 1986 Guidelines becoming effective in November of that year.\n[160] The Tribunal has already established that the 1986 Guidelines are not retroactive and make no attempt to alter past law or the rights of anyone as of an earlier date. Rather, the 1986 Guidelines apply to the on-going fact-situation with immediate effect.\n[161] The 1986 Guidelines had come into effect on November 18, 1986, long before the Commission referred this Complaint, on March 16, 1992, to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for a hearing. The Commission had played a role in the discussions amongst the parties as the Complaint moved through the Investigation Stage. Many of the matters discussed by the parties before 1986 involved issues which later became part of the 1986 Guidelines, such as occupational groups and methods of job evaluation, including assessment of value.\n[162] There was, therefore, an understanding, by all concerned, of the Complaint as originally drafted. Although the 1986 Guidelines represent a significant change from the 1978 Guidelines, their introduction did little more than codify some of the Commission's procedures with which all parties had been dealing from the date of the Complaint. The wording of the Complaint, itself, exemplifies the historical nature of these procedures, as it speaks of female and male-dominated occupational groups, and the wages paid to employees within these groups. These procedures are not a part of the Act, nor were they a part of the 1978 Guidelines. They are, however, a part of the 1986 Guidelines.\n[163] Real unfairness or prejudice would arise, as the Supreme Court indicated, if guidelines which were pertinent to a complaint already sent to be heard by a tribunal were promulgated after its referral to that tribunal. Even in complaints under section 11 of the Act, the Commission could, by promulgation of guidelines during the life of a tribunal, influence its outcome. That is not what happened in this case.\n[164] With respect to Canada Post's example of the 1986 Guidelines' exclusion of overtime or shift work premiums from the value of work being an infringement of its vested rights, the Tribunal prefers the Commission's submission. The Commission indicated in submissions that this is an example of a neutral policy \"trade-off\". The complainant does not include the overtime or shift work premium in the value of wages, while the employer does not include overtime or shift work in its job point value. It is not an example of the removal of a Canada Post right of defence.\n[165] In terms of the \"greater good\" argument, the Tribunal accepts that the Commission's promulgation of the 1986 Guidelines was an attempt to bring much needed clarification to the interpretation of section 11 of the Act, without injustice to any party. The creation of the Guidelines was completed after many years of consultation with companies and organizations, including Canada Post itself. The Tribunal accepts that the Commission's decision to create new guidelines in 1986 was for the benefit of the \"greater good\".\n[166] Therefore, the Tribunal fails to understand how the introduction of the 1986 Guidelines after the presentation of the Complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission has been unfair or prejudicial to Canada Post, an infringement on its vested rights, or an improper influence upon the outcome of the Complaint before this Tribunal.\n[167] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the 1986 Guidelines are applicable to the issues to be addressed in the current Complaint. The question of the retroactivity of these Guidelines is not applicable to this Complaint, brought under section 11 of the Act. The facts involved are on-going, or continuing, and, as such, do not give rise to a concern about retroactivity. Additionally, the Tribunal finds that there is no infringement of Canada Post's vested rights because of the applicability of the 1986 Guidelines.\n(iii) Are subsection 8(2) and sections 11-15 of the 1986 Guidelines Valid? a) Submissions of the Parties [168] All parties agreed that the Guidelines are subordinate legislation, created under the power given to the Canadian Human Rights Commission by section 27 of the Act, and as such, must not be in conflict with the Act. There is, however, a presumption that subordinate legislation is valid. When a party challenges subordinate legislation, the onus is on that party to convince the decision-maker that the subordinate legislation being challenged is invalid. The question to be answered by the decision-maker is a question of law.\n[169] In this Complaint, Canada Post has challenged subsection 8(2) and sections 11 to 15 inclusive, of the 1986 Guidelines, based on its argument that a simple reading of the Act, giving straight-forward meaning to the words of the Act, and section 11 in particular, creates an inconsistency with the words and meaning in the challenged sections of the 1986 Guidelines. It is this lack of cohesion between the words and meaning of section 11 of the Act, as interpreted by Canada Post, and the words and meaning of those sections of the 1986 Guidelines, the subordinate legislation, which creates, according to Canada Post, a situation where the Commission has not exercised its power under section 27 of the Act in a reasonable manner, and thus caused those sections of the 1986 Guidelines to be invalid.\n[170] The parties' submissions dealt with what should be the acceptable approach to determine validity of guidelines. Once argument was heard concerning the test for validity, further submissions were made by each party concerning its position on the issue of the validity of sections of the Guidelines impugned by Canada Post.\n[171] Canada Post and the Commission both referred to the Oldman River case66, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which addressed statute interpretation, specifically in the context of a situation where there were two federal statutes and a subordinate Guidelines Order involved.\n[172] Quoting from the work of Professor Ruth Sullivan, Canada Post urged the Tribunal to separate the enabling legislation and its subordinate regulations (or in this case, the Guidelines) before determining the validity of the latter. It noted Sullivan's words, as follows:\nStatutes are paramount over regulations... The presumption of coherence applies to regulations as well as to statutes. It is presumed that regulatory provisions are meant to work together, not only with their own enabling legislation but with other Acts and other regulations as well.67\n[173] Canada Post submitted that, when testing the validity of challenged subordinate legislation, the Guidelines, the Tribunal must first construe the enabling legislation, and then assess the validity of the impugned sections of the Guidelines. Canada Post considered that this methodology is different from that espoused by the Commission's arguments.\n[174] The Commission's argument concerning statute interpretation in the face of a challenge to subordinate legislation also drew on the Oldman River case. It cited the following to underline its submissions concerning the test to be made for the validity of the impugned sections of the Guidelines:\nThe basic principles of law are not in doubt. Just as subordinate legislation cannot conflict with its parent legislation ... so too it cannot conflict with other Acts of Parliament, ... unless a statute so authorizes... Ordinarily, then, an Act of Parliament must prevail over inconsistent or conflicting subordinate legislation. However, as a matter of construction a court will, where possible, prefer an interpretation that permits reconciliation of the two. `Inconsistency' in this context refers to a situation where two legislative enactments cannot stand together.68\n[175] The Commission argued that, in line with the Oldman River case and with the writings of Professor Sullivan, the presumption of coherence presumes that regulatory provisions are meant to work together with their parent legislation as well as with other Acts and regulations.\n[176] The Commission submission pointed to what it perceived to be Canada Post's argument that this presumption of cohesion disappears once there has been a challenge to the validity of subordinate legislation. The Commission argued that were this to be the case, there would no longer be a recognition of the importance of seeking reconciliation of differences as was underlined in the Oldman River case.\n[177] The Commission argued that it is immaterial whether one takes its approach of reading the enabling legislation and the subordinate legislation together, or Canada Post's approach of first construing the enabling legislation and then addressing the subordinate legislation. The important part of the exercise is to test whether there is a consistency and a cohesion between the two levels of legislation.\n[178] To begin such an interpretive exercise, section 11 and subsections 27(2), (3) and (4) of the Act and the challenged subsection 8(2) and sections 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the 1986 Guidelines, read as follows:\nCanadian Human Rights Act\nEqual wages\n11(1) It is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value.\nAssessment of value of work\n11(2) In assessing the value of work performed by employees employed in the same establishment, the criterion to be applied is the composite of the skill, effort and responsibility required in the performance of the work and the conditions under which the work is performed.\nSeparate establishments\n11(3) Separate establishments established or maintained by an employer solely or principally for the purpose of establishing or maintaining differences in wages between male and female employees shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be the same establishment.\nDifferent wages based on prescribed reasonable factors\n11(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1), it is not a discriminatory practice to pay to male and female employees different wages if the difference is based on a factor prescribed by guidelines, issued by the Canadian Human Rights Commission pursuant to subsection 27(2), to be a reasonable factor that justifies the difference.\nIdem\n11(5) For greater certainty, sex does not constitute a reasonable factor justifying a difference in wages.\nNo reduction of wages\n11(6) An employer shall not reduce wages in order to eliminate a discriminatory practice described in this section.\nDefinition of \"wages\"\n11(7) For the purposes of this section, \"wages\" means any form of remuneration payable for work performed by an individual and includes\n(a) salaries, commissions, vacation pay, dismissal wages and bonuses;\n(b) reasonable value for board, rent, housing and lodging;\n(c) payments in kind;\n(d) employer contributions to pension funds or plans, long-term disability plans and all forms of health insurance plans; and\n(e) any other advantage received directly or indirectly from the individual's employer.\nPowers, duties and functions [of the Commission]\nGuidelines\n27(2) The Commission may, on application or on its own initiative, by order, issue a guideline setting out the extent to which and the manner in which, in the opinion of the Commission, any provision of this Act applies in a class of cases described in the guideline.\nGuideline binding\n27(3) A guideline issued under subsection (2) is, until it is revoked or modified, binding on the Commission and any member or panel assigned under subsection 49(2) with respect to the resolution of a complaint under Part III regarding a case falling within the description contained in the guideline.\nPublication\n27(4) Each guideline issued under subsection (2) shall be published in Part II of the Canada Gazette.\nEqual Wages Guidelines, 1986\nAssessment of Value - Working Conditions\n8(2) For the purposes of subsection 11(2) of the Act, the requirement to work overtime or to work shifts is not to be considered in assessing working conditions where a wage, in excess of the basic wage, is paid for that overtime or shift work.\nComplaints by Individuals\n11(1) Where a complaint alleging a difference in wages is filed by or on behalf of an individual who is a member of an identifiable occupational group, the composition of the group according to sex is a factor in determining whether the practice complained of is discriminatory on the ground of sex.\n(2) In the case of a complaint by an individual, where at least two other employees of the establishment perform work of equal value, the weighted average wage paid to those employees shall be used to calculate the adjustment to the complainant's wages.\nComplaints by Groups\n12 Where a complaint alleging different wages is filed by or on behalf of an identifiable occupational group, the group must be predominantly of one sex and the group to which the comparison is made must be predominantly of the other sex.\n13 For the purposes of section 12, an occupational group is composed predominantly of one sex where the number of members of that sex constituted, for the year immediately preceding the day on which the complaint is filed, at least\n(a) 70 per cent of the occupational group, if the group has less than 100 members;\n(b) 60 per cent of the occupational group, if the group has from 100 to 500 members; and\n(c) 55 per cent of the occupational group, if the group has more than 500 members.\n14 Where a comparison is made between the occupational group that filed a complaint alleging a difference in wages and other occupational groups, those other groups are deemed to be one group.\n15(1) Where a complaint alleging a difference in wages between an occupational group and any other occupational group is filed and a direct comparison of the value of the work performed and the wages received by employees of the occupational group cannot be made, for the purposes of section 11 of the Act, the work performed and the wages received by the employees of each occupational group may be compared indirectly.\n15(2) For the purposes of comparing wages received by employees of the occupational groups referred to in subsection (1), the wage curve of the other occupational group referred to in that subsection shall be used to establish the difference in wages, if any, between the employees of the occupational group on behalf of which the complaint is made and the other occupational group.\n[179] Canada Post submitted that its interpretation of section 11 of the Act is purposive, broad and liberal while, at the same time, follows the modern approach to statute interpretation. The latter demands that the decision-maker read the words of the statute \"in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\".69\n[180] In subsection 11(1), the words which have elicited a marked difference of interpretation amongst the parties are \"male and female employees\". Canada Post submitted that this phrase, seminal to the whole of section 11, means what it says. It is talking about discrimination between employees who are either men or women, and not between groups of people made up of men and of women. The discrimination is based on sex, and manifests itself in a difference in wages paid to the men and women involved.\n[181] Canada Post submitted that the focus of concern in section 11 of the Act is sex discrimination between individual men and women as seen in the difference in wages paid by employers to those men and those women for the work they do. If this interpretation is accepted, sections 11 through 15 of the Guidelines must be invalid because they do not relate to section 11 of the Act in any way. Subsection 11(1), so interpreted, does not speak of occupational groups and of the need to determine the gender percentage of those groups in order to classify them as either \"male-dominated\" or \"female-dominated\". Therefore, the concerns addressed by sections 11 through 15 of the Guidelines would not be applicable at all. Those sections would represent the promulgation of guidelines by the Commission which are not consistent with the underlying statute. Therefore, they would be invalid.\n[182] Canada Post's ordinary meaning interpretation of subsection 11(1) might read as follows, according to its submissions:\nIt's a discriminatory practice ... something that is prohibited, for an employer to establish and maintain, that is, to exercise some creation or some power to create or continue, differences, that is higher and lower wages ... between two people, two classes of people, male employees and female employees...between employees who are men and employees who are women...employed in the same establishment ... [which] means subject to a common wage and personnel policy ... There is only a difference of wages that's prohibited if the employees, the male and female employees in the same establishment, are performing work, their work, their individual work of equal value...70\n[183] Canada Post argued that a complaint, based upon section 11 so interpreted, could be made by any individual, man or woman, or by any group of men or women, without the constraint of artificial barriers against persons who are employed in occupational groups whose work is classified as gender neutral or \"male\". The complaint mechanism would become more accessible to all employees. Therefore, the general purpose of the Act, to eliminate discrimination based upon, inter alia, sex, would be advanced. The restriction, argued Canada Post, which is created by the Commission's interpretation of section 11, especially in its promulgation of sections 11 through 15 of the Guidelines, would be removed.\n[184] Of more import, however, according to Canada Post, is the Commission's apparent transforming of the plain language of subsection 11(1) of the Act into a completely different approach to the concept of \"equal pay for work of equal value\" through the use of the Guidelines. Instead of dealing with discrimination based on gender in the arena of wages, the Commission, according to Canada Post, has interpreted section 11 to be focused on discrimination based on the undervaluation of women's work in segregated occupational groups. In other words, the Commission has decided that section 11 of the Act addresses the concept of \"pay equity\". Once the Commission decided to deal with section 11 in that manner, it had to define the occupational groups.\n[185] The basis of Canada Post's submissions concerning the interpretation of section 11 of the Act is that the section is not about \"pay equity\". The \"work of equal value\" which must be compared in order to prove the discriminatory practice being denounced by section 11 is the work of each of the men and each of the women employees involved in the complaint. The section does not address the work of occupational groups made up of men and women who are doing \"women's work\" or \"men's work\".\n[186] Canada Post submitted that its interpretation of section 11 is a natural progression, historically, from previous legislation which addressed discrimination against working women. The first such legislation, early in the twentieth century, was a minimum wage for women employees. That was followed, decades later, by legislation denouncing the practice of paying women lower wages for work which was found to be either the same, or substantially similar, to work being done by men. Although this natural progression could lead, eventually, to the concept of \"pay equity\", Canada Post's argument is that section 11 cannot be interpreted as a movement on the continuum to that point.\n[187] Canada Post's submission was that section 11 of the Act cannot be characterized as addressing the concept of \"pay equity\". Canada Post emphasized, in its final argument, that provincial legislation concerning \"pay equity\" is specific in nature. There is usually a separate provincial Act which is entitled a \"Pay Equity Act\". The concept is not incorporated into provincial human rights legislation because, generally, it is not complaint-driven but rather is a mandated concept carrying specific methodologies and rules for its implementation.\n[188] Canada Post argued that the process of dealing with \"pay equity\" derives its ideas from academic studies and literature which has evolved concerning this abstract concept. The methodology is based upon job classes which are predominantly female or predominantly male because the purpose of \"pay equity\" studies, and eventually, \"pay equity\" legislation, is to address the inequities which have evolved in employment due to occupational segregation and the undervaluing of predominantly female occupations. Canada Post's argument continued, however, to stress that the Canadian Human Rights Act is concerned with the difference in wages between men and women based on gender discrimination not the broad concept of \"pay equity\". The Act is, according to Canada Post, concerned about protecting individuals from disadvantage or discrimination resulting from fundamental individual characteristics.\n[189] Canada Post's submission was that the Act has been promulgated for the benefit of individuals in Canadian society. The purpose of the Act, as set out in section 2, underlines that this human rights legislation was created so that \"...all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have...\". The grounds for discrimination which are listed in the Act are characteristics of individuals. Section 3 of the Act specifically indicates that the list of grounds is \"[f]or all purposes of this Act\". As one reads further in the Act, each section follows the next to speak of \"individuals\" or \"employees\".\n[190] This commonality is broken by section 11 of the Act which does not speak of an individual employee or a group of employees, but addresses discrimination involving \"male and female employees\". It is this change in language which alerts us, argued Canada Post, to the fact that this particular section addresses systemic discrimination, for it indicates Parliament's concern about whether there is systemic discrimination, whether there is a pattern within the overall establishment of setting differences in wages between men and women performing work of equal value.\n[191] Canada Post underlined in its submissions that it accepts that section 11 addresses systemic discrimination, but argued that this acceptance does not mean that it accepts that complaints of systemic discrimination can only be brought by groups. Indeed, it submitted that individual complaints can be made based on allegations of systemic discrimination\n[192] As counsel for Canada Post submitted:\n...if it's systemic discrimination, and if it's men and women employed in the establishment, you take the wages of the women employed in the establishment and you take the wages of the men employed in the establishment, and you compare the work of men and women performing work of equal value and their wages. If there is a pattern of wage differences, then there is a violation.71\n[193] This comparison cannot, according to Canada Post, be equated with the evaluation process which is either mandated or is commonly followed when one is dealing with \"pay equity\" issues. That process most often involves the comparison of the value of work of groups of persons who are doing either \"women's work\" or \"men's work\".\n[194] The Commission's submission was that there is binding precedent from Evans, J., then of the Federal Court (Trial Division), in the Treasury Board case72, that the Commission's interpretation that section 11 does address the issue of \"pay equity\", as evidenced by the promulgation of the 1986 Guidelines, is correct. In answer, Canada Post argued that the acceptance by Evans, J. of the Commission's interpretation (and the use of the 1986 Guidelines) was based on the fact that all parties involved in that case accepted that interpretation. As there was no challenge to the Commission's interpretation of section 11, the presumption that the Guidelines were valid was never challenged. Canada Post noted that any comment made by Evans, J. must be accepted by this Tribunal as merely that - comment which can be useful to the Tribunal as it crafts its decision concerning the issue, but not binding on the Tribunal as precedent.\n[195] Additionally, Evans, J. made extensive comment on the viability of Guideline 14, which addresses occupational groups, in the context of section 11 of the Act. The interpretation of that particular guideline was the main issue to be decided by the tribunal which heard the Treasury Board case and by the Federal Court which reviewed its decision. The comments of Hugessen, J. in the Department of National Defence case73 were alluded to by Evans, J. and, therefore, should be, according to the Commission arguments, of import to this Tribunal's interpretation of section 11 of the Act.\n[196] The Commission submitted that the Supreme Court of Canada, in its June 2003 decision in Bell Canada, found that the Commission has the power, conferred upon it by section 27 of the Act, to create guidelines which are analogous to Regulations. That decision, argued the Commission, has created the presumption that the Guidelines are valid.\n[197] As is a challenge to promulgated Regulations, a challenge to the validity of the Guidelines is difficult. Courts prefer to accept that the subordinate legislation can be reconciled with its enabling legislation. If it were to accept Canada Post's interpretation, the Commission argued, the Tribunal would have to find that there is an operational conflict between the Act and the Guidelines, and that there is no ability to reconcile the conflict.\n[198] The Commission argued that Canada Post's choice to begin its \"ordinary meaning\" argument with the words \"male and female employees\" avoids the true meaning of section 11. The Commission based its submissions on the historical evolution of the concept of \"equal pay for work of equal value\", as well as comments made by the Courts. After so doing, it submitted that the Tribunal should accept the Commission's interpretation of section 11 of the Act as Parliament's enunciation of the principle of \"pay equity\". The Commission further submitted that Parliament addressed the difficulty of dealing with the abstract concept of \"pay equity\" by giving the Commission the tools to make that principle operational. Those tools include the Commission's ability to promulgate guidelines, pursuant to section 27 of the Act.\n[199] Therefore, the Commission promulgated its guidelines to accord with the purpose of \"pay equity\" legislation. The Commission submitted that the purpose of such legislation is to ameliorate the occupational segregation of women and the discriminatory payment of lesser wages to those segregated groups for work which is equal in value to work done by groups mainly composed of men. The main focus of section 11 of the Act, according to the Commission, should be the work which is being done, and its value, not the gender of the incumbents who are doing the work.\n[200] Based on this broad and liberal interpretation, argued the Commission, sections 12 through 15 of the 1986 Guidelines represent the methodology which must be used to make the principle enunciated in section 11 of the Act a workable theory. Those sections of the Guidelines are absolutely connected to section 11 of the Act, and make the two areas of the legislation work in tandem, to create a cohesive whole which is the basis for the evaluation work which must be completed to establish whether a complaint can be substantiated.\n[201] The Commission argued that, notwithstanding Canada Post's adamant submissions that its interpretation of section 11 of the Act is broad and purposive, and is actually more liberal in its ability to encompass any complainant(s), the reality and the natural conclusions which the Canada Post interpretation would create are narrow and restrictive. Its interpretation does not address the broad concept of \"pay equity\" which is what the legislation was intended to address from its beginnings.\n[202] According to the Commission's submissions, Canada Post's interpretation would restrict the evaluation process to a singular methodology. Only the job-to-job approach could be used. Only an examination of the whole \"system\" could be made in the evaluation process, even if the complainant were a single individual. Although there was a concession by Canada Post that representative sampling could be done at the evaluation stage, the Commission argued that Canada Post's interpretation of section 11 of the Act would create a cumbersome methodology which would, in fact, be regressive in nature.\nb) Tribunal's Analysis [203] All parties have quoted from Sullivan's Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, in its many iterations. The Tribunal agrees that this work is seminal when one is dealing with statute interpretation. Of note are the commentaries on what Driedger styled \"the modern rule\" of interpretation, as follows:\nToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.74\nThere is only one rule in modern interpretation, namely, courts are obliged to determine the meaning of the legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids. In other words, the courts must consider and take into account all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning. After taking these into account, the court will then adopt an interpretation that is appropriate. An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its compliance with the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion of the legislative purpose; and (c) its acceptability, that is, the outcome is reasonable and just.75\n[204] Additionally, the Interpretation Act must be considered. It indicates that:\nEvery enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.76\n[205] Based on these interpretive principles, the Tribunal finds that the Commission's submissions concerning the interpretation of section 11 of the Act represent the more appropriate approach to this section. The Tribunal has read the section within the context of the Act. Additionally, it has considered the interpretations of section 11 which have been presented by tribunals and Courts in the past. The Tribunal has before it expert evidence which addressed the historical evolution of the concept of \"pay equity\". This evidence, combined with comments made by Member of Parliament, the Honourable Ron Basford, during the discussions preceding the promulgation of the Act, reinforces, in the Tribunal's view, the finding that section 11 of the Act is intended to address the issue of \"pay equity\".\n[206] The Tribunal accepts that this interpretation is compatible with the purpose of the legislation, its context, and its legislative history. The purpose of the Act is set out in section 2, as follows:\nThe purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[207] Canada Post's submission that this purpose underlines the Act's scope as legislation which targets discrimination solely against individuals on specific grounds cannot be accepted. It is the Tribunal's view that this is a restrictive interpretation of legislation which is clearly meant to address the broad issue of discrimination against all persons. Acts of Parliament must be interpreted using large and liberal construction which will result in fairness to all. The elimination of groups made up of both male and female persons from the protection of the Act would result in a narrowing of the purpose of the Act. The Tribunal rejects this interpretation, and accepts that section 11 of the Act, in addressing discrimination in the area of \"pay equity\", conforms with the general purpose of the Act.\n[208] One of Canada Post's submissions was based upon what it characterized as an historical continuum of legislation. This continuum included other work-related legislation which has addressed the very real problem of a difference in wages paid to female and male workers, such as the Canada Labour Code. As noted already, successive governments have attempted, from the turn of the nineteenth\/twentieth centuries, to deal with the problem of differences in wages paid to male and female workers. From Canada Post's perspective, the passage of section 11 in the Act represents stage 4 in a continuum which began with minimum wage legislation, and moved on to \"equal pay for the same work\" done by males and females, slightly modified to become \"equal pay for substantially similar work\" and, according to their argument, would naturally evolve to become \"equal pay for work of equal value\" done by male and female workers. Eventually, in Canada Post's submission, \"pay equity\", a concept further along on the continuum, and somewhat distant from the first four concepts in its methodology and its focus, might become an issue to be addressed as stage 5. Its main argument, however, was that the concept of \"pay equity\" is not currently a part of the Act.\n[209] Canada Post conceded that the focus on occupational groups, deemed predominantly female or predominantly male, which can be compared using various methodologies involving such statistical means as regression analysis, is a legitimate characteristic of a \"pay equity\" study. Its submission was, however, that section 11 of the Act is not about \"pay equity\".\n[210] \"Pay equity\" legislation is, according to Canada Post, something entirely dissimilar from a denunciation of a difference in wages between men and women for work of equal value. While Canada Post agrees that \"pay equity\" has its focus on the problem of the occupational segregation of women, and the related problem of the undervaluation of women's work, it believes this interpretation represents a leap in conceptual thinking from what it argues are the clear words of section 11. As such, Canada Post implies that \"pay equity\" cannot be what Parliament meant to address when it created section 11 of the Act.\n[211] The Tribunal rejects this argument that \"pay equity\", as a concept, is beyond the scope of the Act. The concept has already been accepted as the interpretive basis for section 11 of the Act. In one of the first cases to discuss section 11, Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Department of National Defence), the Federal Court of Appeal noted that:\n[t]he case concerns pay equity...the appellant, as bargaining agent for the employees concerned, alleged that the respondent employer was not paying certain female employees wages equal to those paid to certain male employees performing work of equal value ... in contravention of Sections 7 and 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.77\n[212] Thus, from the very introduction to the judgement in that case, Hugessen, J. characterized section 11 of the Act as a section which had been created, specifically, to address the problem of \"pay equity\".\n[213] He quoted at length from Dickson, C.J. who \"[i]n the seminal case of Action Travail des Femmes v. Canadian National Railway Co.\" spoke for the Supreme Court of Canada.78 In that case, Dickson, C.J. quoted the Abella Report, to conclude that:\n...systemic discrimination in an employment context is discrimination that results from the simple operation of established procedures of recruitment, hiring and promotion, none of which is necessarily designed to promote discrimination. The discrimination is then reinforced by the very exclusion of the disadvantaged group because the exclusion fosters the belief, both within and outside the group, that the exclusion is the result of `natural' forces, for example, that women `just can't do the job' ... It is compounded by the attitudes of managers and co-workers who accept stereotyped visions of the skills and `proper role' of the affected group, visions which lead to the firmly held conviction that members of that group are incapable of doing a particular job, even when that conclusion is objectively false.79 (emphasis added)\n[214] Hugessen, J. then quoted from the Human Rights Tribunal decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Treasury Board which described systemic discrimination as\n[emphasizing] the most subtle forms of discrimination ... [and recognizing] that long-standing social and cultural mores carry within them value assumptions that contribute to discrimination in ways that are substantially or entirely hidden and unconscious. Thus, the historical experience which has tended to undervalue the work of women may be perpetuated through assumptions that certain types of work historically performed by women are inherently less valuable than certain types of work historically performed by men.80\n[215] Clearly, the language of the Treasury Board tribunal is the language of \"pay equity\".\n[216] From this position, Hugessen, J. indicated at paragraph 15 that \"[I]t is arguable, indeed, that the type of discrimination which pay equity is designed to counteract is always systemic\". He went on to quote from Nan Weiner and Morley Gunderson, Pay Equity Issues: Options and Experiences (Toronto: Butterworths, 1990) as follows\n...pay equity is designed to address a kind of systemic discrimination. Systemic discrimination is found in employment systems. It is the unintended byproduct of seemingly neutral policies and practices. However, these policies and practices may well result in an adverse or disparate impact on one group vis-a-vis another (e.g., on women versus men) ... Pay equity requires changes to pay systems to ensure that women's jobs are not undervalued. (emphasis added)\n[217] Again, Hugessen, J. underlined his decision that section 11 of the Act is dealing with the concept of \"pay equity\". He clearly indicated, by quoting from Weiner and Gunderson, that this concept deals with women's jobs which, historically, have been undervalued and must be addressed to change that systemic discrimination. It is the jobs which are of primary importance, not the gender of the incumbents.\n[218] This point, that the basis for equal value legislation in Canada was the perceived need to address occupational segregation and the undervaluing of women's work, was emphasized to the Tribunal in this Complaint by Professor Pat Armstrong who was accepted as an expert in women's work, women's wages, and the sociological aspects of equal pay legislation. She stressed that, historically in Canada, there has been a segregation of jobs into female and male dominated areas.\n[219] Dr. Armstrong noted that one of the federal government's responses to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women (1970) was the promulgation of the Canadian Human Rights Act, 1978, including section 11 of the Act to address systemic discrimination in wages, due to job segregation. This historical background, therefore, must be taken into consideration when interpreting section 11 of the Act. The purpose of the section must include the need to address the undervaluation of women's work, as seen in the segregation of that work into occupational groups dominated by women.\n[220] Section 11 of the Act, she indicated, is about \"pay equity\" and, as such, must deal with male and female-dominated job classes in order to address the occupational segregation which that concept targets. In addition to addressing jobs and gender, \"pay equity\" must discuss these issues through the prism of occupational segregation.\n[221] This expert evidence echoes the statement of the Honourable Ron Basford, Minister of Justice during Parliamentary debates in 1977 which preceded passage of the Act. As noted in paragraphs [53] and [54] of this Decision, the Honourable Ron Basford anticipated problems with the concept of equal pay for work of equal value as presented in section 11 of the Act. He noted, however, that the government's approach was to legislate the principle, and give to the Commission the task of solving any problems involved in the implementation of that principle. He went on to indicate that the underlying problem was occupational segregation of women, and their historical lower wages, caused by an undervaluation of women's work.\n[222] Given this background, as well as expert evidence, the Tribunal accepts that section 11 of the Act addresses the concept of \"pay equity\" which translates into \"equal pay for work of equal value\" between male and female workers.\n[223] The principle of \"pay equity\" between men's work and women's work which has equal value demands a methodology which has evolved as the concept has evolved. The methodology to be used to address the concept is not part of section 11. As the Supreme Court underlined in its June 2003 decision, the task of fleshing out the operation of section 11 of the Act has been given to the Commission. The promulgation of the 1986 Guidelines is the direct result of the task mandated to that body.\n[224] Each section of the Guidelines which Canada Post has challenged, based on its interpretation of the Act, addresses the concept of \"pay equity\". Indeed, Canada Post conceded in its submissions concerning the interpretation of section 11 of the Act that the Guidelines would be coherent and logical if one were dealing with \"pay equity\" in section 11. Their position was that section 11 does not make the conceptual leap to \"pay equity\" but rather must be interpreted using a straight-forward \"simple meaning\" approach.\n[225] The Tribunal finds that \"pay equity\" is the concept which section 11 was created to address. The words of the text allow for the plausibility of this interpretation, as commentators have used the terms \"equal pay for work of equal value\", \"comparable worth\", and \"pay equity\" almost interchangeably. This interpretation of section 11 is efficacious, as it promotes the legislative purpose as enunciated by the Minister of Justice immediately prior to the promulgation of the Act, as well as the intended purpose of the Act, section 2, read in a broad and liberal manner. Given the finding that this interpretation is plausible and efficacious, it is accepted as a reasonable and just interpretation which addresses the purpose of the Act both specifically in the section itself, and within the context of the whole philosophy of the Act.\n[226] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that \"pay equity\" has been accepted as the interpretative basis for section 11 of the Act, which addresses the undervaluation of work performed by women in occupational groups dominated by women. Examination of male and female job classes, therefore, becomes an important aspect of any \"pay equity\" study and the Commission's 1986 Guidelines, particularly those sections challenged by Canada Post, provide assistance in making that possible.\n[227] The test to be applied by the Tribunal in determining the validity of the particular sections of the Guidelines impugned by Canada Post is whether or not they are consistent with the meaning of section 11 of the Act. Canada Post has argued that they are inconsistent with section 11.\n[228] The Tribunal reiterates that a proper interpretation of section 11 recognizes that the section was created to address the concept of \"pay equity\", as described above. The Commission was entrusted, pursuant to the Act, to implement the concept and was required to make it operational by means of promulgating certain guidelines.\n[229] The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that the impugned sections 11 through 15 of the 1986 Guidelines, in providing guidance to interpret the \"pay equity\"-based section 11 of the Act, are vital to that interpretation. They also provide a cohesion and a wholeness to the legislation and are consistent with the meaning of section 11 of the Act and are, accordingly, valid and operable.\n[230] Additionally, subsection 8(2) of the 1986 Guidelines addresses specifically the methodology to be used when dealing with a particular aspect of the working conditions factor set forth in subsection 11(2) of the Act. As such, it, too, is necessary to the fleshing out of the principles of the Act, and is consistent with the meaning of section 11.\n[231] In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal has addressed the submissions of both Canada Post and the Commission concerning how best to test for the validity of the subordinate legislation. In effect, the Tribunal has endorsed the approach that one first interprets the enabling legislation, and then, based on that interpretation, determines whether the impugned subordinate legislation is consistent with its enabling statute.\n[232] Finally, the Tribunal considers it relevant to refer to Mr. Justice Evans' decision in the Treasury Board case, in which he indicated the following concerning the validity of an impugned guideline:\nIn view of the breadth of the statutory language of subsection 27(2), and of the attributes of the body to which the discretion has been conferred, a provision in any guidelines issues will only be held to be invalid if it is clearly incompatible with the terms of the grant of statutory power, when construed in light of the purposes of the Act...81\n[233] Using the language of Mr. Justice Evans, the Tribunal finds that subsection 8(2) and sections 11 through 15 of the 1986 Guidelines, challenged by Canada Post, are not incompatible with their enabling legislation when construed in light of the purposes of the Act. Indeed, the impugned Guidelines are necessary to the smooth operation of the Act and are found to be valid.\nC. Proof by Presumption [234] The question to be addressed is whether or not the proof by presumption referred to by Evans, J. in the Treasury Board decision, is a rebuttable presumption. All parties in this Complaint have agreed that a presumption, by its very nature of being a presumption, can be rebutted. The real question is what constitutes an acceptable rebuttal under the circumstances of this Complaint? Can this presumption, for example, be rebutted by \"reasonable factors\" other than those identified in the Guidelines?\n[235] Evans, J. noted that wage differences between men and women performing work of equal value that are attributable to prescribed \"reasonable factors\" other than sex, are exempt from the reach of section 11 of the Act. He stated that:\nAccordingly, once a complainant has established a difference in the wages paid to male and female employees performing work of equal value, a breach of section 11 is thereby established, subject only to the employer's demonstrating that the difference is attributable to one of the `reasonable factors' prescribed in Section 16 of the Guidelines.82\n[236] Evans, J. concluded, at paragraph 152, that:\nSubsection 11(1) can thus be seen to have tackled the problem of proof by enacting a presumption that, when men and women are paid different wages for work of equal value that difference is based on sex, unless it can be attributed to a factor identified by the Commission in a guideline as constituting a reasonable justification for it.\n[237] In addition, Evans, J. stated that:\n...the nature of systemic discrimination often makes it difficult to prove that the disadvantaged position in the workplace of many members of particular groups is based on the attributes associated with the groups to which they belong. This is because, as Dickson, C.J. observed ... systemic discrimination `results from the simple operation of established procedures of recruitment, hiring and promotion, none of which is necessarily designed to promote discrimination'. Accordingly, an employer's wage policies and practices may be based on such deep-rooted social norms and assumptions about the value of the work performed by women that it would be extremely difficult to establish in a forensic setting that, if women were paid less than men performing work of equal value, that difference was based on sex.83\n[238] The Commission and the Alliance argued in their submissions that the only way to rebut the aforementioned proof by presumption is to rely on a \"reasonable factor\" identified in the Guidelines.\n[239] Canada Post argued that, while relying on a \"reasonable factor\" in the Guidelines is certainly one way to rebut the presumption, that option is not the only one.\n[240] Canada Post elaborated that it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to allow only the Commission to displace the presumption of subsection 11(1) by means of its specified \"reasonable factors\". It argued that the purpose of the Act is to address discrimination on various grounds and section 11 does not include all of the grounds. It concerns discrimination based only on sex.\n[241] Accordingly, Canada Post added, the respondent or employer should be able to lead evidence to show that the reason for a wage difference, while not being a \"reasonable factor\", may be due to some cause other than sex. In other words, the list of \"reasonable factors\" cannot be close-ended but rather must be open-ended, thus providing an additional line of defence to rebut the presumption.\n[242] While the evidence must be persuasive and the burden of proof lies clearly with the respondent or employer, in Canada Post's view, it should have the opportunity to rebut the presumption by leading such evidence.\n[243] Essentially, Canada Post argued that if the employer or respondent put evidence before the Tribunal which showed, on a balance of probabilities, that the wage gap was not the result of sex discrimination, then that would constitute a rebuttal of the presumption. It is Canada Post's position that Evans, J. has not foreclosed this argument.\n[244] The Commission argued that Evans, J. was very clear about what constitutes a rebuttable presumption under subsection 11(1), namely, that only evidence of the presence of \"reasonable factors\" described in section 16 of the 1986 Guidelines can rebut the presumption that, once a difference in wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value is established, on a balance of probabilities, discrimination based on the ground of sex is also established.\n[245] Moreover, the Commission cited paragraph 48 of the Supreme Court of Canada decision, dated June 26, 2003, in Bell Canada (Supra note 39). This citation refers to the role of the Commission when it issues guidelines specifically dealing with the \"reasonable factors\" noted in subsections 11(4) and 27(2) of the Act to justify gender wage differences, as follows:\nThis provision clearly contemplates guidelines adding precision to the Act, without in any way trumping or overriding the Act itself.\n[246] In the Commission's submission, an open-ended list of \"reasonable factors\" would not serve the purpose of adding precision to the Act. Nor would it serve the principle of narrowly construing defences in human rights cases generally.\n[247] Finally, it is helpful to consider the testimony of expert witness for the Commission, Professor Pat Armstrong, concerning systemic discrimination as a concept. The witness was responding to a question from Canada Post's counsel, in cross-examination, relating to the Province of Ontario's human rights legislation:\nSystemic discrimination is presumed ... systemic discrimination refers to discrimination that arises from a variety of factors, not a single factor, like a single employer behaving inappropriately. Equal pay for work of equal value is based on a certain kind of discrimination. That is what is recognized as systemic discrimination, which is why guilt is not the issue, or, as Morley Gunderson says in his work for the Abella Commission, why it is not a question of even looking for root causes. It is an issue of trying to make pay more equal between male - and female - dominated work. So, it is not a question of discrimination in the general sense, but in the specific sense of systemic discrimination.84\n[248] The Tribunal accepts that section 11 of the Act is addressing, primarily, a particular discriminatory practice commonly known as systemic discrimination. This type of discrimination has often arisen, historically, from recruiting and hiring policies and practices that have inherently, but not necessarily intentionally, resulted in female employees being paid less than male employees for work of comparable value. The concept of \"equal pay for work of equal value\" is, therefore, an attempt to address systemic discrimination by measuring the value of work performed by men and women.\n[249] The Tribunal notes that Evans, J. has ruled in his decision of October 19, 1999 in the Treasury Board case, that subsection 11(1) effectively enacts a presumption that:\n...when men and women are paid different wages for work of equal value that difference is based on sex, unless it can be attributed to a factor identified by the Commission in a guideline as constituting a reasonable justification for it.85\n[250] The Tribunal also notes that, while all parties have agreed that a presumption, by definition, is rebuttable, there is not unanimity on what constitutes an acceptable rebuttal under the circumstances of the Complaint.\n[251] Evans, J. clearly states that the presumption under subsection 11(1) can be rebutted by \"reasonable factors\" established by the Commission under subsections 11(4) and 27(2) of the Act. On the other hand, Canada Post has argued that rebuttal should not be limited to the \"reasonable factors\" included in the Guidelines, but should be \"open-ended\".\n[252] The Tribunal notes that the aforementioned Supreme Court of Canada decision supports the view that the legislative intent was to add precision to the Act in terms of the guideline-making power which, in the Tribunal's opinion, is compatible with taking a \"close-ended\" approach to the establishment of \"reasonable factors\". Moreover, a close-ended list of \"reasonable factors\" would, in the Tribunal's view, also be compatible with the principle of narrowly construing defences in human rights cases.\n[253] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the presumption enacted by subsection 11 (1) of the Act, while being a rebuttable presumption, is one that can be rebutted only by \"reasonable factors\" identified, from time to time, by the Commission, pursuant to subsections 11(4) and 27(2) of the Act.\nV. PRIMA FACIE CASE A. Background and Elements of a Prima Facie Case for a Complaint brought under Section 11 of the Act [254] Because of the systemic nature of the discrimination alleged in the Complaint before the Tribunal, the Complaint is addressed using the current Act, as amended in 1998. This is evident from the discussion of retroactivity and the validity of the 1986 Guidelines noted in Section IV, B of this Decision. Therefore, the Tribunal must look at each element of section 11, as it currently reads. Each element in section 11 of the Act must be substantiated, on a balance of probabilities, in order to substantiate the Complaint.\n[255] Section 11 proscribes sexual discrimination in the determination of wages. Subsection 11(1) provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees, employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value. Subsection 11(2) provides the criterion for assessing the value of the work being compared. The value assigned to the work must be based on the composite of the skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions involved in performing the work. Additionally, subsection 11(4) allows an exemption to employers from a finding of discrimination because of special circumstances which are described as \"reasonable factors\".\n[256] As noted in Section IV, C of this Decision, section 11 contains a built-in presumption of discrimination based upon sex, one of the prohibited discriminatory factors noted in the Act, when a difference in wages has been found to exist between male and female employees, employed in the same establishment, performing work of equal value. This presumption is subject to the constraint of \"reasonable factors\", presented in subsection 11(4) and expanded in definition by the Guidelines.\n[257] As noted in Section IV, B of this Decision, the 1986 Guidelines are necessary to any discussion of section 11 of the Act, as they illuminate the principle of \"pay equity\" which is the basis for the section. Therefore, when addressing section 11 in the context of the Complaint before this Tribunal, each of the following elements must be proven, on a balance of probabilities. The elements are taken from section 11 of the Act and from the guidance which is offered concerning the particularizing of the section through guidelines promulgated by the Commission pursuant to its mandate under section 27 of the Act.\n(1) The complainant occupational group is predominantly of one sex and the comparator occupational group is predominantly of the other sex. In this Complaint, that means the complainant CR's must be predominantly female and the comparator PO's must be predominantly male.\n(2) The female-dominated occupational group and the male-dominated occupational group being compared are composed of employees who are employed in the same establishment.\n(3) The value of the work being compared between the two occupational groups has been assessed reliably on the basis of the composite of the skill, effort, and responsibility required in the performance of the work, and the conditions under which the work is performed. The resulting assessment establishes that the work being compared is of equal value.\n(4) A comparison made of the wages being paid to the employees of the two occupational groups for work of equal value demonstrates that there is a difference in wages between the two, the predominantly female occupational group being paid a lesser wage than the predominantly male occupational group. This wage difference is commonly called a \"wage gap\".\nB. Does the Complainant group and the Comparator group represent, respectively, a predominantly female occupational group and a predominantly male occupational group, suitable for comparison of work, under the Act? [258] The history of the groups known as CR's and PO's begins when the Treasury Board classification system was created for federal government departments in the 1960's. That system is still generally maintained in the federal sphere to date. The Post Office Department within the federal government was the precursor to the Crown Corporation, Canada Post. When, by federal statute, the Crown Corporation, Canada Post, was established in 1981, the federal government classification standards and the wage scales attributed to the government classification levels were maintained for those government employees who became employees of Canada Post. This was accomplished pursuant to the transition rules in the statute which created Canada Post as a Crown Corporation.\n[259] This Complaint was presented to the Commission by the CR occupational group, employed by the newly-created Canada Post. The CR group identified itself in the Complaint as \"female-dominated\". The group was made up of workers who had been classified as \"Clerical and Regulatory\" when they were employed in the Post Office Department. This Treasury Board classification was used for all Clerical and Regulatory workers employed throughout the federal government. When the CR's in the Complaint became part of the Crown Corporation, Canada Post, their CR classification was maintained. There was, however, an undertaking between the Alliance, the union representing the CR's and certain other occupational groups, and Canada Post that negotiations to re-evaluate the CR and other positions would eventually take place. This undertaking was the basis for the work which Canada Post management and the Alliance engaged in when they attempted to create the \"System One\" evaluation scheme.\n[260] The complainant group chose, as its comparator for the Complaint, the \"male-dominated\" Postal Operations group, the PO's. The PO's had been, like the CR's, employees of the federal government when the Post Office was a government department and had retained their status as PO's when they became employees of the newly-created Crown Corporation. These employees, represented by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), had originally been members of a unique federal group called \"mail handlers\".\n[261] As noted in paragraphs [25] and [26], above, on January 24, 1992, the date of the Commission's Final Investigation Report of this Complaint, with its recommendation that the Complaint be referred to the Tribunal, there were 2,310 CR positions, separated into levels of CR-2 (260 positions), CR-3 (950 positions), CR-4 (950 positions), and CR-5 (150 positions). There were 43,099 PO positions, separated into PO-INT positions (with four levels), PO-EXT positions (with three levels) and PO-SUP positions (with 6 levels). Although the actual effective date of these numbers has not been identified in the Commission's Final Report, it is assumed they represent the populations of the two groups as of the date of the Final Report, or close to that date.\n[262] In the year the Complaint was filed, 1983, the number of CR positions was virtually the same (2,316) as in early 1992 although the number of PO positions was larger by almost 8,000 positions (50,912).\n[263] Section 11 of the Act addresses work and wages in the context of \"pay equity\". Historically, \"pay equity\" has attempted to address the gender-based segregation of work, and the wages which flow from this segregation. Traditionally, the wages paid for work generally performed by women have been less than those paid for work generally performed by men. Because section 11 does not provide a definition for what constitutes a predominantly gender-based occupational group, the Tribunal must seek clarification from sections 12 and 13 of the 1986 Guidelines. The Commission used its powers under section 27 of the Act to produce this practical guideline for group complaints. Sections 12 and 13 of the 1986 Guidelines permit a comparison between \"occupational groups\" as long as those groupings represent work being done predominantly by males and predominantly by females.\n[264] Section 13 of the 1986 Guidelines identifies several formulas for determining when an occupational group is considered to be predominantly of one sex. For example, an occupational group numbering more than 500 is deemed to be composed predominantly of one sex if at least 55% of its members are of that sex. In the Complaint before the Tribunal, each group, as a whole, was made up of more than 500 members both at the time the Complaint was filed, and at the time it was referred to the Tribunal.\n[265] The complainant group had indicated to the Commission, and expressed the belief in the wording of the Complaint itself, that it was a female-dominated group. The group chosen as a comparator was presented by the complainant as a male-dominated group. In 1983, over 80% of the CR group was comprised of female employees and just over 75% of the PO group was comprised of male employees.86 At the time of referral of the Complaint to the Tribunal in 1992, the CR group remained predominantly female, with a percentage factor of over 83% female, and the PO group (which was now made up of only the PO-INT and the PO-EXT subgroups, the PO-SUP subgroup having been removed by the Commission during its investigation) remained predominantly male, with a percentage factor of just above 71% male.87\n[266] The Alliance and the Commission argue that these percentages are sufficient to classify the complainant group as being comprised of employees predominantly of the female sex, and the comparator group as being comprised of employees predominantly of the male sex.\n[267] The submissions of both the Alliance and the Commission concerning the gender predominance of the two groups are based on their interpretation of the 1986 Guidelines. Additionally, they argue that the Guidelines are, unless found to be ultra vires (which is not the case in this Complaint), binding on the Tribunal, according to the Act.\n[268] According to the 1986 Guidelines, argue the Alliance and the Commission, when an occupational group exceeds 500 in number, only 55% of the persons in the group need be of one gender to deem that group to be doing work of persons of that gender. Therefore, in this Complaint, the groups are deemed to be doing either work generally performed by women (the CR's) or work generally performed by men (the PO's) based on the fact that they are groups larger than 500 in total, and the percentage of either female or male members of each group makes its work representative of either female or male work. The argument is that this is a simple arithmetical computation which, once made, is one factor in choosing a complainant and comparator. It is the factor, however, which satisfies the element of section 11 (clarified by the Guidelines) which demands that, when one is dealing with a group complaint, the complainant be a predominantly female group and the comparator, a predominantly male group.\n[269] Canada Post argues that the percentages are illusory. Its submission is that the Postal Operations group cannot be viewed as a melded group. The PO group is, and traditionally has been, according to Canada Post, a group which aspires to the principle of \"straight-line\" wage rates. Canada Post's argument stresses that, during the history of the Complaint, the PO-4 level has always been the largest single element of the subgroup, PO-INT. It is the PO-4 level which is, according to Canada Post, most representative of the PO occupational group as a whole, and the classification category where the most PO jobs are found. Indeed, Canada Post argues that the PO-4 level of the Postal Operations group has never been anything but essentially neutral in its gender make-up and should be more properly regarded as representative of the entire PO group. In 1983, 53% of employees classified at the PO-4 level were male and 47%, female. In 1992, the figures were 50.6% male and 49.4% female. If the Postal Operations group were defined in the manner of the PO-4 level, Canada Post submits that, as the comparator, it would not fit within the definition of a \"predominantly male\" comparator group pursuant to the Guidelines.\n[270] Canada Post's argument is that to take the Postal Operations group as a whole is to ignore the historical trend by which the number of PO-4 level employees is becoming increasingly the most critical and representative category of Postal Operations workers. In fact, employees classified at the PO-4 level within the Internal Mail Processing and Complementary Postal Service Subgroup represented just over 83% of its Subgroup total in 1983, and 88% in 1992. On the other hand, as a percentage of the entire Postal Operations group, PO-4 level employees represented 41% in 1983 and almost 42% in 1992.\n[271] The Tribunal does not accept this argument. The federal government job classification scheme is predicated upon the concept of groups of employees, bound together by occupational job categories. Within these groupings, the concept of levels is connected to wage differentials. Historically, these levels, with their wage differentials, were based on factors such as seniority, management's view of the importance of the work performed at each level, and the requisite training and skills necessary. That a union at Canada Post, representing many or all of the Postal Operations group may have decided to attempt to create a situation where the classification levels are essentially unrelated to wage differentials cannot change the historical concept that is the basis for the groups and levels themselves. It is this concept that is important to the designation of \"occupational group\" in sections 12 and 13 of the 1986 Guidelines, and to the issue of \"pay equity\" in section 11 of the Act.\n[272] Therefore, the Tribunal accepts that the complainant occupational group, the CR's, and the comparator group, the PO's, are representative, respectively, of a female-dominated group and a male-dominated group because each is over 500 in number, and because each contains at least 55% of female employees (the complainant CR's) and male employees (the comparator PO's). This conclusion is based upon the 1986 Guidelines which indicate the importance of the size of each group, and the necessary percentage of either males or females in each occupational group of a specified size which will deem the group to be either male-dominant or female-dominant.\n[273] The Tribunal is bound by the Act to follow the Guidelines which address the specifics of the Complaint before it, a \"pay equity\" complaint under section 11 of the Act, dealing with occupational groups.\n[274] Canada Post submits that, even if the groups are gender appropriate, the Alliance's choice of the Postal Operations group as its comparator was made because of that group's position, at the time, as being highly paid. Such a choice, in the \"pay equity\" context, would, in Canada Post's submission, be \"cherry picking\" and, therefore, not appropriate.\n[275] Mr. Norman Willis, a witness for Canada Post who was accepted by the Tribunal as an expert in pay equity and in job evaluation, was one of a number of witnesses who explained the concept of \"cherry picking\".\n[276] He explained that, in a \"pay equity\" group complaint, the complainant group chooses its comparator group. \"Cherry picking\" in \"pay equity\" situations envisions a scenario where the complainant group chooses a comparator group which, while often small in members, represents the most highly paid of a number of available comparator groups. Although wages, understandably, is one natural aspect of the choice, as the \"pay equity\" complaint always involves an allegation of payment of less wages to the complainant when compared with the chosen comparator, choosing a group based solely on its characteristic of having high wages compared with the complainant group is not acceptable as a starting point for a legitimate \"pay equity\" comparison. It would skew the results of evaluation and comparison, in favour of the complainant. Allowing a \"cherry picked\" comparator would create upheaval within an establishment, as subsequent comparisons would be inevitable between the original complainant and other workers.\n[277] During his explanation of \"cherry picking\", Mr. Willis expressed the opinion that the Complaint before the Tribunal was tainted from the beginning because of the complainant's \"cherry picking\" of the comparator, based on the relatively high wages paid to employees in the Postal Operations occupational group. When confronted with the fact that the membership of the PO group was by no means a small group, but rather represented approximately 80% of all Canada Post employees, he agreed that this choice would have been a \"very big cherry\".88\n[278] On behalf of the Commission, Mr. Paul Durber, Director of the Pay Equity Directorate at the Commission, and accepted by the Tribunal as an expert in pay equity, indicated in his evidence that the Postal Operations group, as a whole, was approved by the Commission as a suitable comparator group, as it was part of the employer's occupational groupings. At the beginning of the Commission investigation, the PO group also appeared to offer a certain ease of evaluation and comparison because of the general homogeneous nature of the various jobs in each of the PO-INT and PO-EXT subgroups.\n[279] According to the evidence of Mr. Chris Jones, the union representative for the complainant group, one reason the comparator group was chosen was because of similarities in the duties and responsibilities of certain CR and PO jobs. A most obvious example was a CR job entitled `customer service clerk' and a PO job entitled `wicket clerk'. Although each job appeared to call for almost identical work, at the time of the Complaint each was paid differently. The superior wage of the wicket clerk and other PO jobs\/positions made the apparently predominantly male Postal Operations group an obvious choice as comparator for the complainant. Additionally, the PO group represented, in absolute numbers, the majority of postal employees.\n[280] Mr. Jones indicated that although the PO wages were thought to be generally higher than those of the CR's, the sheer size of the Postal Operations group was significant as a reason for its choice. As the largest group of Canada Post employees, representing by far the majority of the employer's total number of employees, the PO's were a natural choice of comparator for the CR's. The fact, too, that some of the work being performed by employees in both the complainant and comparator groups was similar in terms of skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions underlined, for the complainant, the appropriateness of its choice of comparator.\n[281] The Tribunal accepts that the largest occupational group within the organization, a group representing about 80% of the total Canada Post employee population, was an appropriate group to choose as a comparator. It appeared to be a predominantly male occupational group according to the Guidelines. The additional knowledge that certain members of the PO group were performing work which, in some instances at least, was similar to the work being performed by the complainant group added to the appropriateness of the choice.\n[282] Additionally, the evidence indicates that there were few other comparators which could have been chosen. At the time of the issuance of the Complaint, the General Labour and Trades, and the General Services occupational groups - both apparently male-dominated, according to the Guidelines - represented a small percentage of Canada Post employees. Moreover, there is no evidence that the work being performed by members of these groups was observed to be similar to that of any members of the CR complainant group.\n[283] Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the complainant, a predominantly female occupational group, and the comparator, a predominantly male occupational group, are appropriately designated under section 11 of the Act and the 1986 Guidelines as representative groups for comparison of work generally performed by women and work generally performed by men. Therefore, the first element necessary to the establishment of a prima facie case under section 11 of the Act has been met.\nC. Are the Complainant and the Comparator groups employed in the same `establishment'? [284] Subsection 11(1) of the Act reads as follows:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value. (emphasis added)\n[285] Subsection 11(3) of the Act states:\nSeparate establishments established or maintained by an employer solely or principally for the purpose of establishing or maintaining differences in wages between male and female employees shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be the same establishment.\n[286] Section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines reads as follows:\nEmployees of an Establishment\nFor the purpose of section 11 of the Act, employees of an establishment include, notwithstanding any collective agreement applicable to any employees of the establishment, all employees of the employer subject to a common personnel and wage policy, whether or not such policy is administered centrally. (emphasis added)\n[287] The French language version of section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines reads as follows:\nEmploy\u00e9s d'un \u00e9tablissement\nPour l'application de l'article 11 de la Loi, les employ\u00e9s d'un \u00e9tablissement comprennent, ind\u00e9pendamment des conventions collectives, tous les employ\u00e9s au service de l'employeur qui sont vis\u00e9s par la m\u00eame politique en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires, que celle-ci soit ou non administr\u00e9e par un service central. (emphasis added)\n(i) Evolution of the Definition of Establishment [288] The Commission established the Task Force on Equal Pay in November 1977 \"to study the implications of administering section 11 of the Act\". Among other matters, the Task Force addressed the question of defining the word `establishment' as used in subsection 11(1).\n[289] The Task Force's report, entitled \"Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value\" and dated March 1978, recommended that `establishment' be defined along the following lines, and be included in a guideline:\n`Establishment' means all buildings, works or other places of business of an employer within the limits of the larger of a municipality, municipal district, metropolitan region, county or the national capital region. (Recommendation to be completed)89\n[290] The Task Force noted that this definition was incomplete and would require further consideration. In this connection, it observed that \"the introduction of the word `establishment' in section 11 was deemed to be an attempt to introduce the factor of regional differences in wage levels as a legitimate reason for differences in wages between employees\".90\n[291] Mr. Paul Durber testified that, in his opinion, the above-noted geographic definition of `establishment' probably did not find its way into the September 1978 Guidelines because the Task Force had highlighted some conflicting views on the issue. In addition, he mentioned the need for the Commission to gain more experience in implementing section 11 before enshrining the definition in the Guidelines.91 There was, therefore, no definition of `establishment' in the 1978 Guidelines.\n[292] In September 1984, the Commission issued the Interpretation Guide for section 11 of the Act, entitled \"Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value\".92 This Guide was intended to assist employers and employees to understand how the Commission would assess complaints by providing definitions of certain terms used in the Act and elaborating on the `reasonable factors' included in the 1978 Guidelines.\n[293] The 1984 Interpretation Guide defined `establishment' as follows:\nAn establishment refers to all buildings, works or other installations of an employer's business that are located within the limits of a municipality, a municipal district, a metropolitan area, a county or the national capital region, whichever is the largest, or such larger geographic limits that may be established by the employer or jointly by the employer and the union.\n[294] Mr. Durber testified that despite the 1984 Interpretation Guide's general support of the geographic definition of `establishment', the Commission did not apply it consistently as the Commission also frequently used an alternative definition based on functional lines, particularly for cases involving the Federal Government and national organizations which it considered to be single nation-wide `establishments'.\n[295] The Chief Commissioner, in a letter dated March 19, 1985, to about 60 public and private sector employers, including Canada Post, sought their views on a number of proposed definitions and guidelines, including the definition of `establishment'. The request was aimed at removing much of the uncertainty experienced by some employers in implementing their own \"pay equity\" programs.\n[296] The Chief Commissioner's letter indicated that it was proposed to define `establishment' more broadly and on a different basis than the one used in the Commission's Interpretation Guide. The proposal was that a functional definition would replace the Guide's geographic definition. Specifically, the Commission proposed that:\nEmployees of an employer shall be considered to be in the same establishment when they are subject to a common set of personnel and compensation policies, regulations and procedures; and when these policies, regulations and procedures are developed and controlled centrally even though their administration may be delegated to small units of organization.\n[297] Canada Post's Vice-President, Personnel, responded to the Chief Commissioner's letter on June 3, 1985, specifically addressing the proposed definition of `establishment' as follows:\nThe Commission's proposed definition of `establishment' is also a source of concern. While the Commission has clear authority under the provisions of Section 22 of the Canadian Human Rights Act to provide guidelines, it is our understanding that those guidelines must conform with the Act taken as a whole. To move from a geographically-based to a functionally-based determination of establishment, we suggest, would be inconsistent with the Act and at odds with other statutory and judicial interpretations of the expression which frequently speak in terms of location rather than function.\n[298] Consultations between the Commission and the various employers, including Canada Post, led to certain changes in the proposed definitions and guidelines. Ultimately, the 1978 Guidelines (as modified in 1982) were replaced by the November 1986 Guidelines which for the first time included a definition of `establishment' (section 10). This definition was functionally-based along the lines of the one identified in paragraph [296] above.\n[299] At the same time, a new `reasonable factor' was added to the then-existing list (section 16), recognizing that a difference in wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value in the same establishment is justified by \"regional rates of wages, where the wage scale that applies to the employees provides for different rates of wages for the same job depending on the defined geographic area of the workplace\".\n[300] Accordingly, the Commission had formally moved, by late 1986, to a functionally-based definition of `establishment' from its earlier, inconsistently applied, policy of employing a regionally-based definition. The reasons for the Commission's shift are best explained by Mr. Durber's following response:\nQ. Could you remind us of the rationale for shifting to the functional basis?\nA. Yes. My view is that it was to allow a broader, let us say, more liberal interpretation and application of section 11.93\n[301] The Commission indicated that during the Investigation Stage of this Complaint (1984-1991), the assumption that the complainant and comparator groups were in one `establishment' was uncontested. Canada Post did not raise the issue of the definition of establishment within the context of the Complaint during this period, although it was involved in discussions with the Commission on this very topic during the drafting of the 1986 Guidelines.\n[302] Mr. Durber testified that he recalled learning from the investigator of the Complaint \"sometime in 1991\" that Canada Post's lead contact had indicated that the Corporation was \"thinking about whether establishment might not be an issue\". Mr. Durber was unaware of any formal indication from Canada Post that the definition of `establishment' would be argued as part of the Respondent's challenge to the Complaint.94\n[303] After a lengthy cross-examination, including questions on the Commission's work to define `establishment', Mr. Durber was asked by Commission counsel if his original opinion concerning the meaning of `establishment' had changed. He replied that, in the context of this Complaint, he\n... continue[d] ... to see there being one establishment, a good deal of commonality at the level of management accountability and otherwise, bringing those groups into one establishment, as meant by section 10 of the Equal Wages Guidelines, and, thus permitting continued comparison of job value as between clerks and postal operations people.95\n[304] Both the Commission and the Alliance acknowledged that counsel for Canada Post did raise questions about the meaning of the term `establishment' in the context of section 11 of the Act and section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines during his opening remarks before this Tribunal, in February 1993, as follows:\nThe next issue is the one that we see as being of pivotal importance, and that is the question of establishment ... So, the legislation certainly contemplates different establishments within one employer. The big question, which has never been considered, and as far as we are aware, never been argued, is: What is an establishment?96\n[305] Canada Post's counsel subsequently addressed the matter of `establishment' specifically in the context of the Guidelines, noting that \"the 1978 Guidelines contain no definition of `establishment'. The 1986 Guidelines contain a definition of `establishment'\".97\n[306] He then stated what Canada Post's position would be, as follows:\nOur position will be that the other side must come up with a definition of `establishment' which includes the CR's and the PO-Internal, PO-External and PO-Sups in the same establishment, to the exclusion of other groups. If the definition of `establishment' excludes other workers who work in the operational area at Canada Post, how does it include the CR's?98\n(ii) The `Airlines Case' [307] All parties agree that this Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, dated March 18, 2004, which addressed the issue of the definition of `establishment' in the context of section 11 of the Act, and section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines. This decision reversed the decision of the tribunal and the Federal Court (Trial Division) in a \"pay equity\" complaint brought by flight attendants (predominantly female) at Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, who were represented by one union. They named, as their comparator groups, pilots and maintenance\/technical workers (predominantly male) who were represented by two other unions. A fundamental issue dealt with by the tribunal as a preliminary matter was whether the complainant and the comparators were employed in the same establishment.\n[308] The tribunal found that the complainant, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (Airline Division), failed to demonstrate \"any semblance of essential common wage and personnel policies across the bargaining units\"99 and concluded that the three employee groups were not in the same `establishment' for the purposes of a section 11 complaint. The Federal Court (Trial Division) upheld the decision of the tribunal.100\n[309] The Federal Court of Appeal unanimously reversed this finding, deciding that the functionally-based definition of `establishment' in section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines would, in most cases, place all employees of an employer in the same establishment even though some employees might be represented by different unions.101 The complainant and the chosen comparators in the `Airlines Case' were, accordingly, found by the Court to be in the same establishment for the purposes of section 11 of the Act.\n[310] The Federal Court of Appeal highlighted the importance of interpreting human rights legislation broadly, liberally and purposively in the context of the words and purpose of the statute concerned. The Court stressed the necessity to interpret the Act and the 1986 Guidelines in a purposive manner, always being aware of the quasi-constitutional nature of the Act, and its aim to eliminate discrimination. The Court noted that in complaints brought under section 11 of the Act, the \"broad purpose\" of the section - \"to preclude wage discrimination on account of gender\"102 and \"the more particular purpose ... the promotion of pay equity\"103 - must guide the interpretation of the words of the section and the Guidelines promulgated by the Commission.\n[311] The Court indicated that the test for the interpretation of the word `establishment' in the context of these purposes was whether there was \"evidence that the employer treats the employee groups as being part of a single, integrated business. If there is such evidence, the employees are in the same establishment\".104 Evans, J., in his concurring reasons, stated that \"...employees of the same employer will normally be subject to `a common personnel and wage policy' when they are employed in the same business entity\".105\n[312] In other words, the definition of `establishment', as noted in section 10 of the 1986 Guidelines, was accepted by the Court as necessitating evidence of common personnel and wage policies which would be general in nature. There would be no need to examine the minute details of different collective agreements negotiated by unions which represent the groups being compared. The Court agreed that \"the definition of establishment should not be based on the myriad of details found in collective agreements\".106\n[313] Mr. Justice Evans, in his concurring reasons, also indicated that \"[t]he terms of collective agreements that apply to complainants and other employees with whom they wish to be compared for pay equity purposes are irrelevant to determining whether the complainants and the comparators are employed in the same establishment within the meaning of section 11 of the ... Act ... and section 10 of the Equal Wages Guidelines...\"107\n(iii) Impact on the Current Case of the Federal Court of Appeal Decision in the `Airlines Case'\n[314] Although, as noted above, all parties to the Complaint before this Tribunal acknowledged that the Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the `Airlines Case', Canada Post argued, in its written submissions, that the decision was also important to the Tribunal because it underscored several of Canada Post's previous arguments.\n[315] Three of Canada Post's arguments deserve particular reference. The first related to the question of the essential objective of section 11 of the Act and the presumption of discrimination based upon sex, found in that section. The second dealt with an accurate and fair determination of the value of `wages' for the purposes of a section 11 inquiry. The third concerned the relevance of collective bargaining strength in a \"pay equity\" study.\n[316] As noted in paragraph [310], clear guidance on the question of the essential objective of section 11 has been provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in the `Airlines Case' decision. With respect to the issue of the presumption of discrimination, the Tribunal has already addressed this matter in Section IV, C of this Decision.\n[317] Canada Post's second argument relating to the definition of `wages' is considered in the context of Section VIII, entitled Non-Wage Forms of Compensation, which follows in this Decision.\n[318] Canada Post, in its third argument, has reasoned that the Federal Court of Appeal decision recognizes that bargaining strength is not only relevant to the `Airlines Case' but also constitutes an important part of any inquiry into sex-based wage discrimination.\n[319] The Tribunal finds that the Federal Court of Appeal decision confines its consideration of bargaining strength to\n...the factors which the Tribunal is to use in determining whether employees receive equal wages and perform work of equal value. To the degree that the evidence of differing bargaining strength is evidence pertaining to these factors, it is relevant and will be considered by the Tribunal at the substantive phase of the analysis.108 (emphasis added)\n[320] The factors are identified by the Federal Court of Appeal as being those set out in section 11 of the Act and in the Guidelines. They are, therefore, by definition, limited to the interpretation of section 11 and to the \"reasonable factors\" identified in section 16 of the 1986 Guidelines.\n[321] The Tribunal does not find that the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the `Airlines Case' sanctioned an `open-ended' approach to the \"reasonable factors\", allowing the admittance of additional factors such as bargaining strength to those already provided for in the Guidelines. The Federal Court of Appeal clearly indicates that to the degree that this evidence of differing bargaining strength is evidence pertaining to the factors set out in section 11 of the Act and in the Guidelines, that evidence will be considered at the substantive phase of a tribunal's analysis.\n[322] Has `bargaining strength' been presented in this Complaint as evidence pertaining to the factors listed in section 16 of the 1986 Guidelines as `reasonable factors' to justify an employer establishing or maintaining a difference in wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value in the same establishment? Canada Post has submitted that the differences in the collective bargaining philosophies of the complainant and comparator groups must be considered by the Tribunal. It has also argued that the historically gender-neutral, and numerically large, PO-4 sub-group, an active representative in the collective bargaining process for the PO group, must be considered because of its \"straight-line\" wages philosophy.\n[323] The Commission and the Alliance have submitted that union bargaining strength has never been designated as a \"reasonable factor\" in the Guidelines. Canada Post's arguments, therefore, should not be considered unless there is some evidence which links those arguments to the \"reasonable factors\". Very early in the hearing, counsel for the Commission addressed this very point, as follows:\nAnother point that is not disputed is the strength of unions or union bargaining strength or whatever. It's not in the Guidelines. It wasn't in the Guidelines in 1978, 1982, or 1986. It has never been in the Guidelines...109\n[324] The Tribunal is not aware of any bargaining strength evidence specifically pertaining to the factors set out in section 11 of the Act and in the Guidelines having been submitted, at any time, by the parties in this Complaint.\n[325] The original Complaint did not address directly the issue of `establishment'. The Complaint was drafted by the Complainant to indicate that the employer, Canada Post, had allegedly violated section 11 of the Act \"by paying employees in the male-dominated Postal Operations Group more than employees in the female-dominated Clerical and Regulatory Group for work of equal value\". Further, it was alleged that the sex composition of the two groups was the basis for the difference in wages, and, thus, the Complaint alleged discrimination based on sex.\n[326] Therefore, as noted by Mr. Durber in his evidence about the Commission's interpretation of `establishment' when it was dealing with complaints brought by groups working for the Federal Government and other large nation-wide corporations, it is apparent that the Complainant and the Commission assumed, from the inception of the Complaint, that `establishment' and `the employer' were synonymous.\n[327] For the reasons given by the Federal Court of Appeal in the `Airlines Case' decision, this assumption would appear to be the correct one. Although there will be times when an employer has more than one establishment within its purview, in most cases the employer and the term `establishment', in the context of the Act, will be one and the same when the employer treats its employee groups as being part of an integrated business entity with a commonality of personnel and wage policies.\n[328] In this Complaint, considerable evidence was presented, usually through Canada Post witnesses, that Canada Post operated as an integrated business entity with, generally, overall personnel and wage policies. Several examples of such evidence are considered below.\n[329] In May 1997, Elisabeth Kriegler, President and CEO of Elisabeth Kriegler and Associates, an organization of Change Management Consultants, appeared before this Tribunal. She had been called by Canada Post as a general witness. She had served at the Vice-Presidential level in several corporate functional areas in Canada Post during the period 1983 to 1992. She then occupied the office of Senior Vice-President - Administration from 1992 to 1995. From 1995 to early 1997, she was President of Canada Post Systems Management Ltd., a company which owned the intellectual property of a number of management systems and processes developed, over the years, by Canada Post and marketed, internationally, through licensing arrangements.\n[330] Ms. Kriegler emphasized that operating a postal system is probably one of the most complex logistics businesses in the world involving, in Canada Post's case, not only its own employees but also many thousands of others under contract. \"All of them are an intricate part of this integrated network, all of which must operate in concert and according to standards and in harmony...\"110\n[331] As pointed out in paragraph [33], in carrying out its objects, the new Crown Corporation created in October 1981 was to have regard to \"...the need to conduct its operations on a self-sustaining financial basis while providing a standard of service that will meet the needs of the people of Canada...\". Ms. Kriegler indicated that this called for the efficient and effective collection, processing and delivery of mail within a financially competitive framework which, in turn, necessitated the development and introduction of a comprehensive series of operational, financial, human resources, marketing and management systems.\n[332] Ms. Kriegler reported that the operations of Canada Post \"...are the heart and soul of this Corporation, how without it, it is not a Corporation, it is not a business...\".111 The establishment of the National Control Centre in Ottawa, in the mid-1980s, reflected the crucial need for a centralized operations control and monitoring system.\n[333] Members of Canada Post's senior management meet daily in the National Control Centre to review operational problems which are fed into headquarters from divisional control centres across the country. This encourages operating people to make decisions as and where problems arise. The operating network is supported by a series of systems that track and trace the movement of mail throughout Canada.\n[334] The Tribunal members had the opportunity to visit the National Control Centre and saw it in action with its inward and outward flow of information visually displayed, in colour, on screen, against the backdrop of a giant map of Canada.\n[335] The role and impact of Canada Post's operational functions including the National Control Centre are, perhaps, best summed up by Ms. Kriegler's following statements made before the Tribunal in May\/June 1997:\n...and in fact today, notwithstanding decentralization and empowerment ... the control of the operation is totally central today and must always remain so because the minute you let that loose, the network starts falling apart. So it is centrally controlled and that is the role of the Control Centre and that is why the President and the Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer and the Marketing Senior VP and the Operating Senior VP and all their senior people sit at that table every single morning. That is the central control.112\nAll the employees know that they are a component or a part of that larger integrated system.113\n[336] Certainly, the nature of the operations of Canada Post, and particularly the role of the National Control Centre, offer clear evidence of Canada Post functioning as a single integrated business and treating all of its employee groups as essential components of that entity.\n[337] Ms. Kriegler also demonstrated that this was not limited to the area of operations. The development of management functional areas of responsibility following the creation of Canada Post as a Crown Corporation went well beyond the critical area of operations. Ms. Kriegler reported that the various supporting management functions were gradually brought in from the different agencies of government and developed under the wing of Canada Post with its own staff.\n[338] Functions such as finance, personnel and staff relations, and labour relations were transferred shortly after Crown Corporation status. Purchasing, pay and benefits, property management and legal affairs were transferred at later dates. Canada Post staff had to be built up, and policies, standards and procedures had to be developed in each of the functional areas.\n[339] The 1980's also saw a growing emphasis on marketing and meeting the customers' needs. Retail outlets and franchising arrangements evolved. Even a Research and Development Centre emerged where new Canada Post products, services and equipment were conceived, developed and tested.\n[340] Organizationally, there was, according to Ms. Kriegler, an Executive Vice-President of Personnel and Labour Relations in 1983. By 1992, Ms. Kriegler, herself, assumed policy responsibility as Senior Vice-President - Administration, for human resources, labour relations, personnel, legal affairs, and several other functions.\n[341] Ms. Kriegler identified certain situations where a common corporate approach was taken by Canada Post in the personnel policy field or in areas closely related to personnel policy, or, as it is currently more frequently called, Human Resources policy. One was the creation of the Canada Post Learning Institute which established a common centralized training budget by drawing particular training program funds from individual operating units. A principal objective was to coordinate the development and use of training programs for employees from across the entire organization to derive a more effective return for both employees and the employer.\n[342] Another example was with respect to labour relations and collective bargaining strategies which, inevitably, touch on wage policy. Between bargaining sessions, Canada Post coordinated, at the senior management level, the development of goals and strategies it would like to achieve with its various unions. Ms. Kriegler, in her capacity as Senior Vice-President - Administration, would take such proposed goals and strategies to the Management Committee for consideration.\n[343] There was also evidence presented by other Canada Post witnesses who appeared before this Tribunal which indicated central corporate direction in areas involving Compensation and Benefits, labour relations, employee training and human resources policy. Examples are explored below.\n[344] Mr. Harry Phillips, Director - Safety, Ergonomics and Industrial Hygiene at Canada Post headquarters, testified in August 1997. He spoke about the Corporate Manual System which came into effect in 1989 for the purpose of providing appropriate corporate direction in consolidating all functional procedures. As examples, he mentioned procedures dealing with functional areas such as operations, engineering, human resources (personnel), and safety hazards.\n[345] Mr. Ron Featherstone testified in December 1998, as Manager of Collection and Delivery for the Northern Zone in Vancouver. He indicated that one of his responsibilities was to establish \"...long term objectives that complement the Corporation's Operating Principles and its Corporate Objectives...\". Under cross-examination by Commission counsel, Mr. Featherstone agreed that it is his understanding that corporate principles and corporate objectives are intended to guide all employees of the Corporation, and would apply to both CR and PO employees and their respective work.114\n[346] In April 1999, Ms. Joanne Hronowski, a Payroll Officer for the Prairie Region (who had, on occasion, served as Acting Manager - Pay and Benefits) testified that several manuals which had originally been issued by the Department of Supply and Services, guided Payroll and Benefits officers in their work. Updates to the manuals, communiqu\u00e9s and informative circulars about items such as particular kinds of benefits, were received from Head Office. \"...So most of the stuff was vetted at the Head Office level and then came through us\".115 She also testified that the then-current payroll system used in her region was a national one. \"It is driven totally by Head Office\".116\n[347] Mr. Charles Reece, a long-time employee of Canada Post and, most recently, Manager for the Revenue Verification Unit of the Gateway Bulk Mail Facility at Mississauga, Ontario, when testifying in April 1999, about his facility's capacity to train supervisors and staff, said as follows:\nAnd at times we even had people from Head Office come down. Usually when something new was being introduced and it was something that we didn't know anything about, they would come down and do formalized training with us.117\n[348] In May 1999, Mr. Frank Pasacreta, Vice-President of Operations for the B.C. Maritime Employers Association, testified before the Tribunal. He had held this position since 1987. Prior to that, he had been Manager of Labour Relations for Canada Post in Vancouver, responsible for the Pacific Region from 1984 to1987. Mr. Pasacreta was asked by Commission counsel if, during his tenure in the Pacific Region, he or his staff had been involved in collective bargaining negotiations for employees in his Region. His response was as follows:\n...primarily the people who did the bargaining were the folks at head office. Some of us sat in on some of the sessions. I sat in on a few myself, but the primary responsibility was a head office responsibility.118\n[349] Ms. Karin Vogt, Compensation and Benefits Officer, at the management level, from Burnaby, B.C., testified in September 1999 that Superannuation, Procedures and other manuals constitute an important source of information for those working in her area of responsibility. The use of computer-based record systems is also critical. She confirmed that manual up-dates and communiqu\u00e9s came from Head Office. She also indicated that training sessions were sometimes handled by headquarters. Specifically, she noted that \"...last year we had someone come out from head office and she went over the disability insurance plan\".119\n[350] Mr. Brian Wilson testified in May 1999. A long-time employee of Canada Post, he retired in 1995. His last position was Manager - Employee Relations, Central Region. During cross-examination by Commission counsel, Mr. Wilson confirmed that it was his understanding that a series of personnel policy directives existed in Canada Post, most of which would have been\nissued by the corporate Human Resources group in headquarters. These are applicable to all employees throughout the Corporation, and include the following:\nOfficial Languages Policy Employee Assistance Program (counselling and referral service) Sensitive Information Policy Religious Observance, Sick Leave and Pregnancy, Modified Duties, Sign Language Human Rights and Employment Equity, including Partnering with Women, Sexual Harassment, People with Disabilities, Visible Minorities\n[351] The Tribunal concludes that the above-noted evidence demonstrates that Canada Post, during the time frame of this Complaint, had become an increasingly well integrated business entity with considerable corporate level policy direction. The corporate policy direction extended to the various regional operations of Canada Post, encompassing its many employees across the country. Indeed, much of the evidence suggests a very good mutual working relationship between the regions and Head Office.\n[352] Human Resources (or personnel) policy direction clearly emanated from corporate headquarters and addressed all employees as members of the integrated business. Equally, labour relations, including collective bargaining negotiations which include wage policy considerations, received corporate direction, and even direct involvement, from Head Office.\n[353] Therefore, the Tribunal finds that all employees of Canada Post have been, as applicable, subject to the various common corporate policy directives issued by the Corporation, including those respecting personnel and wage policies. As a result, the Tribunal finds that, for the purposes of section 11 of the Act, the employee groups representing the complainant and the comparator are employed in the same establishment.\n[354] Accordingly, the second element necessary to the establishment of a prima facie case under section 11 of the Act has been met.\nD. Does the comparison of the work of the Complainant group and the Comparator group establish that the work being compared is equal in value? Are the jobs\/positions data and the process comparing the work of the Complainant and the Comparator groups reliable?\n(i) Background [355] All three parties have recognized the importance of undertaking job evaluations with reliable job information and with a reliable job evaluation plan. Additionally, the plan and the process chosen must be suitable for \"pay equity\" purposes. This is not in dispute. What has to be determined, however, is the extent of the reliability of the job information and of the methodology employed in the evaluation of the jobs\/positions involved in this particular Complaint. To be able to come to a reasonable conclusion concerning the value of the work performed by the complainant and the comparator occupational groups, the evaluation process as a whole must be reliable, on a balance of probabilities.\n[356] The Commission presented, as evidence, a booklet entitled \"Implementing Pay Equity in the Federal Jurisdiction\".120 Originally, this had been a paper written by staff within the `Pay Equity Directorate' of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It was published as a booklet by the Commission in March 1992. At the time of publication, the Commission had been involved in a number of \"pay equity\" complaints, one of them the Complaint before this Tribunal.\n[357] The introduction to the booklet states that it had been prepared in response to requests from employers and unions. It was meant to be advice about how \"to pursue effective pay equity programs\" under the Act and its accompanying Guidelines. The introduction states further that the points made in the booklet \"are based on the experience of Commission staff working in pay equity, as well as comments received from employees and unions on earlier drafts of this paper\".\n[358] While this booklet did not exist during the Investigation Stage (1984-1992) of this Complaint, much of the thinking expressed therein was evolving within the Commission during that period. It is, therefore, helpful to refer to it to provide background to the Commission's thoughts, by 1992, about job evaluation plans, their administration, and the collection of job data\/information. The following paragraphs are excerpts from various sections of the booklet which are considered pertinent.\nJob Evaluation Plans\nJob evaluation plans are the key to determining what constitutes \"work of equal value\". They do not eliminate subjectivity from the process of valuing work, but they do make the process systematic and so ensure that values are applied in a way that is consistent. Without such a systematic examination of job values, it is easy to perpetuate prevailing stereotypes about the worth of different occupations - stereotypes that generally work to the disadvantage of jobs done by women.\nJob evaluation plans may be developed especially for an organization or they may be based on a standard plan purchased from a consulting firm. These latter are \"off-the-shelf\" and have established criteria for evaluations, while others use computers to generate criteria based on data gathered within the organization. All plans eventually rely on a set of standard factors and weightings against which different jobs are rated.\nIn order to be an acceptable instrument for implementing pay equity, a plan must meet a number of tests:\nit must include the four value criteria set out in the Act and elaborated upon in the Guidelines: skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions; it must measure value in a way that allows ready comparison between jobs - usually this means adopting a point-factor rating system - other types of systems may be acceptable in certain circumstances, for example, paired comparisons in small organizations; and it must be free of gender bias: Gender bias refers to any factor or behaviour which, even unintentionally, unfairly favours one sex over the other. In the context of pay equity studies, gender bias can affect both the design of job evaluation plans and their application.\nBecause pay equity is premised on the assumption that the worth of different positions across an organization should be compared, use of a single plan to evaluate all jobs is essential.\nWith respect to the plans themselves:\nfactor definitions should be generic, relying as little as possible on illustrative job descriptions that could produce bias - this helps minimize raters' tendency to stereotype tasks or functions as male or female; the factors used must incorporate all significant elements of all the work being evaluated, including those aspects of female-dominated jobs traditionally overlooked in job evaluation; weightings given to factors typical of predominantly male work and predominantly female work should be equitable; and computerized plans should be programmed such that important elements of traditionally female work are not left out of the automated development of factors and weighting. Typically, this requires especially careful design of questionnaires to ensure that key information is not missed.\nWith respect to the administration of plans:\nwomen and men should have similar representation on all committees; participants should be drawn from all levels of the organization; and it must be made clear to participants that during the pay equity process, all are equal - those from the lower ranks of an organization should feel comfortable expressing their own views and challenging the opinions of others.\nCollection of Job Information\nWith respect to the collection of job information:\njob descriptions should not be used on their own or treated as the primary source of data, since they often replicate prevailing stereotypes and are not always an up-to-date, accurate reflection of work done; instead, sources of information which allow the incumbent himself or herself to outline work duties should be employed - in most cases, this involves use of a questionnaire; the questionnaire must be carefully designed and tested, possibly through a pilot study to ensure that it captures all significant aspects of male- and female-dominated jobs and is appropriate to the structure of the job evaluation plan; it must be made clear to all involved that the questionnaire should reflect actual work being done, not theoretical duties; supervisors should be given an opportunity to review completed questionnaires and add any comments or reservations on an attached sheet; and where questionnaires do not seem to offer sufficient information, they may be followed up with face-to-face, structured interviews between evaluators and incumbents.\nQuestionnaires can be open, closed or mixed, depending on the requirements of the plan, the preferences of those running the study, and the size of the organization. In smaller organizations, it may not be possible to carry out the testing needed to develop a reliable closed questionnaire. However, open questionnaires must be used with care. Efforts must be made to ensure that men and women use similar language to explain their work. Thus, when open questions are chosen, instructions should be included which encourage all those filling out the questionnaire to use accurate terms in describing their job functions. Examples showing how different sorts of duties could best be described may be appropriate.\nJoint Employer-Employee Cooperation\nAlthough the legal onus for ensuring pay equity is on the employer, the Commission believes that pay equity programs are most successful when based on full cooperation between employer and employees ... Both sides must contribute to the process. Employers provide the funding for studies and any necessary adjustments, as well as the informed perspective of managers on what different jobs entail. Employees provide the key job information and support for any changes to prevailing relativities that may result. Both employers and employees have input into the definition of job worth as reflected in the job evaluation plan and its application.\nJoint studies generally begin with an agreement between the employer and bargaining agent(s) which outlines the objectives of the initiative and its basic structure. A joint steering committee may be set up to choose an appropriate job evaluation plan, perform benchmark evaluations, establish evaluation committees, work out other details of the study and guide it through to a successful conclusion. Most of the actual evaluations are carried out by one or more evaluation committees, which, we suggest, should include a comparable number of women and men from all levels of the organization. Any wage adjustments found to be necessary as a result of the evaluations must be agreed to by both sides.\n[359] The Tribunal finds that the aforementioned points described in the Commission's booklet constitute a general guide and benchmark model for collecting reliable information and for processing that information in a manner that should, given an acceptable job evaluation plan and competent evaluators, result in the determination of reliable values of the work being assessed and compared in a \"pay equity\" study.\n[360] These points made by the Commission are the very points made by such experts as Dr. Pat Armstrong, accepted by the Tribunal as an expert in women's work, women's wages, and the sociology of equal pay legislation, who presented evidence to the Tribunal concerning, amongst other things, the history and development of the concept of \"pay equity\", and the methodologies used to implement that concept.\n[361] It should be noted, however, that the points made in the Commission's booklet are predicated upon the assumption that the \"pay equity\" process will be one which involves an employer and its employees in a working partnership. \"Pay equity\" will be the common goal of that partnership. The booklet, and its advice concerning \"pay equity\" studies, does not envision a process which is evolving in a litigious context.\n(ii) Issues [362] Consequently, the issues which will be addressed are as follows:\nWhat job evaluation system, or plan, was used to undertake the evaluation of the CR and PO jobs\/positions, and how reliable was it? What process was used and how reliable was it in analyzing the collected job data\/information for purposes of assigning values to the CR and PO jobs\/positions considered? What job data\/information was collected, and from what sources, and how reliable was it? What were the resulting values attributed to the various CR and PO jobs\/positions, and how reliable were they?\n[363] These issues can best be considered by distinguishing between two periods of time:\nFirst, the duration of the Investigation Stage of the Complaint - 1984 to 1992, when the Commission was coordinating the collection of job data and performing job evaluations, and\nSecond, the period after the establishment of the Tribunal in 1992, when the Alliance had engaged a three-person team of professional job evaluators to review the job data already collected by the Commission and augment it where possible, and to undertake independent evaluations of the jobs of the complainant and comparator occupational groups. The professional team was active in mid-1993 and late 1994, and re-visited their work in July 1997 and June 2000.\nE. Review of Job Information Collected and Methodology Used: Investigation Stage [364] A joint employer\/employee follow-up study of the Complaint before this Tribunal was not undertaken. There was, therefore, no opportunity to establish a joint steering committee to co-ordinate the selection of a job evaluation plan, the gathering of job data\/information, and the evaluation of jobs. Of necessity, the Commission took the lead, through its Investigation Stage, in coordinating matters relating to complaint follow-up with both the Complainant and the Respondent.\n[365] While a joint employer\/employee study would have been the most suitable way of addressing the Complaint, the Tribunal finds that the lack of such a study, for whatever reasons, need not pre-empt addressing the Complaint by other approaches. The Complaint was made pursuant to section 11 of the Act; the Commission's mandate is to investigate each complaint made to it under the Act. When the parties cannot be moved to a negotiated settlement, the Commission's job is to investigate a complaint to the best of its ability. For example, while the job evaluation plan used to determine the value of particular job work should, normally, be a plan already in use by the employer, in its absence an off-the-shelf evaluation plan would be acceptable if it is free of gender-bias and capable of generating a reliable result.\n(i) Commission's 1987 Job Evaluations [366] In this Complaint, as already noted in paragraph [17] the first job evaluations were conducted by Commission staff in 1987 based on data collected in 1986. Those evaluations involved what the Commission described as a random sample of 194 CR positions. The sampled CR positions were evaluated using Canada Post's System One job evaluation plan. No PO positions were evaluated in 1987.\n[367] System One was a plan that had been categorized as having \"Hay-like factors\". It did, however, contain some variations from the standard \"Hay Method\" evaluation plan, most especially with respect to the working conditions factor. As the Commission investigated the Complaint, System One was still under joint development by Canada Post and the Alliance. It was intended for use by employees represented by Alliance bargaining units throughout Canada Post. As Canada Post pointed out, System One would, therefore, not be suitable for the eventual evaluation of PO jobs, since their incumbents were represented by other bargaining units. Moreover, the Alliance advised against its use even for CR job evaluation purposes at this incomplete stage of development.\n[368] The principal sources of job information for the evaluation of the 194 CR positions in 1987 were successive lists of employee print-outs furnished by Canada Post and a Job Fact Sheet - a detailed Questionnaire - that had been designed by the Commission for completion by employees sampled from those lists. Upon its completion, with the requisite attachment of the relevant job description and organization chart by each employee respondent, the Job Fact Sheet was to be signed off by the appropriate supervisor and Division Manager. The questionnaire, or Job Fact Sheet, was assembled in the first half of 1986. During the summer of that year, it was completed by the CR employees who had been randomly chosen to be a representative sample of CR positions.\n[369] The Commission had decided that such a sampling of CR incumbents would be necessary since a full census of the total CR population of about 2,300 would be unmanageable in terms of time and money. A stratified random sample was developed in 1986 by a senior official of the Commission. It consisted, initially, of 246 names of CR incumbents plus 33 \"alternates\" for a total of 279. Subsequently, some names were dropped and others were added. The actual number involved is difficult to verify from the available documentation. The final proposed CR sample may have been as high as 355, including \"alternates\". What is clear, however, is that the Commission received 194 completed and useable Job Fact Sheets from CR incumbents which became the basis for the 1987 CR evaluation.\n[370] Meanwhile, an Interview Guide had been developed by the Commission with input from the Alliance and Canada Post. Its purpose was to guide the Commission's investigator during follow-up interviews which were to be conducted with the incumbents, to clarify answers given on the Job Fact Sheet. Space was provided on the form for the investigator to record comments made by the incumbent and the accompanying supervisor. The form was not seen by incumbents. It was intended that, like the Job Fact Sheet, the Interview Guide would be used with both CR and PO employees. In fact, however, both were used only to elicit information from the CRs. All interviews were completed by December 1986.\n[371] The Job Fact Sheet was used as the Commission's primary source of job information and the other materials served as secondary and tertiary sources.\nHow were the job evaluations of the sample of 194 CR positions actually conducted in 1987?\n[372] An `evaluation team' comprised of two Commission officers was established to conduct the evaluations. These evaluations were done from April to September 1987. The team was supplemented by one of three additional officers, assigned progressively based upon which officer had interviewed the CR incumbent of the position being evaluated. The team, of mixed gender, used the System One plan, drawing data from the 1986 Job Fact Sheets, job descriptions, organization charts, and the Interview Guides.\n[373] Mr. Paul Durber, Director - Pay Equity of the Commission, indicated in his evidence before this Tribunal in June 1993, that he and the senior investigator of the Complaint had decided, about mid-1991, to discard the 1987 CR evaluations and to subject the 1986 Job Fact Sheet information to another job evaluation assessment. Most of the Commission's officers who had served on the 1987 evaluation committee were no longer on staff, so a new group was struck. Hence, the 1987 CR evaluation results were not used in the Commission's final investigation process.\n(ii) Commission's 1991 Job Evaluations [374] A new set of job evaluations was undertaken by the Commission staff in 1991 for use in its Final Investigation Stage. These involved 93 CR positions (reduced by the Commission from the original 194) and 10 `generic' PO jobs. The possible use of the evolving System One job evaluation plan was considered by the Commission but discarded in favour of the off-the-shelf Hay XYZ Job Evaluation Plan.\nHow were the job evaluations of the sample of 93 CR positions and 10 \"generic\" PO jobs actually conducted in 1991?\n[375] The Commission evaluation work was now to be a comparison between the sampled CR positions and 10 `generic' PO jobs, the creation of which had resulted, essentially, from the inability of the Commission and Canada Post to agree on sample sizes and data collection instruments for the comparator PO positions. The Commission had consulted Statistics Canada and received its recommendation concerning stratified random sampling of the PO community, comprising internal, external and supervisory sub-groups, and had planned to proceed using the Job Fact Sheet questionnaire. Canada Post, however, would not allow PO incumbents to complete the Job Fact Sheet on company time. The union representing the PO's would not allow their membership to participate in \"after hours\" unpaid work. As a result, the Commission opted to use the information made available to them by Canada Post, and, using that information, created a grouping of `generic' PO job categories - covering both internal and external operational functions, but excluding the PO supervisors. The 10 `generic' jobs were, therefore, not actual positions but represented the ten mostly homogeneous jobs done by PO incumbents.\n[376] The creation of the 10 `generic' PO jobs involved the dropping, by the Commission, of the PO supervisors subgroup (PO-SUP). This was a significant action as the PO-SUP subgroup represented 6 different levels of supervision with a large number of job titles. Many of the titles occurred at more than one level, making it difficult to reconcile them into `job specifications' without a sampling of incumbents and use of a Job Fact Sheet, or questionnaire. With the Commission's decision to move to the 10 `generic' PO jobs, it was considered too onerous and delaying to sort out the PO-SUP situation with Canada Post. While the Alliance was consulted, Canada Post was only advised of this decision. One important result was an inconsistency with the CR sample. That sample included supervisors at the CR-5 level.\n[377] Commission staff received a short period of training in the use of the standard XYZ Hay Plan from a senior manager at Hay Canada, Mr. Roger Childerhose. After the training period, the Commission's senior investigator and one other senior officer began evaluating, individually, 16 positions which they pronounced to be Benchmark positions (10 CR positions and 6 `generic' PO jobs). This new evaluation work began in July 1991. They then jointly reviewed and \"sore-thumbed\" all 16, and periodically consulted with the Commission's Director - Pay Equity, Mr. Paul Durber. The two officers continued to re-evaluate CR-2's and CR-3's, intending to re-evaluate all of the original sample of 194 CR's and to evaluate the 10 PO \"generics\". The senior investigator was called off the job to handle other priorities, and the second officer continued on her own. She was subsequently joined by another officer plus an outside consultant. All three then rated batches of CR and `generic' PO jobs individually, followed by periodic informal joint review and \"sore-thumbing\". This \"team\" was of mixed gender.\n[378] By September 1991, partway through the re-evaluations of the CR's, the officer-in-charge was asked to reduce the original sample of 194 CR's to a more workable number. After studying this situation, she proposed a revised level of 93 which was accepted by the Commission as the new sample.\n[379] The Commission's evaluators used the off-the-shelf Hay XYZ Evaluation Plan for both the 93 CR and the 10 PO positions\/jobs. It was this Plan which was the basis for their training session with the Hay organization. The sources of job information for the CR's was essentially the same as used in the 1987 evaluations - the relevant 1986 Job Fact Sheets and supporting job descriptions, organization charts and Interview Guides. For the `generic' PO jobs, data was drawn from `job specifications', which the Commission had compiled from information provided by Canada Post management, in 1990 and 1991, as well as from job descriptions and job profiles, also furnished by Canada Post.\n[380] As with the 1987 evaluations, the Commission used the completed Job Fact Sheet as its primary source of job information for the 93 CR evaluations. For the PO evaluations, the `job specifications' were regarded as the primary source.\n[381] It was, therefore, upon these evaluations of 93 CR positions and 10 `generic' PO jobs, which were completed by November 1991, that the Commission based its investigation findings. These, in turn, led to the conclusions of the Commission's Final Investigation Report of January 1992, including the recommendation that the Complaint be sent to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for a hearing.\nF. Review Of Job Information Collected And Methodology Used: Tribunal Stage (i) The Professional Team [382] Early in 1993, with the Tribunal's proceedings well underway, the Alliance engaged a three-person team of professional job evaluators (hereinafter called the `Professional Team') to provide an expert review of the Commission's 1991 evaluations of 93 CR positions and 10 `generic' PO jobs, and to undertake independent evaluations. The Professional Team was comprised of the following persons:\nDr. Bernard Ingster has engaged in a consulting practice in human resources matters since 1967, including job classification and evaluation. During an early part of his career, he served as Director of Services, Hay Associates, Philadelphia, and between 1971 and 1977 he had an independent affiliation with Hay while working with clients. Since 1977, Dr. Ingster has operated as an independent consultant in fields such as organization and job structure analysis and design, compensation systems, performance assessment practices and job evaluation plan development. His clients have ranged from industrial companies to public health facilities to educational institutions and law firms. Dr. Ingster earned his doctorate at Rutgers University after acquiring degrees at LaSalle College (Philadelphia) and Temple University.\nDr. Martin G. Wolf obtained his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in 1958 and 1959 respectively from the University of North Texas, majoring in Psychology. He earned his Ph.D. in 1964 from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, primarily in clinical psychology with a minor in industrial psychology. Dr. Wolf began his career with the IBM Corporation in the field of personnel administration and then spent time in the late 1960's with a management consulting firm dealing with the improvement of employee training programs and human resources policies and procedures. He subsequently spent time as a Management Psychologist analysing knowledge, skills and abilities requirements of positions. In the early 1970's he became self employed as a management consultant in Cleveland specializing in sales training programs, executive searches and computerized tracking systems. Dr. Wolf joined Hay Management Consultants in 1974 serving at their Pittsburgh facility until 1981, and then at their Philadelphia site until 1989. During his Hay career he worked extensively with a variety of clients in developing job evaluation, performance enhancement and compensation systems. His last position at Hay was as Corporate Director, Technology Development. Dr. Wolf founded his own consulting operation in 1989 - MAS Management Advisory Services Inc. and was still active in that organization when he appeared before the Tribunal. Areas of emphasis for his company have been the development and implementation of computer-supported job evaluation, salary administration and performance enhancement systems as well as conducting change management projects. Dr. Wolf appeared before the Tribunal as spokesperson for the Professional Team and testified that he had spent 30 years in job evaluation including about 20 years working with the Hay process. He had served as a \"correlator\" at Hay - a \"keeper of the flame\" role in maintaining the integrity of the Hay system. He estimated that he had evaluated \"slightly upwards of 10,000\" jobs using the Hay process, including office clerical, and payroll systems jobs, and, in his early days, some blue collar jobs. He was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in Hay-based job evaluation and Hay-based compensation.\nMs. Judith Davidson-Palmer, President, EEO Associates, consultants on equity issues, including organizational development and change, and pay and employment equity issues. From 1982 to 1985, Ms. Davidson-Palmer served as National Director - Management and Organization Development, Canada Post Corporation, at its Head Office. She is a graduate of Mount Allison University and obtained her Master of Arts in Psychology from Queen's University.\n[383] The Alliance's evidence indicated that, before the Professional Team came together, Dr. Ingster had spent a week with Alliance representatives reviewing the job content materials that the Commission had used for its evaluations. This included copies of completed Job Fact Sheets, position descriptions and Interview Guides. Dr. Ingster concluded that the available documentation could be used for job evaluation purposes by a committee of professionals.\n[384] Dr. Ingster was asked to provide \"an expert review of the evaluations of 93 Clerical and Regulatory positions and 10 PO jobs that had been developed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission\".121 The Professional Team, as a whole, was then asked to \"apply the Hay Method to the job content in accordance with the `best practices' of senior level Hay consultants considered to be expert in the use of the process\".122\n(ii) Phases 1 and 2 [385] The Team undertook its task in two phases, as follows:\nPhase 1 involved the re-evaluation of the Commission's 1991 sample of 93 CR positions and of the 10 `generic' PO jobs; this was tackled in May\/June 1993.\nPhase 2 involved the evaluation of a further 101 CR positions which was undertaken in November\/December 1994. This number represented the remaining balance from the Commission's original 1987 sample of 194 (194 less 93). Subsequently, 4 positions for which the Professional Team felt there was inadequate data were deleted for a revised total of 97 additional CR positions, and a grand total of 190 CR positions evaluated.\n[386] The Professional Team called the job evaluation methodology it employed in undertaking its evaluations the Hay factor comparison approach or \"the classic Hay Standard\". Dr. Ingster indicated that this was an application of the Hay Method \"in strict accord with its factor comparison origins\".123 Dr. Wolf defined this as the approach that was originally designed by the Hay organization where one assesses the content of each job against the structure of factors provided in the Hay Plan as know-how, problem solving, accountability and working conditions. One compares progressively each job, factor-by-factor, to the next and subsequent jobs. This methodology has also been referred to as a job-to-job comparison of total job content on a factor-by-factor basis. Since the Team considered the working conditions factor to be the least developed of the Hay Plan factors, it created a more elaborate working conditions guide chart for use in this set of evaluations.\n[387] What were the principal sources of job information for the Professional Team's evaluations in each of Phase 1 and Phase 2? The Alliance supplied the Professional Team with the following materials from which to draw information:\nPhase 1- 93 CR's (May\/June 1993)\nthe relevant 1986 completed Job Fact Sheets job descriptions attached to the 1986 Job Fact Sheets organization charts attached to the 1986 Job Fact Sheets the relevant 1986 completed Interview Guides the Commission's Rationale Statements from its 1991 evaluations, which was usually a single-sheet summary listing of the principal duties and features of each position evaluated, factor by factor, and of the evaluators' ratings and scores, and reasoning behind them, also by factor the Professional Team also had access to their own notes, created during telephone interviews which the Team had made in May 1993 with CR incumbents.\nPhase 1 - 10 PO `Generics' (May\/June 1993)\n`job specifications' compiled by the Commission based on data obtained from Canada Post in 1990 and 1991 job descriptions obtained by the Commission from Canada Post in 1990 and 1991 profiles describing characteristics of a number of PO jobs obtained by the Commission from Canada Post behavioural dimensions obtained by the Commission from Canada Post the Commission's Rationale Statements from its 1991 evaluations a variety of Canada Post manuals, handbooks, forms, and training materials.\nPhase 2 - 101 CR's (November\/December 1994)\nthe relevant 1986 completed Job Fact Sheets job descriptions attached to the 1986 Job Fact Sheets organization charts attached to the 1986 Job Fact Sheets the relevant 1986 completed Interview Guides the Professional Team also used their evaluations of the 93 CR positions in Phase 1 to serve as Reference Positions in evaluating the 101 (eventually 97) CR positions in Phase 2, because of the overlap in position content the Team also had access to their own notes, created during telephone interviews with incumbents, made by the Team in September 1994.\n[388] The primary source of job information for the CR's was the position descriptions. These were accepted as received. The primary source of job information for the `generic' PO jobs was the `job specification' created by the Commission for each of the 10 `generic' PO jobs.\n(iii) How were the Job Evaluations conducted by the Professional Team? [389] Phase 1: The Professional Team began by meeting in Ottawa in May 1993 to conduct telephone interviews with the 93 CR incumbents of Phase 1. All three Team members participated in the interviews by conference call, with one member taking the lead in conducting and preparing notes on the interview. Dr. Ingster had allocated the list of 93 incumbents three-ways, so each Team member took the lead for one-third of the calls.\n[390] A major purpose of these telephone interviews was to seek additional information about the work environment of the position occupied by each interviewee. This was done because, in the opinion of the Team, the working conditions factor was the least well-documented aspect of the 1986 Job Fact Sheet and other materials the Team had at hand. A second reason was to enable Team members to ask questions they might have from their earlier scanning of the job materials. Interviewees had been alerted to the calls and had before them copies of the relevant Job Fact Sheet and supporting documents. Each was being asked about his or her position as it existed in 1986.\n[391] All CR incumbents reached by telephone were interviewed. For some who could not be reached, employees who had occupied the same position in the past, or employees currently occupying a related position might stand-in for the actual 1986 incumbent. Occasionally, the appropriate supervisor might respond. Actual numbers of such stand-ins are not known. Of the total of 93 possible telephone interviews, however, it is known that 59 were completed.\n[392] Following the Phase 1 telephone interviews, the Professional Team met, in May\/June 1993, in Philadelphia, to undertake the evaluation of the 93 CR positions and the 10 PO `generic' jobs. Dr. Ingster served as chair. The Team set a target of evaluating between 10 and 11 jobs per day over a 10-day period. Each member of the Team had received the job information materials earlier.\n[393] The assembled members began by arranging the job information in ascending order of the total job evaluation points that had been assigned by the Commission's evaluation team in their evaluations of 93 CR positions and 10 `generic' PO jobs in 1991; this information came from the Commission's Rationale Statement. An identifying number from 1 to 103 was then assigned to this resulting order of positions\/jobs.\n[394] Normally, each job was discussed before starting the evaluation process. This was done to clarify any questions Team members might have had or to highlight a particular aspect of the job concerned. The Team then proceeded to assess the job content and to assign a rating for each Hay factor and, progressively, to compare those ratings on a job-to-job basis. In most cases, there was eventually unanimity of the three members in reaching agreement on individual factor ratings. As a minimum, a consensus of two could prevail but never by just a simple vote, only after discussion.\n[395] At the start of each day, the members reviewed their decisions and ratings of the previous day, referring to their respective notes. This was to ensure accuracy in their joint recording of the previous day's work. Dr. Wolf did not make notes, but inputted the factor and sub-factor ratings into the computer, during the rating process.\n[396] Phase 2: The three Team members attempted to conduct telephone interviews with the 97 CR incumbents of Phase 2. This was done in a similar manner to that described above for Phase 1. These interview contacts were attempted from Ottawa in September 1994. Of the total of 97 possible telephone interviews, 55 were completed.\n[397] Following the Phase 2 telephone interviews, the Team met in November\/December 1994, in Philadelphia, to undertake the evaluation of the 97 CR positions. Again, Dr. Ingster served as chair. The Team set a target to evaluate about 10 jobs per day over a 10-day period; it actually took 9 days. The same evaluation process as described above for Phase 1 was followed by the Team, with one difference - the full set of 93 evaluated positions of Phase 1 was used as Reference Positions. A `Reference Position' has important job content characteristics which are useful for comparison with an unevaluated position. Given the similarity in positions content between the Phase 1 and Phase 2 sampled CR positions, the Phase 1 positions made suitable Reference Positions for the Phase 2 evaluations.\n[398] It is usual practice for those completing job evaluations to prepare, for record purposes, a statement of the reasoning that went into the Evaluation Plan used, the process followed, and the ratings reached, factor-by-factor. In the case of the Commission, this was achieved through its \"Rationale Statement\". In the case of the Professional Team, it was by means of an \"Audit Trail\". An Audit Trail was included in the Professional Team's Report to the Alliance covering its evaluations in Phases 1 and 2.\n(iv) Two Additional Reviews [399] The Professional Team was asked to participate in two additional exercises with possible impact on its earlier evaluations (Phases 1 and 2). The first, which occurred in June 1997, was to review a number of newly found job documents. These documents had been misplaced when the Commission moved its office space; they were found in the spring of 1997. The found documents included items such as several previously missing job descriptions, more legible photocopies, and clarification of French translations. The documentation affected 89 of the 190 CR positions which had been evaluated in Phases 1 and 2.\n[400] The question to be answered by the Team was whether the newly found material would have had any effect on the earlier evaluations had it been available when those evaluations were being done. It was addressed by only one Team member, Dr. Wolf. His conclusion was that, with one possible minor exception, nothing significant had been added to the original job information. The new material simply served to confirm the Team's previous evaluation results.\n[401] The second exercise was completed after the Alliance, in June 2000, requested that the Professional Team review the evidence of a number of Canada Post witnesses who had appeared before the Tribunal since Dr. Wolf's last testimony. This involved about 4,000 pages of written material, including transcripts for about 70 days of testimony and cross-examination, and supporting documents, manuals and related material regarding job content. These documents dealt with the PO jobs, primarily. The Alliance had requested this review to determine what impact the additional evidence presented by Canada Post might have had on the Team's 1993 and 1994 evaluations of CR positions and PO jobs.\n[402] The Professional Team's Report concerning the Respondent's voluminous evidence was entered as Reply evidence. Before the group convened to consider the Respondent's evidence, Dr. Wolf read through the transcripts of testimony from all 70 days and through the supporting material. The Team gave him the task to assess the new material's potential usefulness for job evaluation purposes. He screened on the basis of three criteria - relevance, appropriateness and duplication. This resulted in some 36 days of testimony evidence and associated material on which he directed his two colleagues to focus. The three Team members then met and jointly conducted their review over a 5-day period.\n[403] After a careful study of the lengthy screened material, it became clear to the Team that the actual work performed by an incumbent of any one of the 10 `generic' PO jobs could vary widely depending on location. The Team determined that the evidence demonstrated the following:\n\"the use of a single generic description for each of these 10 jobs results in a document that probably describes accurately few, if any, of the many incumbents of these multi-faceted jobs\", and \"all of the 10 PO jobs appear to reflect an amalgam of sub-jobs, some of which might fall at different Hay evaluation levels, based on the actual task mix at various locations\".124\n[404] Faced with this finding, the Team indicated that, in fairness to the job evaluation process, it chose to give the benefit of the doubt to the PO jobs and to assess each based on what appeared to be the highest level of tasks commonly performed by an incumbent of that job. The Team examined all 10 `generic' jobs and compared them against similarly levelled CR positions using the Hay factor comparison approach. Members asked themselves whether, as a result of the additional evidence, they now had a different understanding of the jobs than what they had originally.\n[405] The Team found that much of the new information provided by Canada Post's witnesses was not relevant to job evaluation. In particular, the Team concluded that none of its original CR position evaluations were affected by the additional evidence. In fact, Dr. Wolf testified that he did not revisit, during the June 2000 exercise, the 1993\/1994 CR evaluations, having accepted them as a given.125 The Team did, however, acknowledge that the new evidence confirmed that the range of variation in individual incumbent duties for the 10 `generic' PO jobs was much greater than the Team had originally understood it to be.\n[406] Few changes in total evaluation scores resulted from this review. Of the 10 PO jobs, five were completely unchanged and three had changes of three points or less. Two jobs, however, changed significantly, one of which increased and one of which decreased in total evaluation value.\nG. Reliability of Job Information Collected, Methodology Used and Job Evaluations conducted by the Commission and the Professional Team: - Positions of the Professional Team, Canada Post, the Alliance and the Commission\n(i) The Standard of Reliability [407] Having focused on how the job information was collected, processed and used for evaluation purposes, it is now appropriate to consider the reliability of the job information, the methodology and the evaluations performed by both the Commission and the Professional Team.\n[408] What standard of reliability should the Tribunal use? While all three parties in this Complaint have agreed that they are not seeking perfection, per se, it is necessary to determine what is an acceptable reliability standard in the context of this particular \"pay equity\" situation.\n[409] The decision of the tribunal in the Treasury Board case, which rules out any absolute standard of correctness, is of assistance in this regard:\nWhat is apparent from these comments and from the nature of the subject is that equal pay for work of equal value is a goal to be striven for which cannot be measured precisely and which ought not to be subjected to any absolute standard of correctness. Moreover, gender neutrality in an absolute sense is probably unattainable in an imperfect world and one should therefore be satisfied with reasonably accurate results based on what is, according to one's good sense, a fair and equitable resolution of any discriminatory differentiation between wages paid to males and wages paid to females for doing work of equal value.126\n[410] Also, Mr. Justice Evans' decision of October 1999 supports a flexible case-by-case approach to the determination of how the concept of equal pay for work of equal value is to be effected, as follows:\nIn short, the correct interpretation of section 11 in my opinion is that Parliament intended to confer on the agencies created to administer the Act a margin of appreciation in determining on a case-by-case basis, and with the assistance of technical expertise available, how the statutorily endorsed principle of equal pay for work of equal value is to be given effect in any given employment setting.127\n[411] Finally, Mr. Justice Hugessen's decision of June 1996 in the Department of National Defence case, reiterates the civil burden of proof required of a complainant as being the balance of probabilities which is \"...a long way from certainty...\":\nThe burden which a complainant before a Human Rights Tribunal must carry cannot, in my opinion, be placed any higher than the ordinary civil burden of the balance of probabilities. That is a long way from certainty and simply means that the complainant must show that his position is more likely than not.128\n[412] These rulings support a call for a standard of reasonableness, there being no such thing as absolute reliability. The application of such a standard will depend very much on the context of the situation under examination. The issue is, then, given all the circumstances of the case before this Tribunal, is it more likely than not that the job information, from its various sources, the evaluation system and the process employed, and the resulting evaluations are, despite any weaknesses, sufficiently adequate to enable a fair and reasonable conclusion to be reached, as to whether or not, under section 11 of the Act, there were differences in wages for work of equal value, between the complainant and comparator employees concerned?\n[413] Focusing specifically on the job information and data used in this case, a further means of determining whether they are reasonably reliable is to test them against a generally accepted practice of the job evaluation industry. That is the industry's objective of seeking, to the extent possible, accuracy, consistency and completeness in job information being used for job evaluation purposes. Accuracy calls for the data to be correct. Consistency recognizes the need for the same kind of information and generally the same level of detail and quality across all jobs being evaluated. Completeness relates to ensuring that important information about a job is not missed and that the collected data is compatible with the job evaluation plan being used.\n[414] A very important factor affecting the Tribunal's judgement about the reasonable reliability of the job information collected, the methodology employed and the evaluation of jobs\/positions, is the evidence provided by a number of expert witnesses. Equally important, is the fact that several of these expert witnesses significantly disagreed with, and even sometimes contradicted, each other.\n[415] Under these circumstances, the Tribunal found it helpful to examine the evidence of these particular expert witnesses in a very systematic manner to ensure consistency and fairness of treatment.\n[416] In compiling the elements that should comprise the systematic approach, the Tribunal was influenced by two recent Court decisions.\n[417] The first is a reference, in a Federal Court of Appeal decision dated April 5, 2004, to a discussion of the notion of witness credibility in the reasons offered by O'Halloran, J.A. in Faryna v. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 at 356-357 (B.C.C.A.):\n...the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.129\n[418] The second is a reference in a Federal Court decision dated April 14, 2004, to a discussion of the duties and responsibilities of an expert witness in the reasons offered by Cresswell, J. in National Justice Compania Riviera S.A. v. Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. (\"the Ikarian Reefer\"), [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 68 at 81:\n...expert evidence presented to the Court should be, and should be seen to be, an independent product of the expert uninfluenced as to form or content by the exigencies of litigation. The expert witness should provide independent assistance to the Court by way of objective unbiased opinion in relation to matters within his or her expertise.130\n[419] The systematic approach that the Tribunal applied in examining the evidence of the expert witnesses concerned was as follows:\nWhat is the expert qualified to give evidence about, and what Party is calling the expert witness? What is the expert's mandate? What is the extent of the expert's knowledge and experience, and his or her standing in the field of expertise concerned? How did the expert fulfill his or her mandate? What conclusions did the expert reach? How did the expert present his or her conclusions to the Tribunal? What weight does the Tribunal give to the conclusions of the expert?\n[420] It is, therefore, time to test for this standard of reasonableness of reliability with the job evaluation undertakings of the Commission and the Professional Team.\n(ii) Commission's 1987 Job Evaluations [421] While the 1987 CR evaluation results were not used in the Commission's Final Investigation process, it is, nonetheless, particularly pertinent to test the reliability of the 1986 instruments and resulting job information, since much of that information and data were employed in the succeeding evaluations.\n[422] The Job Fact Sheet or Questionnaire, while completed in 1986 by only a sampling of CR incumbents, was originally planned for use by both CR and PO employees. It was clearly intended to be the most important source of up-to-date job information. In fact, the Commission chose it as its primary source for its 1987 CR evaluations. Yet, according to Canada Post, the design and content of the Job Fact Sheet were seriously flawed. Canada Post indicated both in its submissions to the Tribunal and to the Commission, at the time, that the Job Fact Sheet was self-evaluative in design, a feature considered quite unacceptable for job evaluation purposes. When it made its objections to the Commission, Canada Post proposed major changes and even offered its own design but the Commission declined both options, and chose to carry on with its own format. Moreover, the Job Fact Sheet was designed to relate to the System One evaluation scheme. This evaluation scheme was neither fully developed nor was its use entirely acceptable, at the time, to the Alliance and to Canada Post.\n[423] The Job Fact Sheet did not meet the Commission's subsequent model which stated that a Questionnaire \"...must be carefully designed and tested, possibly through a pilot study...\".131 The Job Fact Sheet was designed and developed by a senior Commission employee under pressure of time and human resources constraints, and without professional assistance. The formulation of pertinent questions and their order and style of presentation in a crucial survey document to be presented to employees working in a large, busy and dynamic organization with a long history of sensitive labour relations, such as Canada Post, required appropriate professional expertise. The Job Fact Sheet was not the product of such expertise.\n[424] Certainly, the Job Fact Sheet was neither designed nor tested by an independent, professional body. All four persons who `tested' the questionnaire were clerical\/secretarial workers. No PO-type workers were involved. The results of the test were checked by the lead investigator, who found that the four involved in the testing of the questionnaire had frequently over-rated their respective jobs on a number of factors. This led to some changes in the document but the revised final version was never re-tested.\n[425] Two other instruments, considered important job information sources, were job descriptions and organization charts, both of which were to be attached to the Job Fact Sheet by each CR incumbent who completed it. As Canada Post had warned, many of the job descriptions were out-of-date, some dated well before 1986. Indeed, a number were missing, some were \"unofficial\", and others bore no signature of approval. Additionally, the Alliance was not satisfied that all the job descriptions had been union-endorsed, an accepted right of the union concerned. An almost similar situation prevailed with regard to the organization charts. They were of varying ages, and some were missing.\n[426] The Interview Guide, intended to assist the Commission's investigator in subsequently conducting interviews with employees and to record their responses, elicited reservations about its design and use from both the Alliance and Canada Post. These concerns were never fully resolved. It was, like the Job Fact Sheet, designed around the System One evaluation plan.\n[427] Canada Post proposed several major changes in the format of the Interview Guide. The Commission chose not to make the proposed changes.\n[428] The Alliance, through one of its representatives, had observed the use of the Interview Guide in four of the initial run of interviews and had, as a result, proposed several modifications to improve it. Only a few of these modifications were accepted by the Commission. This decision to accept changes to the Interview Guide was reached after Commission staff had begun to use the original version. Hence, the changes in the document were made in the midst of its use which is not a recommended action in job evaluation circles.\n[429] Furthermore, the Commission's lead investigator testified that the Commission normally used an Interview Guide selectively with employee respondents where it was necessary to clear up inconsistencies or other difficulties with responses provided in particular Job Fact Sheets. In this case, the Commission, for reasons unknown to the lead investigator who was not in its employ at this time in the evaluation process, chose to attempt to interview the entire CR sample.\n[430] Another factor which caused some consternation was the origin of the CR sample size. A Commission senior staff member had developed a random stratified sample without prior professional input. His sample calculations went through a number of configurations with extra \"alternates\", but only 194 acceptable Job Fact Sheet responses were received. This became the number of CR positions that were eventually evaluated. Statistics Canada, who was consulted subsequently by the Commission, recommended that the sample size be augmented. This suggestion was not implemented by the Commission.\n[431] Finally, the process followed by the Commission Evaluation Team was somewhat unusual. Three of the Team's members rotated as evaluators. There was little evidence presented concerning the extent of the job evaluation training given to these Commission evaluators, or their individual experience as job evaluators.\n(iii) Commission's 1991 Job Evaluations [432] As already noted, the Commission relied on its 1991 evaluations of 93 CR positions and 10 `generic' PO jobs as the basis for reaching its Final Investigation conclusions, and recommendations. The Commission had stated that it would be using the Hay System with its four-factor approach and its XYZ charts to establish value. The Commission was of the view that this Hay version was \"...quite capable of measuring `blue collar' and office-environment jobs\".132\n[433] Neither Canada Post nor the Alliance were in full harmony with the Commission's use, in 1991, of the Hay Job Evaluation Plan. Canada Post, in particular, felt that the Hay Plan was intended, primarily, for \"white collar\" and management-type work.\n[434] Interestingly, Dr. Wolf, in answering a question from counsel for the Alliance, referred to the evaluation methodology used by the Commission, as follows:\nEssentially, what the Human Rights Commission evaluators did was to create their own evaluation methodology ... they explicitly said that they were not using anything like traditional Hay methodology. They said they were using an `equal value' approach to job evaluation ... I don't know what you would call what they did, but it was not the Hay process.133\n[435] There was also a certain incompatibility in the use of the Hay Plan with a Job Fact Sheet that had been designed to relate to the System One plan. However, System One, incomplete as it might have been, was said to be closely aligned to the Hay Plan. It had four factors for assessing the value of work, as does the Hay Plan. Both plans were considered by the Alliance to be weaker for PO employees than they should be with respect to the working conditions factor.\n[436] As with the 1987 evaluations, the Job Fact Sheet was used by the Commission as its primary source of job data for the 1991 CR evaluations. In contrast, the primary source for the PO evaluations was the `job specifications' compiled by the Commission. The resulting comparison between complainant CR positions occupied by particular incumbents with the comparator `generic' PO jobs can be faulted as not being a proper comparison, given that the generic jobs were not actual positions, with incumbents. This is one example of the inconsistent treatment which the job information imposed upon any evaluation team attempting to evaluate these particular positions\/jobs in a \"pay equity\" context.\n[437] The reduction in the CR sample from 194 in 1987 to 93 in 1991 seemed to be prompted by the need to speed up the evaluation process. Calculation of the revised sample of 93 was handled by one of the Commission's evaluators, an obviously well intentioned employee, but not a sampling expert. There is even a suspicion that the sample of 93 may be unfairly weighted. This suspicion arises because all 10 CR benchmarks which were developed at the start of the 1991 evaluations, and all CR positions in Canada Post's Head Office, are understood to have been automatically included in the \"sample\" of 93. This belies any suggestion that the sample of 93 was randomly selected.\n[438] The Commission's 1991 evaluations were not conducted within the confines of the Commission's recommended committee structure. Commission staff evaluated individually, and came together periodically to compare ratings.\n[439] Mr. Paul Durber of the Commission, indicated in his evidence to the Tribunal in June 1993 that he thought the evaluation process followed by the Commission in 1991 fell between a minimum and an ideal process, where the ideal would be a joint employer\/employee study.134 While he was \"satisfied with the quality and consistency of the product\" of the evaluations, Mr. Durber indicated that the evaluating team was not \"...an orthodox committee...\". For one thing, its process \"...was something of a departure ... [as] normally the Commission had followed - always as far as [he knew], for group cases - had followed a strict committee approach...\". By `orthodox', Mr. Durber indicated that he meant a committee structure where all its members come together, with their individual ratings and, by a process of consensus building, jointly reach a mutually acceptable conclusion. This was missing in the Commission's committee where its members worked individually, coming together to exchange ratings.\n(iv) Professional Team's 1993\/1994 Job Evaluations [440] The Alliance and the Commission have chosen to rely exclusively on the evaluations performed in 1993\/1994 by the Professional Team in attempting to substantiate the Complaint before this Tribunal. A number of changes in evaluation scores made in June 2000 have revised the Team's original evaluation values.\n[441] At least two members of the Professional Team were extremely comfortable with the Hay Evaluation Plan, and with using it to conduct the evaluations for this Tribunal hearing. Both Dr. Wolf and Dr. Ingster had spent considerable time in the Hay organization and had worked over many years with clients using the Hay Plan. Moreover, in the interest of thoroughness, the Team applied what it termed the factor comparison, or classic Hay Standard, which it considered to be a more diligent, time-consuming approach than the \"fast track\" Hay guide chart options.\n[442] Dr. Wolf, spokesperson for the Professional Team, and accepted as an expert in Hay-based job evaluation, indicated that it was his opinion that the Hay Plan was generally regarded as being capable of measuring the relative value of male-predominant and female-predominant jobs. Additionally, the Hay Plan's factors measured work value based on a composite of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions, as required by the Act.\n[443] Questions continued to be raised, however, concerning the suitability of the Hay Plan for use with clerical and `blue-collar' jobs, given its current widely known use for evaluation of management-level work. This was certainly a concern of the Alliance, as well as of Canada Post. Dr. Wolf stated that the Hay Plan, in its earliest days, had been used in the evaluation of `blue collar' work but, in more recent times, client demand had been increasingly in the management area. While Dr. Wolf did admit that most of Hay's job evaluation is now with supervisory, management, and professional jobs, he and his two colleagues felt it was quite adaptable to both `blue collar' and clerical jobs.135 This opinion was especially true, he indicated, when one was dealing with evaluators experienced in applying Hay. In addition, the expansion of the Hay working conditions factor, by the Team, was illustrative of its adaptability.\n[444] While the Hay Plan may be considered an acceptable one for use in these evaluations - particularly in the hands of the well-qualified Professional Team - the sources of much of the data used raise many questions. The Job Fact Sheet, intended, when first designed, to serve as the primary source of up-to-date job information, proved to be entirely unacceptable as noted earlier. Indeed, so unreliable did the Professional Team consider the Job Fact Sheet that the Team largely discarded it and used the job descriptions as its primary document for its CR evaluations.\n[445] Perhaps the most telling comment about the Job Fact Sheet was that of Dr. Wolf himself. He testified before the Tribunal in April 1995, as follows:\nThe job documents that were done by the Canadian Human Rights Commission required an awful lot of interpretation because the form they used was abominable. The guy who developed it probably should be taken out and shot.\nIt violated the basic rule of any job documentation process which is that you ask individuals to describe the jobs, not evaluate them. The way it was structured ... asking people to self-evaluate. So we disregarded that totally because people can't evaluate their own jobs because they don't understand the process.136\n[446] In addition to its `abominable' structure, the Job Fact Sheet was designed, as noted earlier, to relate to the System One plan. There would seem to be potential conflict in using job information, even in a less than primary role, provided by means of an instrument based on an evaluation plan different from the one being used for the evaluations. The Commission's model stresses that \"... use of a single plan to evaluate all jobs is essential\".137\n[447] Use of the job descriptions as the primary document for the CR evaluations posed its own problem. Dr. Wolf testified that the Team had accepted the job descriptions as they were, provided they were in correct Canada Post format, on the assumption that they had been the basis of Canada Post's classification of those positions.\n[448] Unfortunately, there was not a consistently compatible quality set of job descriptions for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 CR evaluations, including no standard format of presentation. As already noted, the job descriptions were of varying ages. Some went back many years. Others were not considered by the Alliance to be \"official\" versions, even though they were more current in age. A number were missing. Dr. Wolf acknowledged in cross-examination that 14 were missing from Phase 1, and 11 from Phase 2 evaluations. Subsequently, in June 1997, one of the missing CR job descriptions for Phase 1 was found, and three were found for Phase 2. Additionally, 5 available job descriptions were considered to be inconsistent with the Job Fact Sheet, and, therefore, were not used. There were even examples of missing pages from some job descriptions. Some 50-job descriptions were not signed or dated. Finally, the job descriptions did not generally include information on working conditions. These deficiencies raise the issue of the consistency, completeness and accuracy of that aspect of the job data.\n[449] These problems seriously damaged the credibility of many of the job descriptions, especially in their role for the Professional Team as the primary source of CR job information. Even the Commission's model recognized that job descriptions are not always an up-to-date and accurate reflection of work done and often replicate prevailing stereotypes in the workplace, and should not be used as the primary source of data.\n[450] The matter of sample size of a total job population is a factor which generally requires professional expertise. In this case, a random sample of CR positions should be of sufficient size that it can, with some degree of confidence, be characterized as representative of all the work undertaken by the total CR population. Adding or deleting from the sample size may impact on the average value of work within both the sample and the total population. The same is true of a stratified random sample, an example of which is the Commission's breakdown of the total 194 CR positions into individual samples for each of the CR-2, 3, 4, and 5 levels.\n[451] The development in 1986 of the original CR sample size and the subsequent \"re-calculations\" culminating in the final sample size of 194 was a non-professional process which was further discredited by the reduction to 93 in 1991. The Professional Team did restore that reduced sample almost to its original level by evaluating a further 97 CR positions. Expert witnesses for Canada Post and for the Alliance gave evidence concerning how representative these samples were of the total CR population.\n[452] Canada Post called a witness, Dr. David Bellhouse, who first appeared before the Tribunal in January 1996.\n[453] Dr. Bellhouse attended as Professor of Statistics at the University of Western Ontario. He was also Chair of the Department of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences, having held that office since July 1992. He obtained bachelors and masters degrees at the University of Manitoba, and earned his doctorate at the University of Waterloo in 1975. His PhD dissertation was entitled \"Some results in sampling from a finite population under superpopulation models, 1975\". Dr. Bellhouse began his academic career in 1974 as Assistant Professor - Department of Statistics, University of Manitoba. He later joined the University of Western Ontario and moved through the ranks of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor (with tenure) and full professorship. As Chair of his department, he serves as Director of its Statistical Laboratory which undertakes the design and execution of statistical research and surveys for others on a cost-recovery basis. He estimated his research-teaching-administrative workload as being 40-20-40. Dr. Bellhouse has had many papers published in refereed (peer reviewed) journals in his field of expertise. He has identified some 40 such papers involving subjects such as sampling techniques and statistical modelling and analysis. In 1985, Dr. Bellhouse received his University's Gold Medal for Excellence in Teaching. Grants-in-aid-of-Research have been awarded annually, since 1976-77, by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council in support of Dr. Bellhouse's undertakings. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, his Fellowship having been awarded on the basis of his research in survey sampling. He is also an elected member of the International Statistical Institute.\n[454] Dr. Bellhouse was recognized by the Tribunal as an expert in statistics, with specialization in survey sampling [survey sampling comprises data collection and data analysis]. He noted that when one wishes to have individual information about all units of a population, one requires a census of all those units because \"the technique of random sample selection alone ... cannot provide any information on units which are not in the sample\".138 Dr. Bellhouse indicated in his Report that, in line with Dr. Wolf's agreement that the purpose of job evaluation is \"to try to compensate each position in accordance with its value\"139, one must use a complete census rather than a sample of any kind, as \"job evaluations of any sampled positions do not provide any information on the other positions which have not been sampled\".140\n[455] If, however, sampling is to be used, Dr. Bellhouse emphasized the scientific nature of this instrument, with the need for strict guidelines in order to avoid bias and to reach conclusions which would be useful for evaluation purposes. Amongst his conclusions concerning the sampling performed by the Commission, Dr. Bellhouse found that the initial sampling was an appropriate method to discover whether or not the current assignment of positions to the CR classification levels created for use by federal government departments, and then used by Canada Post, conformed to the non-overlapping intervals of points in the Hay Plan.\n[456] He went on to indicate that when it became obvious that CR classification levels were comprised of overlapping intervals of Hay Plan points, a census of all positions was necessary so that each and every position (or job) would be given a value through the job evaluation process.\n[457] Dr. Bellhouse concluded that, even if it were appropriate for use in evaluation, the Commission's original 1986 sampling design for the CR population was flawed in that it followed employees rather than positions. He considered that this choice of sampling employees rather than positions \"led to biases in the survey in the sense that there are positions that you are not able to sample\".141 He went on to conclude that these biases were compounded by a level of non-responses in the survey for which corrective follow-up action was not taken.\n[458] Dr. Bellhouse's conclusion concerning the PO occupational group was that since there was no \"probability sample\" of this occupational group, there was no valid sampling estimate of the average job evaluation value for each PO level. Indeed, because the job value by levels was measured differently for the PO and the CR groups - the CR group having been evaluated using positions and the PO group, using job titles - these evaluations cannot be used for comparison of job values between the two groups.\n[459] Dr. Bellhouse also concluded that there may be substantial selection bias in the PO sample because it was a selection of job titles rather than actual positions, and also because the job descriptions represented generic rather than actual job content. He cited the following example to illustrate his point:\nthere is the possibility of biases creeping into what is the actual value say for a letter carrier, because it is a generic job description and might not catch the variability in job value that is present in the general population.142\n[460] The Commission called a witness, Dr. John Kervin, who first appeared before the Tribunal in January 2002.\n[461] Dr. Kervin attended in his capacity as Professor in the Department of Sociology and as a researcher at the Centre for Industrial Relations, both of the University of Toronto. He obtained his B.A. in Sociology from the University of British Columbia and earned his doctorate at John Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1972. His PhD thesis was entitled \"An Information-Combining Model for the Formation of Performance Expectations in Small Groups\". Dr. Kervin began his academic career in 1971 as Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto and became Associate Professor (tenured) in 1976. He was cross appointed to the Centre for Industrial Relations in 1977 where his research work is largely carried out. Dr. Kervin indicated that an important part of his research and teaching academic life has been with respect to methodology statistics and data analysis and the effect of gender on social interaction. He has undertaken research projects such as \"Measuring Gender Bias in Wages\" and has had a number of refereed articles published including one entitled \"Where's the Bias?: Sources and Types of Gender Bias in Job Evaluation\". Clients seeking Dr. Kervin's research services have included the Management Board of the Ontario government and Treasury Board Canada, some of which involved statistical data analysis in a \"pay equity\" context. An example of Dr. Kervin working jointly, with another party, in this case with Dr. Nan Weiner, is \"Report on Possible Gender Bias in the Bank of Montreal's Hay-Points Compensation System - 1999\". Dr. Kervin is a member of the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association and of the American Sociological Association. He is also a member of three industrial relations associations.\n[462] The evidence of Dr. Kervin, presented as a witness for the Commission and qualified as an expert in data collection and data analysis (with `data analysis' including the use of statistics and statistical methodology), generally contradicts that of Dr. Bellhouse. Dr. Kervin's main criticism of Dr. Bellhouse's Report is that it is predicated upon an incorrect foundation. Whereas Dr. Bellhouse's Report stresses the analytical nature of statistical analysis and the need for scientific reliability, Dr. Kervin indicated that, when dealing with sociological phenomena, one must place the phenomena in the context of its social culture. In order to do this, the key component to data collection concerning the phenomena being studied is the initial formulation of the right question. He stated in his Report that Dr. Bellhouse never did ask the pertinent question, given the context of the Complaint.143 Dr. Bellhouse's concern was that the data analysis, using the data collected, follow the scientific method. That the analysis employ procedures and empirical evidence and tests that are replicable appeared to be his main concern. He grounded this concern in a belief that \"pay equity\" stands for the philosophy that everyone should be paid according to what his or her job is worth.\n[463] This is not, according to Dr. Kervin, correct. He felt that the real \"pay equity\" issue is \"is there a gender-based wage gap, controlling for the value of the work?\"144 This, Dr. Kervin's Report indicates, is because the concept of \"pay equity\" assumes that there is a gender-based bias in wages. What one wishes to do when testing for that assumption is to identify the jobs, the gender composition of those jobs, the job values, and the wages.\n[464] Dr. Kervin stated that he would want to look at the jobs both quantitatively as well as qualitatively, and with the judgement that comes from the \"art\" aspect of dealing with sociological questions. Dr. Bellhouse's Report did not take into consideration the \"art\" demands as well as the \"science\" demands of the Complaint. This difficulty, combined with his insistence that there be a correlation between the wages and classification levels, should negate Dr. Bellhouse's reported concerns about the Commission's sampling process, according to Dr. Kervin. The latter concern about the correlation between wages and classification levels indicates, according to Dr. Kervin, that Dr. Bellhouse does not understand the systemic foundations of the \"pay equity\" issue.\n[465] Dr. Kervin stated in his Report that Dr. Bellhouse's conclusions address, principally, issues of sampling and job value measurement. Dr. Kervin generally disagrees with these conclusions.\n[466] Specifically, Dr. Kervin was of the view that there is no need for a census of the total population concerned to meet the objective of \"pay equity\". A representative sample is more than adequate. He also argued that Dr. Bellhouse's rationale for use of a census - the overlap of Hay job points across CR classification levels - is invalid because the overlap is not due to sampling. It is due solely to the use of a different measure of the value of jobs. The overlap remains regardless of the type of sampling.\n[467] Dr. Kervin found invalid Dr. Bellhouse's argument that the 1986 sample design was flawed because it followed employees rather than positions and thereby led to biases and higher rates of non-response. Dr. Kervin stated that he discovered no evidence to support this position.\n[468] Dr. Kervin agreed with Dr. Bellhouse that the PO sample was not a probability or random sample, but rather a judgement sample. Unlike Dr. Bellhouse, however, Dr. Kervin argued that it was likely to be reasonably accurate. He felt that this was one of the examples where he and Dr. Bellhouse were pursuing different \"research questions\" - Dr. Bellhouse searching for statistical accuracy and significance, and Dr. Kervin addressing the needs of a \"pay equity\" situation.\n[469] Dr. Kervin disagreed with Dr. Bellhouse that there may be substantial selection bias in the PO sample. He argued that Dr. Bellhouse devoted no discussion to the manner of selection or to the possibility of selection bias due to the use of job titles and generic descriptions.\n[470] Finally, with respect to the measurement of job value at the level of job titles for the PO's and positions for the CR's, Dr. Kervin classified this as a difference in the unit of analysis and not as a difference in measurement. Dr. Kervin further stated that it is a situation that can be easily remedied.\n[471] Clearly, there is an appreciable difference of opinion, if not a contradiction, between these two expert witnesses on the issues of sampling and job value measurement.\n[472] The `job specifications' used for the 10 `generic' PO jobs were, in some ways, similar to the CR Job Fact Sheets. The information accumulated for them was provided by Canada Post, which also provided a number of PO job descriptions based on the job titles of the 10 \"generics\". Some of these job descriptions were \"unofficial\", not having had the endorsement of the relevant unions. While generally containing more up-to-date information than the CR Job Fact Sheets, the `job specifications' do not represent specific incumbent-held positions, but rather are an amalgam of functions for 10 commonly held job types. This results in a less than equal and compatible comparison between complainant and comparator jobs. Added to this is the fact that the gathering of the data was undertaken at different times - 1986 in the case of the CR's, and 1990-1991 in the case of the PO's. Such a time difference is usually considered unacceptable in a job evaluation exercise.\n[473] Canada Post argued, additionally, that the 10 `generic' PO jobs had been undervalued because certain aspects of \"sub-jobs\", such as the rotational work of the PO-4's, had been excluded during the Professional Team's evaluation process.\n[474] Although evaluation of the `generic' PO jobs was not dependent on the Job Fact Sheet, as the CR evaluations were originally meant to be, it relied heavily on the `job specifications' developed by the Commission. As already noted, these specifications were created, based on a variety of data acquired through a series of meetings with Canada Post management personnel. While appreciating why the Commission took this particular route, evidence before the Tribunal indicates that most job evaluation experts would not regard this information gathering methodology as a propitious approach. According to Dr. Pat Armstrong, an expert witness for the Commission, managers are generally too far removed from operational work to know it in the depth required for evaluation purposes. Contact with individual job incumbents is the favoured route. In fact, the job profiles made available by Canada Post for use by the Commission in developing its 10 PO `job specifications' posed their own difficulty because they were labelled \"draft\" and did not have union approval.\n[475] Because of the unusual nature of the information gathering techniques used by the Commission, the Professional Team had an over-abundance of job information about the PO community. In addition to the `job specifications', certain job descriptions, job profiles and behavioural dimensions were available. They also had access to various Canada Post manuals, handbooks, and other materials. When the evaluation work was done by the Team in June 2000, it had access to the very considerable evidence and supporting material of the Canada Post witnesses who testified largely about the functions and activities of PO workers. Although the Team's examination of all this documentation at that time led to few changes in their original evaluations, it did serve to fortify the PO job data already in hand, even if only in the configuration of the 10 `generic' PO jobs.\n[476] The 10 `generic' PO jobs do not represent any of the many jobs in the PO supervisor sub-group. Yet, the samples of CR incumbents do include some supervisors at the CR-5 level. This raises questions of consistency and completeness between the complainant and comparator groups.\n[477] Items such as organization charts and the Interview Guide were regarded as secondary and tertiary sources of CR job data. Difficulties with these two instruments have already been identified - dated and missing versions of the charts, and the dissatisfaction of both Canada Post and the Alliance primarily about the content and proposed use of the Interview Guide. In fact, Dr. Wolf testified that the Interview Guide did not add anything in particular to the Team's understanding of the CR incumbents' job duties.\n[478] Having access to the Commission's Rationale Statement brought criticism from Canada Post and its three key expert witnesses whose principal testimony is considered later in this section. Their concern related to the Professional Team's use of the Rationale Statement in preparing its primary listing of CR positions and PO jobs that it would evaluate. The Team's list was based on the Commission's total evaluation point scores in ascending order, which were identified in the Rationale Statement. The experts appearing before the Tribunal for Canada Post considered this to be unacceptable for an evaluation process, and felt that such use could have unfairly influenced eventual evaluation ratings.\n[479] The telephone interviews with CR incumbents conducted in advance of the actual evaluations undertaken by the Professional Team in Phases 1 and 2 were a well-intentioned exercise designed to improve the Team's job knowledge. Dr. Wolf acknowledged that the interviews focused, primarily, on working conditions and, with one or two exceptions, did not add anything significant beyond that aspect. Also, completed interviews of 63% in Phase 1 and 57% in Phase 2 raise questions about whether the positions of the significant number of incumbents who did not participate, for whatever reasons, were disadvantaged in some way. Given the importance of consistency and completeness, and even fairness of treatment, there is, therefore, probably some limitation to the full benefit of this additional information.\n[480] The process by which the Professional Team undertook the individual job evaluations was decidedly superior to that of the Commission in either its 1987 or 1991 evaluations. The Team operated as an entity, jointly reaching its decisions either unanimously or by consensus. This is the committee methodology recommended by evaluation experts, and follows the model presented in the Commission's booklet.\n[481] The Professional Team's process did, however, have a number of weaknesses. For example, only one of the three members had ever been in a Canada Post facility or was familiar with postal operations. It did not, of course, have representation from the relevant organizational levels of the employer. Given the circumstances of this particular case, the Team was operating as an outside contracted body, without any contact with the employer and little or no contact with its employees. It had little background or direct knowledge of the nature, history and dynamic of the organization involved, except what the third member, having some Canada Post experience, could provide.\n[482] The Professional Team's Audit Trail record led to difficulty in tracking precisely how Dr. Wolf and his colleagues had used the Hay Standard, and the rationale for their choices and evaluation ratings. In cross-examination, Dr. Wolf admitted that their Audit Trail did not reflect all their reasoning behind the ratings. He said it was \"rudimentary\" and \"a rough outline as opposed to detailed\". He went on to admit:\n...if you are suggesting we did a sloppy job of putting down an audit trail, I will concede that.145\n(v) The Professional Team's Position re: its 1993\/1994 Job Evaluations [483] Dr. Wolf acknowledged that he and his two colleagues found many shortcomings in the available job information and data. Indeed, as already noted, he went so far as to label the Job Fact Sheet, originally intended to be the primary source instrument for obtaining up-to-date information on both CR and PO positions, as \"abominable\".\n[484] With respect to his Team's job understanding based upon the materials before it, he testified as follows:\n...I would have to say, with the exception of the four jobs which we passed (sic), that our understanding was adequate but not necessarily ideal...146\n[485] What is the meaning of \"adequate\"? The Oxford Concise Dictionary defines \"adequate\" as \"sufficient, satisfactory; barely sufficient\". Webster's Dictionary defines it as \"enough for what is required; sufficient; suitable\". In turn, \"sufficient\" is defined by Oxford as \"sufficing, adequate, enough\" and by Webster as \"as much as is needed, enough, adequate\".\n[486] Based on these definitions, Dr. Wolf and his Team must have felt that the job information before them was enough for what they required to undertake the job evaluations. It was sufficient.\n[487] With respect to the Hay Standard, and how the Professional Team employed it in their evaluations, Dr. Wolf testified, as follows:\nQ. How does the standard here compare with commercial standards?\nA. As I think I have indicated, we took a more rigorous approach or more exacting than we would normally be. So it certainly at least meets, and in my opinion probably exceeds, the typical commercial standard, if you will, what consultants from Hay or other consulting firms are doing for their clients.147\n(vi) Canada Post's Position re: the Commission's 1991 and the Professional Team's 1993\/1994 Job Evaluations [488] Canada Post's stance on the reliability of the Professional Team's work is clear. It submitted that the job information and data are not sufficiently reliable to substantiate the Complaint, and, specifically, cannot be relied upon to determine whether or not there is a gender-based wage gap within the meaning of section 11 of the Act. Canada Post also takes the position that the Hay System is not appropriate for \"pay equity\" evaluations involving `blue collar' and clerical workers, and that the process undertaken by the Professional Team was faulty.\n[489] In support of its position, Canada Post called the following three expert witnesses, listed in order of their appearance before this Tribunal (the first two of whom provided testimony on both the Commission's 1991 evaluations and the Professional Team's 1993\/1994 evaluations):\nMs. Nadine Winter first appeared before the Tribunal in April 1996 as President of N. Winter Consulting Inc., a firm specializing in job evaluation, pay research and compensation management. Prior to establishing her own company in 1989, Ms. Winter was with Hay Management Consultants Canada Ltd. from 1982 to 1988. In her role as Director of Equal Employment Programs, she advised Hay consultants and clients and was involved in the modification of the Hay System to comply with requirements for gender neutrality. She identified one of her accomplishments as the implementation of the Hay System, in a \"pay equity\" context, in the Government of Manitoba. She became a partner with Hay Canada in 1987, with the title Director of Employment Equity Practices. She was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in job evaluation and compensation management, including consulting expertise in pay equity and equal pay for work of equal value. Mr. Norman D. Willis first appeared before the Tribunal in May 1996. At that time, he had been retired for two years. He started his job evaluation career with Hay & Associates in 1968, in the United States. By 1971, he had formed his own company, specializing in management training and human resources studies. He developed his own job evaluation plan, which was conceptually similar to the Hay System, in 1974. That plan has evolved since then, incorporating changes to meet client requirements. His initial focus was clients in the Seattle area. His first Canadian job evaluation proposal began with a presentation on equal pay to the Government of the Yukon in 1985. Subsequently, he handled job evaluation studies in Prince Edward Island, the Northwest Territories, Alberta and Manitoba. Willis & Associates was hired by the Joint Union-Management Initiative Committee (JUMI), a combined Canadian government and public service unions \"pay equity\" study, to assist the Committee in its work. Eventually, the Committee decided to use the Willis Evaluation Plan provided it could be changed to meet the criteria of the enabling legislation, the Canadian Human Rights Act, section 11. Those changes were made. Later, Mr. Willis attended as an expert witness before the Treasury Board tribunal which heard the union complaint, brought under section 11 after the JUMI Study had broken down. He was qualified as an expert in pay equity and in job evaluation by this Tribunal. Mr. P.G. Wallace first appeared before the Tribunal in June 2002. At that time, he was Senior Vice-President of Aon Consulting Inc., an organization offering consulting services on the management of compensation practices. He has had considerable experience in job evaluation and compensation design, having participated in the introduction of the Hay System at the Bank of Montreal in the 1970's. He also managed the Hay job evaluation process corporately for Shell Canada Ltd. and integrated it with Hay worldwide for the parent company, Royal Dutch Shell. In his current role, he consults with a wide range of companies in designing, implementing and administering various job evaluation programs. He was qualified by this Tribunal as an expert in job evaluation.\na) Ms. Winter's Testimony [490] After examining the Commission's 1991 job evaluation work, Ms. Winter reached a number of conclusions, the principal ones being the following:\nin adopting the Hay XYZ Plan, the Commission chose a method that fails to measure, accurately and completely, all aspects of the work found in clerical and blue collar positions (while also noting that neither the Alliance nor Canada Post had approved use of the Hay Plan); the majority of CR positions were evaluated individually by the raters and not as a committee; in the case of the 10 `generic' PO jobs, all but one were evaluated by at least two raters, resulting in a different rating process between the CR's and the PO's; the Commission's rater, who evaluated the largest number of CR positions, had no previous job evaluation experience; the Commission's raters, as a whole, had inadequate knowledge of the CR and PO positions; the data collection tools for the CR's and the PO's were incapable of collecting accurate, consistent and complete descriptions of the work concerned; in particular, the Job Fact Sheet could not generate accurate, consistent, and complete position information; CR employees were asked to evaluate their own positions rather than provide factual position information; instructions and guidelines presented to the respondents were inadequate and confusing; because the Job Fact Sheet was based on System One, information not relevant to that system was not collected; this meant that information in areas such as human relations skills and working conditions was lost; the intended purpose of the Interview Guide was unclear and there was apparently no common set of guidelines and definitions available to assist interviewers; the same deficiencies found in the Job Fact Sheet were replicated in the Interview Guide; several changes were made in the Interview Guide's design after the interview process had begun; sometimes, there were conflicts or differences within position descriptions but these were not clarified by the interviews; the PO position information collected was incomplete and did not reflect actual positions; the uniqueness and variations of individual positions was not recognized; job rotation requirements at the PO-4 level were not acknowledged; the `job specifications' for the PO group were a subjective compilation by one person, with no confirmation by employees or on-site observation; there is no indication that the 1991 CR and PO Benchmarks were representative of the full range of positions involved; the quality of the Benchmark information was seriously deficient; how the Benchmarks were used in guiding the evaluation of other positions seems to be unclear, even, according to his evidence, to the head investigator; the sample group of 93 CR positions and the 10 `generic' PO jobs do not make visible all the work of the total population of CR's and PO's; the Commission may have biased the evaluation process by initially evaluating CR positions in the order in which they were filed, by CR classification level; the Commission's Rationale Statements fail to provide adequate justification to explain and defend the ratings; the Commission failed to check, formally and systematically, the consistency and correctness of the evaluations; many of the formal `sore thumb' reviews, that are integral to the Hay System, do not appear to have been applied.\n[491] In summary, Ms. Winter concluded that \"the process to collect position information was seriously flawed...\" and that \"the Commission did not apply a disciplined, rigorous or defensible process to determine the value of the CR positions and PO jobs which they rated\".148\n[492] Ms. Winter's principal conclusions, arising from her examination of the job evaluation work of the Professional Team, included the following:\nshe expressed the same concern as she had expressed about the Commission's 1991 evaluations using the Hay Plan; she claimed that this plan fails to measure, accurately and completely, the work found in clerical and `blue collar' positions; the Professional Team did not follow the standard application of the Hay Guide Chart-Profile Method; it relied on job-to-job comparisons rather than on job-to-Guide Chart definition comparisons; by beginning to order positions according to their classification levels, and by the Commission's ratings, the Team may have biased the evaluation process altogether; a representative and consistent set of benchmark evaluations was not established at the start of the evaluation process; both Canadian and U.S. Hay job description standards for salary survey purposes were used in the evaluations, creating a consistency problem; Phase 1 positions were not used as formal Benchmarks, nor were they selected as reference positions in any rigorous and systematic manner; some positions, with few job characteristics in common with other positions or with deficient supporting documentation, were used as reference positions; all three evaluators lacked experience in evaluating `blue collar' and clerical positions with the Hay Guide Chart-Profile method; there were serious deficiencies with the position descriptions primarily in terms of age, accuracy and official status and the evaluators' knowledge of the positions was extremely limited; the Team failed to administer a disciplined, formal `sore thumb' review of evaluation results; several other issues were cited, including the time lapse between Phases 1 and 2 evaluations, the poor audit trail record and a flawed definition of `magnitude' in the Accountability factor.\n[493] In summary, Ms. Winter concluded that the Professional Team diverged significantly from the standard application of the Hay Guide Chart-Profile method of job evaluation and accepted significant deficiencies in position content. She also concluded that \"the quality of the position information for both the CR and PO positions was not adequate for evaluation purposes\".149\n[494] Ms. Winter also undertook a comparison of the Commission's (1991) and the Professional Team's (1993) CR evaluation rating results. Both sets of raters evaluated the same 93 CR positions with almost the same data and with essentially the same Hay Plan. Under these circumstances, Ms. Winter indicated that respective ratings should be very similar. If they are not, the results cannot be accepted as reliable.\n[495] Ms. Winter concluded that the hierarchies of value, reflected in the two sets of evaluation results \"...are clearly inconsistent with each other. Given the inconsistency in results, the Tribunal cannot rely on either set of rating results\". Apart from the different evaluation `discipline' adopted by the two groups of raters, she believed that there were three explanations for the number and size of the inconsistencies of the two results. First, the Hay method is not an appropriate tool to measure the value of CR and PO positions. Second, the application of the Hay method requires a consistent set of Benchmark evaluations to guide subsequent evaluations. No Benchmarks were used by the Professional Team and the ones used by the Commission were inadequate. Third, the lack of quality position information made it impossible to arrive at consistent and meaningful evaluation results.150\nb) Mr. Willis' Testimony [496] Mr. Willis summarized the conclusion of his examination of the Commission's 1991 evaluations, as follows:\nCompared to the disciplined approach required in the conduct of a sound Pay Equity study, the CHRC's effort was a poorly designed overall plan and a casually implemented process using data that could not form the basis of acceptable evaluations. It would not be possible to depend on the evaluations by this group for a viable Pay Equity result.151\n[497] More specifically, Mr. Willis concluded the following:\nthe Commission allowed the Alliance to `cherry pick' the male comparator jobs by not including in its investigation any jobs not mentioned in the Complaint; the GS and GL&T group of employees was ignored; the Hay Guide Chart-Profile system used should have been satisfactory as an evaluation instrument, provided the evaluators received adequate training; the Working Conditions factor which was apparently developed by Hay Canada provided for a wide range of points within each level or each sub-factor, thereby making it extremely difficult to evaluate consistently; there was evidence of mis-application of the Human Relations Skills sub-factor on a number of occasions; the evaluators discarded the Profile step (a means of checking the inter-factor relationships) in the evaluation process because the evaluators \"were getting some rather strange profiles\"152; the wording in the Accountability, Magnitude, and Impact sub-factors was arbitrarily changed by the evaluators during the evaluations, which could have modified ratings and caused inconsistency; Benchmark job evaluations are appropriate for this case but should be representative of the jobs within the total group being evaluated and commonly understood by the evaluators - this was not done by the Commission; the Benchmarks should have been evaluated by the full Committee and not by two evaluators, independently; the process of selecting position\/job samples fell short of meeting the stringent sampling requirement needed for a \"pay equity\" project; the sampled jobs should represent a full range of the depth and breadth of the organization; they did not in this case; additionally, the reduction of the 194 to 93 samples of CR's could not be considered sound or objective; the quality of job information utilized was unacceptable and could not be expected to produce a fair, equitable evaluation result; \"...the Job Fact Sheet was hopelessly inadequate for Pay Equity evaluation purposes\"; the job descriptions \"...were only of minimal usefulness ... in support of the Job Fact Sheet...\"; \"...a 14-page Interview Guide, incorporated into the information provided to evaluators was more of a liability than an asset...\"; the job data were collected at two different times, 1986 for the CR's and 1990\/91 for the PO's;153 while the PO `job specifications' came closer to providing factual job information, they were based on management and not employee-supplied data, and were acquired by a totally different process from that used for the CR's; the Commission's sore-thumbing step was not a proper one - it should be a tightly structured, group-led comparison of the evaluations concerned, sub-factor by sub-factor and factor point level by factor point level.\n[498] Mr. Willis summarized the conclusions of his examination of the Professional Team's 1993\/1994 evaluations as follows:\nthe Team \"...misused the Hay evaluation plan by employing it as a factor comparison system\"; the Team used essentially the same inadequate job content information as was used by the Commission evaluators; the Team was \"...ill-equipped to successfully complete their charge due to their lack of knowledge and backgrounds to undertake the assignment, and due to an approach to the evaluations that lacked the necessary discipline. The evaluation process utilized was unacceptable considering what is needed for a successful Pay Equity Study\".154\n[499] Mr. Willis' final statement was \"In my considered judgement, the efforts of the consultants retained by PSAC cannot be relied on for accurate Pay Equity evaluation results\".155\n[500] With more specificity, Mr. Willis concluded the following:\nhe disputed the wisdom of using the factor comparison approach for the Hay Plan in a \"pay equity\" case and favoured the point-factor method of the Hay Guide Chart-Profile approach to job value measurement; this preference was based on his opinion that the point-factor method is more suitable for evaluating a wide variety of jobs in a \"pay equity\" context; further, he was of the view that the factor comparison approach is more acceptable in a traditional single occupational group of jobs; the Professional Team had the same inadequate job information used by the Commission, including the Job Fact Sheet, Interview Guide, job descriptions, and `job specifications'; there were missing CR job descriptions and those of the PO's were \"unofficial\"; he agreed with Dr. Wolf's opinion that the telephone interviews conducted by the Professional Team, \"...with one or two exceptions, outside of the working conditions arena ... did not add anything significant\"156; knowledge of each job's classification level was available to the three Team members and this knowledge could have affected their perception of the jobs and, consequently, their evaluations; use of the \"black box analysis\" approach to job evaluation could not be expected to provide a useful assessment of what was contained within the black box, given the poor quality of job information input; it was a \"highly questionable practice\" to use the Hay U.S. job description standard, particularly for a \"pay equity\" case, as this standard was intended for survey comparisons and it cannot be assumed that U.S. and Canadian job titles, even if the same or similar, are the same in job content.\nc) Mr. Wallace's Testimony [501] Mr. Wallace indicated that his firm had been asked by Canada Post to review and comment on the process undertaken by the Professional Team in 2000 in addressing the possible impact on its 1993\/1994 evaluations, of the considerable additional evidence that had arisen from a number of Canada Post witnesses. Mr. Wallace stated that he used what he termed \"...standard criteria against which job evaluation exercises within companies are measured\".157 What he wanted to know was if the Team's job evaluation results were accurate, consistent, and credible.\n[502] Mr. Wallace further indicated that \"in conducting this review the goal is to determine whether or not the process and discipline employed by the Committee [Professional Team] was capable of yielding results meeting these criteria\".158\n[503] The principal conclusions reached by Mr. Wallace included the following:\nthe processes followed and particular actions taken by the Professional Team fell short of many of what he considered to be industry standard practices for the evaluation of jobs, having the effect of significantly compromising the accuracy, consistency and credibility of the results; \"the lack of complete and consistent documentation on what is being measured by the job evaluation process ... and the failure of the Committee [Professional Team] to apply the safeguards of the Hay system, directly affects the consistency of the evaluation results\"159; the lack of discipline and rigour in the Professional Team's process should call into question the credibility of the evaluation results.\n[504] More particularly, Mr. Wallace concluded the following:\nthe Hay Guide Chart-Profile method, while an excellent job evaluation tool, was inappropriate for clerical and production\/operations jobs; the Hay factor comparison approach is dated and not in keeping with either Hay training materials or Mr. Wallace's 30 years of experience with the Hay method; the factor comparison approach is best suited for jobs that are similar in nature; \"it is difficult to impossible to create an accurate ranking of dissimilar jobs through total reliance upon the factor comparison methodology without linking the evaluations to the guide charts\"160; the Professional Team, while including recognized experts in the use of Hay methodology, had limited experience in postal operations; the potential for bias was high, given the Team was mandated by two of the parties in the case; while the Professional Team met for five days to deliberate over the impact of the additional evidence on its original evaluations, there was no apparent structure to the process followed; Dr. Wolf had no notes with him from his review of the material and no summary or analysis of the job data they had been considering; the initial screening of the additional material by a single member of the Team, Dr. Wolf, raises questions, particularly given the absence of documentation of what items were considered irrelevant or inappropriate; nor is there any documentation of the selected additional testimony; the job descriptions were incomplete and inconsistent and the additional information provided was not analyzed and documented appropriately; it is essential that an evaluating group be entirely satisfied with its job descriptions; Mr. Wallace disagreed with the Professional Team's decision \"...to evaluate PO jobs only if they determined there was a just noticeable difference between their recollection of their original job understanding and their new job understanding\"161; the Team should have justified its \"just noticeable difference\" judgement by use of the Hay Guide Charts and re-evaluated each job incorporating all the additional data; the weakness of the Audit Trail of the 1993\/1994 evaluation process compromised the process of 2000 as there was no record of solid evaluations in the earlier period that could have served as reference positions for the 2000 evaluations, or of earlier controversial decisions that might have been altered by the additional material.\n(vii) The Alliance's Position h3:\na) Ms. Winter's Testimony [505] The Alliance's submissions focus on three features relating to Ms. Winter and her evidence, as follows:\nher knowledge of Hay, and the Hay Job Evaluation Plan, her credibility, her Reports (Exhibits R-235, R-249, R-253, R-254 and R-278).\n[506] It is the Alliance's submission that, as the cornerstone of Canada Post's attack on the Commission's investigation and evaluations, and on the Professional Team's evaluations, Ms. Winter's evidence fails to meet the requirements demanded of an expert witness and was so lacking in credibility that it should be given no weight.\n[507] Ms. Winter joined the Hay organization in 1982 and began practical training as a job evaluation consultant in 1985, but did not regard herself as a full-fledged Hay evaluation consultant until early 1986. She was involved in the practice of job evaluation for some 2\u00bd years while assuming other Hay responsibilities not directly related to job evaluation. Canada Post did not seek to qualify her as an expert in the Hay System of job evaluation.\n[508] The Alliance cites Ms. Winter's involvement, while still with the Hay Canada Company, in a legal action which Hay had brought against Norman Willis for what she termed a \"violation of intellectual property laws\". There were a series of mis-statements and revisions made by Ms. Winter as she gave evidence on this issue. The Alliance argued that these resulted from her desire to avoid acknowledging the strong and obvious similarities between the Willis and the Hay job evaluation plans. Given that the Willis Plan had been used, successfully, in several \"pay equity\" applications, including clerical and `blue collar' work, the Alliance asserted that Ms. Winter was attempting to mislead the Tribunal regarding those similarities.\n[509] The Alliance questioned Ms. Winter's credibility further, citing her failure to refer the Tribunal to the post JUMI tribunal decision (the Treasury Board case) which contradicted her opinion concerning the standard of reliability required for job information.162 She had called for a standard of correctness, as was demanded by her interpretation of the Ontario Haldimand-Norfolk decision.163 The Treasury Board tribunal decision was based on a standard of reasonableness. She claimed, when being cross-examined on this point, that she did not know what \"reasonableness\" meant in the context of \"pay equity\" evaluations.\n[510] Additional instances of Ms. Winter's lack of credibility were cited by the Alliance, as follows:\nshe omitted key material when giving her opinion concerning the quality of job information; she had a tendency to highlight the negative, and to ignore the positive when giving her opinions, rather than answering questions directly; her responses to questions posed were often inclined to be argumentative; as her evidence continued for many days, her inclination to revise points made on the previous day, often at considerable length, became more and more evident.\n[511] In summary, the Alliance argued that, when viewed as a whole, Ms. Winter's expert evidence was biased towards the Respondent's position, and fell far short of meeting the standards, including independence, required of a credible expert witness. Therefore, the Alliance argued, Ms. Winter's evidence should be given no weight.\n[512] Most particularly, the Alliance's submissions concerning Ms. Winter's expert evidence focus on her opinion about the job data collection tools, the process and quality of the position information, and the Professional Team's job evaluation process. This opinion was presented in her viva voce evidence, and in Chapters 4 and 6 of her Reports (Exhibits R-235 and R-249).\n[513] Ms. Winter's Report contends that the \"quality of the position information for both the CR and the PO positions was not adequate for evaluation purposes\".164 She illustrated her contention by examining two CR positions which served as Benchmarks. After having reviewed all the pertinent documentation concerning these positions, she held that she had had difficulty understanding what the jobs were all about. One job, in particular, gave her great difficulty. In cross-examination of Ms. Winter, the Alliance demonstrated that the relevant supervisor for this job had identified another position that was essentially identical. Ms. Winter had used, as an example of a Benchmark which had such poor documentation that she could not understand what it was all about, the Benchmark position which referenced the nearly identical position. Ms. Winter, had, however, failed to refer to that nearly identical position. Had she done so, she would have enlightened her understanding of what she considered to be a difficult Benchmark position; the Professional Team had readily recognized the cross-over between the two positions.\n[514] In the opinion of the Alliance, Ms. Winter's evidence, in cross-examination, concerning her position as co-chair of the Hay Job Evaluation Process in the Manitoba Pay Equity Study illustrated her ability to integrate information found in different incumbent responses in order to obtain acceptable job understanding. This ability stands in sharp contrast, argued the Alliance, to Ms. Winter's approach to job understanding in the Complaint before this Tribunal. She often offered her opinions in isolation, and made little or no effort to integrate information available to her from several arenas.\n[515] Further examples of categorical or exaggerated opinions presented in her Reports, and in examination-in-chief, which were moderated in cross-examination, were cited by the Alliance.\n[516] Notwithstanding modifications and explanations made during cross-examination, Ms. Winter stood by her reported conclusions. More particularly, she stated that the Professional Team's evaluation results \"cannot be considered reliable, accurate or reflective of the work performed\" because the job information used was significantly deficient and the Professional Team's evaluation process deviated significantly from the \"standard\" application of Hay as she understood it.165\n[517] This latter opinion was based on Ms. Winter's refusal to acknowledge that Hay could be applied, reliably, by means of a factor comparison approach, as was used by the Professional Team. The Alliance argued that this opinion should be rejected by the Tribunal based upon the opposite but more credible opinion of Dr. Martin Wolf, the only witness to be qualified as an expert in the use of the Hay Plan. The fact that Ms. Winter did not evaluate either the CR positions or the PO positions, using any job evaluation plan, underlined the theoretical nature of her opinion. Based, as it was, on theory which had been modified during her cross-examination, the Alliance submitted that Ms. Winter's opinion concerning the Professional Team's factor comparison approach to the Hay Evaluation Plan should be rejected.\n[518] In the portion of her Report (R-254) concerning the wage adjustment methodologies which the Commission and the Alliance had used, Ms. Winter stressed her belief that gender identification, valuing of work and any wage adjustment should take place at the level of the job itself rather than at the broader grouping and level in which the jobs are found. She conceded, in cross-examination, that the Treasury Board tribunal decision adopted the identification of gender at the level of the group rather than in the individual job.\n[519] Ms. Winter made reference to particular provisions of various provincial \"pay equity\" acts but made virtually no references to the Canadian Human Rights Act. She also failed to address sections 12 and 13 of the 1986 Equal Wage Guidelines, although she was criticizing the Commission and the Alliance for complying with these sections of the Guidelines.\n[520] The Commission and the Alliance approach, calculating an average Hay score for each CR level and a wage gap based on that average value, was, in the opinion of Ms Winter, flawed. This approach, however, has been used elsewhere, including the Treasury Board tribunal decision.\n[521] Ms. Winter also argued that each female-dominant CR position should be evaluated. She did not alter her opinion when, in cross-examination, it was pointed out to her that the Treasury Board tribunal decision had endorsed a sampling of the CR population.\n[522] Ms. Winter was critical of the make-up of the male comparator group, comprising PO-INT and PO-EXT sub-groups. She made particular reference to Ontario's Pay Equity Act and its requirement to seek a comparator within the complainant group.166 She also referred to other provincial jurisdictions that require the negotiation of comparator groups. In cross-examination, she admitted that these provincial provisions are not required under the federal legislation.\n[523] To summarize, the Alliance submitted that the Tribunal ought to draw a negative inference from Ms. Winter's Reports based on her failure to address the relevance of federal tribunal decisions, the Act and its Guidelines, all of which do not support her version of \"pay equity\". Her opinions were based almost solely on portions of provincial legislation.167\n[524] Ms. Winter returned to present R-278, a Report which was to address the implications of newly-found CR job information. Her conclusion in that Report was a reiteration of her opinion that the job data used by all evaluators were inadequate. The Alliance submitted, in its argument, that Ms. Winter simply used this new Report as a pretext to revisit her earlier criticisms, while she continued to act as an advocate for the Respondent.\nb) Mr. Willis' Testimony [525] The Alliance's submissions focus on three features relating to Mr. Willis and his evidence, as follows:\nhis knowledge of Hay Job Evaluation, his credibility, his criticisms of the Professional Team's process, the job information that process used, and their approach to Hay, all as expressed in his Report (Exhibit R-455).\n[526] While qualified as an expert in job evaluation and \"pay equity\" by this Tribunal, Mr. Willis was not qualified as an expert in the Hay method of job evaluation. He had only three years of direct experience in applying that method during his employment with the Hay organization from 1968 to 1971. He maintained links with a number of Hay installations after his departure from Hay.\n[527] The Alliance questioned the credibility of Mr. Willis. Its argument found a basis in a statement made by the Chair (now resigned) of this Tribunal during an earlier appearance by Mr. Willis. At that time, the Chair expressed reservations about Mr. Willis' expert opinion, given that he had not examined the relevant evaluations and supporting material before giving his opinion.\n[528] The Alliance submitted that Mr. Willis' Report, was prepared in a similar manner, without the proper foundation necessary to give an expert opinion. Mr. Willis admitted, when cross-examined about his Report that he had not read all the documentation sent to him by the Respondent. He had been asked, however, to prepare an expert's view on that documentation. Notwithstanding this admission, his Report, and his evidence concerning that Report, did not indicate that his opinions were based only on a partial review of the materials sent. Therefore, the Alliance submitted that his opinion should not be accepted as wholly credible.\n[529] The Alliance also pointed to a number of occasions when Mr. Willis, in evidence-in- chief, \"insisted vehemently that he believed statements made by Dr. Wolf, in sworn testimony, to be fallacious\". Such statements of opinion, argued the Alliance, \"raise significant concerns regarding Mr. Willis' credibility as an objective and professional expert witness\".168\n[530] An inability to make even a slight concession to cross-examining counsel was also cited as an example of an expert witness who was intransigent and defensive of his position. In other words, Mr. Willis' expert opinions should be rejected as the opinions of someone who lacked the independent, professional approach, required of a credible expert witness.\n[531] The Alliance also challenged Mr. Willis' opinions, based on his lack of experience with a \"pay equity\" process which was taking place in an atmosphere of litigation rather than in a cooperative union-management atmosphere. Mr. Willis' \"pay equity\" experience had always been, according to his evidence, with the latter type of work where he acted as a facilitator who had the full support of employer management in undertaking the job evaluation studies and the gathering of job information upon which those evaluations would be made. He was, according to the Alliance, either unable, or refused, to comprehend the nature and context of the Complaint before the Tribunal. Indeed, Mr. Willis made one concession during cross-examination. He indicated that the process which he advocated in his Report and during his evidence-in-chief, would, except for the choice of the evaluation plan, be impossible without the full co-operation of the employer.\n[532] Based on that concession, the Alliance submitted that to accept Mr. Willis' Report and evidence would be to place the standard necessary for the successful presentation of a prima facie case by a complainant in any \"pay equity\" complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act so high that a refusal by the employer to co-operate would always result in the failure of the complaint.\nc) Mr. Wallace's Testimony [533] The Alliance's submissions focus on three features relating to Mr. Wallace and his testimony, as follows:\nhis knowledge of Hay Job Evaluation, his credibility, his Report (Exhibit R-615).\n[534] While qualified as an expert in job evaluation by this Tribunal, Mr. Wallace was not qualified as an expert in Hay job evaluation. He did, however, have considerable experience with the use of Hay as a client working under the direction of a Hay consultant. He had never worked for Hay in any capacity, nor had he ever been qualified as an expert in Hay before this Tribunal or any other tribunal or court.\n[535] The Alliance was of the view that Mr. Wallace's credibility was put in doubt when he criticized the job understanding of Dr. Wolf and his colleagues, having read only a fraction of the material read, analyzed and evaluated by the Professional Team. Mr. Wallace admitted that he had not been provided with, and did not seek access to, certain original job documentation that had been available to the Professional Team. In fact, Mr. Wallace conceded, in cross-examination, that the Professional Team had a better understanding of the jobs concerned than he had.\n[536] The Alliance also submitted that Mr. Wallace tended to highlight the negative and to ignore the positive in the Professional Team's Reports, and in Dr. Wolf's testimony.\n[537] Mr. Wallace's Report must, according to the Alliance's submissions, be read in context. That context is that he did not have access to much of the material upon which the Professional Team had relied to make its evaluations.\n[538] His Report is a critique of the Professional Team's methodology, process, and the job information used in its evaluations. It stresses that job evaluations, especially for \"pay equity\" purposes, must be done at a standard used in industrial practice. This is Mr. Wallace's usual methodology. This simply underlines his familiarity with employer-supported studies, and his lack of familiarity with a process taking place in a litigious arena.\n[539] The Alliance submitted that \"the most significant criticism that Mr. Wallace brought against the Hay Plan was found in his explanation of Appendix `A' to his Report, which shows a weak correlation between Hay points and money paid to CR's. Mr. Wallace admitted, in cross-examination, that he had not considered whether this wage gap for women performing work which appeared to have equal value with men could have been caused by a \"pay equity\" problem.169\n[540] According to the Alliance, Mr. Wallace's criticisms of the process followed by the Professional Team, compared with the one he proposed, reveal an essential difference in approach. The Professional Team began their 2000 process with the assumption that their earlier evaluations were `correct' and would only change if the additional and new material altered their previous understanding of each job. Mr. Wallace's proposed process was an internal, non-litigious, job evaluation appeal process. This is unlike the process necessitated by the facts of this case.\n[541] In sum, the Alliance submitted the following, concerning Mr. Wallace's evidence:\nMr. Wallace's Report and testimony must be read and appreciated in light of the acknowledged fact that he did not have access to much of the material read, analyzed and evaluated by the Professional Team; Mr. Wallace failed to appreciate the fundamental difference between the complaint before the Tribunal, a complaint which was litigious almost from the beginning, and the employer-managed \"pay equity\" job evaluation process with which he was familiar; Mr. Wallace acknowledged that the Professional Team had a greater understanding of the jobs and positions being evaluated than he did at the time he constructed his Report, and gave his evidence.\n(viii) The Commission's Position re: Canada Post's Expert Witnesses - Ms. Winter, Messrs. Willis and Wallace [542] The Commission first noted that none of the three experts presented by Canada Post had actually worked with any of the job data which they found to be unacceptable. Secondly, their opinions were all based on incomplete information. Either the materials provided to them by Canada Post were incomplete, or the witness had not read all the material presented to him\/her as the basis for the expert's report requested.\n[543] Only the Professional Team had reviewed all of the job information, including that led by Canada Post in its defence. The Commission submitted that the two weaknesses noted are sufficient for this Tribunal to discount the evidence of all three experts presented by Canada Post to report on the evaluation process, the evaluation methodology chosen, and the job information used.\n[544] The Commission re-iterated the submission that Ms. Winter's Report wrongly relied on a standard of `correctness' rather than the standard of reasonableness to criticize the collection of job data, and the job information used by the Professional Team during its evaluation process. In her Report, Ms. Winter had noted that the decision of the Ontario \"pay equity\" tribunal in a complaint involving a Haldimand-Norfolk hospital had concluded that the standard to be applied was that of correctness, and she indicated in her viva voce evidence the following:\nQ. ...indicate that a standard of correctness was applied by the Ontario pay equity hearings tribunal in the Haldimand-Norfolk case. Now, ... I take it that you adopt that standard or that you have adopted that standard in your report?\nA. Of correctness, yes.170\n[545] Indeed, Ms. Winter went on to indicate that she did not know what was meant by `reasonableness'.\n[546] The Commission argued that this reliance on the standard of correctness as a foundation for the expert opinion presented in her Report and in her evidence before the Tribunal should be reason for the Tribunal to discount her evidence. This reliance on a standard of correctness is, according to the Commission, merely an example of the tendency of Ms. Winter to define \"pay equity\" principles rigidly. Her rigidity was noted, adversely, by the Ontario Court (General Division) in the Service Employees International Union case, where the Court preferred the expert evidence of Dr. Pat Armstrong compared to that of Ms. Winter.171\n[547] The Commission submitted that rigid principles are inconsistent with a standard of reasonableness. Indeed, the Commission contends that Ms. Winter herself did not apply the exacting standard of correctness to job information available to the Manitoba Pay Equity Study, for which she was jointly responsible during her days with the Hay organization. In fact, she indicated in evidence that it was necessary, in that case, to \"work with\" the Manitoba job information. This attitude is analogous to the evidence of Dr. Wolf that the Professional Team had to \"work with\" the job data which was available to them.\n[548] Ms. Winter's own admission of a less than rigid approach to job information during her work with the Manitoba Pay Equity Study is in sharp contrast to her unrelenting criticism of most, if not all, of the job documentation in this case, and her condemnation of the approach taken by the Professional Team to the job documentation. Accordingly, the Commission submitted that Ms. Winter lacks credibility as an expert giving an opinion concerning the job information upon which the Professional Team founded its evaluation process.\n[549] The Commission submitted that Mr. Willis' expert opinion concerning the job information and the evaluation methodology and process should also be given less weight than that of the expert opinion of Dr. Wolf. It bases this submission upon its indication to the Tribunal that Mr. Willis was unclear, even ambiguous and evasive, about how long he had taken to review the job documentation materials presented to him by Canada Post to be a basis for his expert opinion.\n[550] Additionally, Mr. Willis' experience in \"pay equity\" evaluation processes was largely based on joint studies in which job data was generated with the agreement of all parties involved. Although he was, as the facilitator in the study which used his `Willis Plan' as the basis for its process, qualified as an expert witness in the Treasury Board case, that complaint involved primarily the issue of the reliability of the methodology chosen to deal with the joint union-management \"pay equity\" study and evaluation process.\n[551] According to the Commission, Mr. Wallace's critical opinion of the job information should be largely discounted because he did not, nor was he asked by Canada Post, to review most of the job documentation. His review was largely limited to an examination of the Professional Team's consideration, in 2000, of the additional evidence provided by Canada Post's many defence witnesses. Additionally, he was provided with portions of data contained in the transcripts of Dr. Wolf's cross-examination. Therefore, the Commission submits that Mr. Wallace's view of the job information is \"only through the eyes of Canada Post\" and his opinions are not independent of his client.\nH. Reliability of Methodology Used by the Professional Team: - Tribunal's Analysis (i) Introduction [552] Human rights legislation demands constant attention to the purposive interpretation of the statute involved. In a recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal concerning the interpretation of \"establishment\", Evans, J.A. stressed this need, as follows:\nAny analysis of a statutory human rights issue must be undertaken with a view to the purposes of the legislative scheme and of the policy objectives of the particular provisions in dispute. A search for the meaning of human rights legislation, including subordinate legislation, must both start with, and be informed throughout by, its essential objective.172\n[553] As suggested in paragraph [412], the Tribunal accepts that the standard that ought to apply in \"pay equity\" complaints brought under section 11 of the Act, such as that before this Tribunal, is the standard of `reasonableness' in determining the reliability of the job evaluation system chosen, the process followed, and the job information used.\n[554] The Tribunal rejects the submissions of Canada Post that a rigid standard of `correctness' is necessary for the purposes of a \"pay equity\" process. Rather, the Tribunal finds that the standard of `reasonableness' accepted by the tribunal in the Treasury Board case is more conducive to the interpretation of human rights legislation, and section 11 of the Act in particular. In the case before this Tribunal, the evidence of most experts, including those of Canada Post, presented the concept of job evaluation as \"more an art than a science\". Therefore, any standard which could not accommodate this concept should be rejected.\n[555] Each of the elements necessary in testing reasonable reliability should be examined. In other words, the job evaluation system chosen should be reasonably reliable, the process and methodology used in evaluating the relevant jobs\/positions should be reasonably reliable, and the job information and its sources should be reasonably reliable. The findings of the Tribunal should be based on the civil standard of a balance of probabilities.\n[556] In this regard, the Tribunal has already noted the importance of examining the evidence provided by a number of expert witnesses in a systematic manner. The components of the systematic model employed by the Tribunal were identified in paragraph [419].\n[557] The first several components of the model have already been addressed. The Tribunal has noted the party who called each expert witness, the expert's field of expertise, and each expert's mandate and conclusions reached. The expert witnesses have been identified as Dr. Wolf, Ms. Winter, Mr. Willis, Mr. Wallace, Dr. Bellhouse, and Dr. Kervin.\n[558] While the first several components of the systematic model receive further attention in this analysis, they are examined, as appropriate, in the context of the remaining components of the model. In other words, the Tribunal will comment on the extent of each expert's knowledge, experience and standing in his\/her field of expertise, and how each expert fulfilled his\/her mandate and presented his\/her conclusions to the Tribunal.\n(ii) The Job Evaluation System Chosen [559] The job evaluation system used by the Professional Team was the factor comparison approach to the Hay Plan. Canada Post, based upon the opinion of each of its three expert witnesses, submitted that the Professional Team's decision to employ this model of Hay was questionable. Indeed, Canada Post submitted that the use of the Hay Plan itself was not appropriate to a process which would evaluate, for \"equal pay\" purposes, diverse jobs in the clerical and operations spheres of the corporation.\n[560] Although Mr. Willis, an expert witness for Canada Post, acknowledged that the Hay Plan, especially in its Guide Chart-Profile application, is a satisfactory job evaluation instrument provided the evaluators receive adequate training, his opinion was that the Professional Team \"mis-used\" the Hay Plan by engaging it in its factor comparison mode. Mr. Wallace, another expert witness for Canada Post, also contended that the Hay Guide Chart-Profile method was an acceptable job evaluation tool but regarded it as inappropriate for clerical and production\/operations jobs. Mr. Wallace further felt the factor comparison method was long out-of-date. An additional Canada Post expert witness, Ms. Winter, condemned the Hay Plan, generally, for not being suitable to evaluate work of a clerical or \"blue collar\" nature.\n[561] Notwithstanding the opinions of both Mr. Willis and Mr. Wallace concerning the generally satisfactory nature of the Hay Plan as a job evaluation instrument, Canada Post's submissions faulted its use in evaluating clerical and `blue collar' work. In particular, counsel for the Corporation argued that Hay \"under-weights\" the working conditions factor, which, in turn, leads to under-valuing of elements important to clerical and `blue collar' types of positions.\n[562] Mr. Willis' opinion was qualified by his observation that the factor-comparison approach to the Hay Plan might be acceptable for use when it is applied to a single occupational group of jobs. In a \"pay equity\" case, involving a wide variety of male-dominant and female-dominant jobs, however, he believed that the \"point-factor\" approach to the Hay Plan was more appropriate. Indeed, Dr. Wolf had agreed, in cross-examination, that, although the factor comparison approach to Hay can be, and is, used with dissimilar jobs, it is easier to apply, and perhaps works better, with jobs of a similar nature.173\n[563] Dr. Wolf indicated that it was the opinion of the Professional Team that the Hay Plan was quite able to accommodate clerical and `blue collar' jobs, particularly with the strengthened working conditions factor. This would be especially true when it was being applied by evaluators who had experience with the Hay methods. The Commission, in undertaking its 1991 evaluations, had also felt that the Hay Plan was capable of measuring `blue collar' and office-environment jobs.\n[564] In this case, the Professional Team which evaluated the sample CR positions, and the `generic' PO jobs was composed of two members who were former Hay associates, with many, many years of experience in working with Hay and other clients. The Tribunal finds that Dr. Wolf was the only expert witness who was sufficiently qualified to assess the validity and reliability of the Hay Plan generally, and the factor comparison approach, in particular, vis-\u00e0-vis the requirements of this Complaint. Although he did not appear as an expert witness, Dr. Ingster, the first member of the Professional Team to be approached by the Alliance, confirmed, in letters presented as exhibits in this Complaint, the acceptability of the Hay Plan for use with the materials presented to the Team for evaluation.\n[565] The Tribunal notes the Professional Team's statement, included in its Report, entered as PSAC-29, that its mandate was \"that the Hay method was to be applied to the job content in accordance with the `best practices' of senior level Hay consultants considered to be expert in the use of the Guide Chart-Profile process\". The request had been presented to Dr. Ingster when he was approached by the Alliance to participate in the evaluation process. The expert opinion, expressed by Dr. Wolf in his viva voce evidence concerning the Report of the Professional Team, reinforced the Team's conclusion that the mandate had been followed diligently.\n[566] While all three of the expert witnesses called by Canada Post had some experience in working with the Hay Plan, the Tribunal finds that only Dr. Wolf demonstrated that he had the in-depth historical knowledge of how the Hay Plan's original design and use had evolved, in its various configurations, over its many years of application. He testified that he had spent thirty years in job evaluation including about twenty years dealing with the Hay methodology. As observed earlier in this Decision, he estimated that he had evaluated upwards of 10,000 jobs using the Hay process, including office clerical and payroll systems jobs, and in his early days, even `blue collar' jobs. Moreover, when employed with the Hay organization, he had served as a \"correlator\" or \"keeper of the flame\" in the role of maintaining the integrity of the Hay system.\n[567] Additionally, the Team included Dr. Ingster, the person with whom the Alliance spoke first, and who had received the original Alliance mandate. Dr. Ingster spent an early part of his career with the Hay organization and later had an independent affiliation with Hay while working with a wide-range of clients.\n[568] Accordingly, the Tribunal gives significant weight to the ability of Dr. Wolf and his colleague, Dr. Ingster, to choose, under the unusual circumstances of this case, the most suitable configuration of the Hay Plan for use in the evaluation of the jobs\/positions involved.\n[569] In contrast, the Tribunal finds that the expert opinion of Ms. Winter, in categorically dismissing the Hay Plan, was presented in a rigid and immoveable fashion, leaving the impression of being a witness who was espousing the position of her client rather than being an independent expert who was attempting to help the Tribunal understand difficult concepts outside its realm of expertise.\n[570] The evidence of Mr. Willis, while not supportive of the factor-comparison approach, did not dismiss the Hay Plan as such for job evaluation in a \"pay equity\" context. Nor did the evidence of Mr. Wallace. He stated, on page 2 of his Report, that the Hay Guide Chart-Profile method was \"...an excellent job evaluation tool...\", but he considered it inappropriate for use with \"...clerical and production\/operations jobs\".174\n[571] Therefore, the Tribunal finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Hay Plan, whether using the factor comparison method or other approaches, is, in the hands of competent evaluators as were the members of the Professional Team, a suitable overall job evaluation scheme which will address the issues of this \"pay equity\" Complaint in a reasonably reliable manner.\n(iii) The Process [572] The Tribunal must answer the following question:\nIs it more likely than not that the process followed by the Professional Team in undertaking its evaluations of the complainant and the comparator positions and jobs, in this case, was a reasonably reliable one?\n[573] As noted earlier in this Decision, the Professional Team, having been engaged by the Alliance, undertook its evaluations as an entity, jointly reaching its decisions either unanimously or by consensus. This is, according to all of the expert evidence before the Tribunal, in line with what most experts in the field recommend. It is also in accord with the Commission's own model. The size of the Team was smaller and its make-up quite different from what one would normally expect. Usually an evaluation committee would be internal to the organization involved in the \"pay equity\" process. There might be external advisory or facilitation assistance. In this case, however, the situation which set the Professional Team in motion was far from normal.\n[574] The existence of the Professional Team was somewhat unique in the field of \"pay equity\" job evaluation undertakings. The process by which the Professional Team evaluations were completed was equally unique, as there was no direct involvement from the employer or employees as part of the evaluation committee. Obviously, this was not a standard approach to \"pay equity\" job evaluation. Given the litigious setting, however, this was a process chosen to evaluate the complainant positions and the 10 `generic' PO jobs using a \"rigorous application of the Hay Guide Chart-Profile Method of job evaluation...\".175\n[575] Canada Post submitted that neither Dr. Wolf nor Dr. Ingster had experience with Canadian postal operations. Indeed, Dr. Wolf admitted in cross-examination that he had never been inside a Canadian post office facility. Although the third member of the Team, Judith Davidson-Palmer, had been an administrative management-level employee of Canada Post, she had little experience with the Hay Plan.\n[576] In addition to Canada Post's concerns regarding the make-up of the Professional Team, it submitted that there was a dearth of written records of exactly how the Team had conducted its work. The \"audit trail\", usually a vital part of any evaluation process, was weak at best, leaving little documentation to support the Team's conclusions.\n[577] Canada Post's three witnesses with experience in job evaluation processes denigrated the work of the Professional Team. Ms. Winter noted that the Team members lacked experience in dealing with clerical and `blue collar' work, and she was of the opinion that they ran an undisciplined `sore thumb' review of evaluation results. She faulted the Team for not establishing a representative and consistent set of Benchmark evaluations at the start of the evaluation process. Furthermore, Ms. Winter believed that the Team's initial ordering of positions by classification levels and by the Commission's evaluation ratings may have biased the overall process.\n[578] Mr. Willis expressed his opinion that the Team lacked a certain discipline in its deliberations. For example, he felt that the \"sore thumb\" step should have been more tightly structured. Additionally, he was opposed to the `black box' techniques that Dr. Wolf had used in the evaluation process, techniques drawn from his background in engineering. Mr. Willis also criticized the Team's use of the U.S. Hay job description standard.\n[579] Mr. Wallace noted that two members of the Team, while being recognized as experts, lacked postal operations experience. He also commented unfavourably on what he regarded as the Team's lack of discipline and rigour in the evaluation process, including the obvious weakness of the \"audit trail\".\n[580] The Tribunal notes that the Professional Team had to tackle its assignment in a rather unusual manner. It had, over a relatively short period of time, to sift through literally thousands of pages of documentation and exhibits compiled by others. The evidence indicates that the Team members were not able to adhere to the exact discipline and rigour which would normally be expected in a joint union-management process, where the job evaluation committee would be composed of administrative staff members as well as other employees. The difficulty of evaluating in such a setting was largely off-set, however, by the particular competence of the three-member committee. Two of the members had many years of experience in evaluating jobs using the Hay Plan and other systems. The third member of the Professional Team had been a Canada Post employee, working in management and organization development. Working together, they believed they were able to complete the task assigned. Their Report and Dr. Wolf's viva voce evidence indicated that the Team considered that the process by which it conducted its evaluations, although unconventional, was done with reasonable diligence and discipline.\n[581] The Tribunal accepts this opinion, and finds that the process, operating in the context of a unique litigious situation, and with an approach dependent upon the competence and experience of the small Professional Team, was reasonably reliable. Inevitably, it was not the superior process which might have resulted had the parties been working in the more usual, co-operative manner. It was, however, in the view of the Tribunal, a reasonably reliable process, given the circumstances under which it was accomplished.\n[582] This acceptance of the opinion of the Professional Team, and that of Dr. Wolf, in particular, that their evaluation process was reasonably reliable is based upon the Tribunal's finding that the expert evidence of Dr. Wolf is more credible than that proffered by Canada Post's experts, Ms. Winter, Mr. Willis, and Mr. Wallace. Dr. Wolf was present during the process of job evaluation, and participated as a member of the Team. His evidence was factual as well as that of an expert.\n[583] In giving more weight to Dr. Wolf's evidence, the Tribunal has already acknowledged that the process followed by the Professional Team was by no means of the highest level.\n[584] The weight, if any, which the Tribunal has given to the expert evidence presented by Canada Post, however, has not been sufficient to overcome the opinion of Dr. Wolf that the Professional Team participated in a reasonably reliable evaluation process.\n[585] Ms. Winter, a self-made businesswoman and President of her own consulting company, had spent several successful years as an employee of Hay Canada, attaining the rank of Sr. Vice-President and Partner. A sometimes argumentative witness, her opinions in both her viva voce evidence and in her Reports, displayed a tendency to rigidity and a requirement for absoluteness when measuring reliability.\n[586] Mr. Willis began his job evaluation career with the Hay organization in the United States and formed his own consulting company in 1971. Having developed his own job evaluation plan in 1974, he had handled many job evaluation studies in both the U.S. and in Canada. He provided advice to the JUMI Study Committee that preceded the Treasury Board case. That Committee used the Willis Plan in its job evaluations.\n[587] Mr. Willis indicated in evidence that he was accustomed to working in a non-litigious and co-operative setting. Although his Report did not so indicate, his viva voce evidence confirmed that he had not read all of the fairly detailed material sent to him by Canada Post. His responses given in cross-examination were somewhat evasive about the amount of time he had spent on the work he was requested to do by Canada Post. While obviously a successful, now-retired consultant, having run his own firm for some 25 years, his manner before the Tribunal was, at times, rather curt.\n[588] Mr. Wallace began his considerable experience in job evaluation when he participated in the introduction of the Hay system at the Bank of Montreal in the 1970's. He went on to manage the Hay process for Shell Canada and integrated it with Hay world-wide for the parent company, Royal Dutch Shell. He had been Sr. Vice-President of a consulting company since late 1996.\n[589] Mr. Wallace's mandate was limited to a review of the process undertaken by the Professional Team in 2000, in addressing the impact on its 1993\/94 evaluations of the additional evidence that had subsequently arisen from a number of Canada Post witnesses.\n[590] He presented himself before the Tribunal as someone who had learned, on the job, a great deal about job evaluation and compensation design. His opinion, critical of the Professional Team process, was predicated on industrial standards with which he was familiar and which were, in his opinion, rather strict standards. He gave no deference to the need to give a large and liberal interpretation to human rights legislation.\n[591] The Tribunal, while giving no weight, for the reasons noted, to Ms. Winter's evidence concerning the evaluation process used by the Professional Team, does not totally dismiss the evidence presented by Messrs. Willis and Wallace. Rather, some of the criticisms expressed by them address features which, under normal circumstances, one would probably prefer not to be present in a job evaluation process. It is, therefore, a question of determining the degree of weight to be afforded.\n[592] Accordingly, after considering the expert evidence, the Tribunal has given less weight to the evidence of Canada Post's witnesses than it has to Dr. Wolf and the Professional Team.\n[593] Therefore, the Tribunal finds that it is more likely than not that the evaluation process which the Professional Team used in its work was reasonably reliable.\nVI. RELIABILITY OF JOB INFORMATION SOURCES AND RESULTING JOB INFORMATION USED BY THE PROFESSIONAL TEAM A. Background [594] All three parties have agreed on the vital importance of using reliable information and data in job evaluation plans of whatever stripe. Canada Post's three expert job evaluation witnesses stressed the need to work with reliable job information and data, although Ms. Winter's opinion encouraged a standard higher than reasonable reliability as her exchange with counsel for the Alliance, in cross-examination, confirmed:\nQ. So, are you suggesting then, or stating rather, that in order to accurately evaluate positions you need 100 percent job knowledge?\nA. Yes.176\n[595] Both Dr. Wolf and Mr. Willis testified that, in their respective opinions, one's understanding of the jobs to be evaluated (including the quality of the job information) is of first importance. Of second importance is the process to be followed:\nDr. Wolf: Even to be a Hay consultant, the amount of time that you need with the job evaluation process is less important than your understanding of the jobs. The rule of job evaluation is like in computers: it is garbage in, garbage out. If you don't understand the job, you can't evaluate it properly, no matter how much you know about the technology of the process.177\nMr. Willis: Next to the quality of the information, I'd say that the process is second in importance.178\n[596] As noted earlier in paragraph [413], the generally accepted standard of the job evaluation industry, of which all expert witnesses were aware, is to seek, to the extent possible, accuracy, consistency and completeness of job information being used for job evaluation purposes. Given the Tribunal's decision in this case to apply a reliability standard of `reasonableness' (paragraphs [412], [553]), this calls for reasonable accuracy, reasonable consistency and reasonable completeness.\n[597] Accordingly, reasonably reliable job information and data is an essential ingredient of job evaluation as a concept, given its inherent dependence on subjective human judgement. Decisions of evaluators who are using reasonably accurate, consistent and complete job information should, understandably, and indeed, logically, produce more realistic and acceptable results than using job information that may be questionable or flawed.\n[598] Although the Tribunal has already tracked the sources and the nature of the job information used in this case, in excruciating detail, it has decided to re-examine those sources\nand job information in condensed form in two stages, which the Tribunal has labelled for convenience of reference, as follows:\nFACTS I: These are the factual job information sources and the job information and data that resulted from those sources that existed prior to the date when the Professional Team began its work for the Alliance.\nFACTS II: These are the additional relevant data and evidence to which the Professional Team had access once it began its work.\nB. FACTS I (i) Composition [599] In summary form, FACTS I is comprised of the following:\nthe Job Fact Sheet\/Questionnaire which was completed in 1986 by sampled employees; it was designed to relate to the not fully developed System One job evaluation plan, by a senior Commission officer, without professional assistance. Although it was intended to serve as the primary source of up-to-date information for both the CR and the PO positions, it was used by the Commission, in fact, only for the CR positions; the Interview Guide was also designed by Commission staff, and based on System One. It was meant to be completed by Commission interviewers as a follow-up to the Job Fact Sheet\/Questionnaire. It was used for the CR employees only; interviews were completed by December 1986; job descriptions and organization charts which were expected to be attached to the Job Fact Sheet\/Questionnaire by the incumbent employee completing that form. Most CR job descriptions were \"unofficial\", including several CR Benchmark position descriptions; many CR organization charts were out-of-date; PO position samples were attempted with new 1989 lists of PO employees without success. In place of samples, 10 `generic' PO job specifications were drawn up in 1990\/1991 by the Commission, with Canada Post management personnel supplying the foundation information and materials, including \"unofficial\" job descriptions, and job profiles which identified responsibilities of each job. These job specifications were developed in a very different manner from that used for the CR positions which were determined by means of what the Commission called a random sample of CR employees occupying actual positions; the 10 `generic' jobs represented an amalgam of functions for 10 commonly held job types in the Postal Operations Group. They did not represent actual jobs or positions and did not have union approval. The PO supervisory sub-group, which constituted an element of the comparator group in the original Complaint, was not represented in the 10 `generic' PO job specifications, in contrast to the CR sample which included some supervisory representatives at the CR-5 level.\n[600] These were the key sources and the nature of the job information that resulted from those sources during the pre-Professional Team period of 1986 to 1991.\n[601] Related to these sources and the resulting job information, are four facts which have already been addressed elsewhere in this Decision, but are worthy of note in the context of FACTS I as they have potential impact on the nature of the job information arising from the sources.\n[602] The first is the uncertainty that surrounds the various unprofessional calculations of the CR sampling size. The original CR sample was developed by a Commission officer in 1986. In 1987, the Commission did not act upon Statistics Canada's advice regarding the CR sample size. The CR sample was subsequently reduced in 1991 by Commission staff.\n[603] The second is the fact that the Job Fact Sheet and the Interview Guide were both designed around the uncompleted System One evaluation system which had the endorsement of neither the Alliance nor Canada Post.\n[604] The third is that the job data were gathered at different times. The data for the CR positions were gathered in 1986. The bulk of the data for the `generic' PO jobs was assembled in 1990\/1991.\n[605] The fourth is the apparent incompatibility between the job information collected for the CR incumbent-held positions, and the job \"specifications\" compiled by the Commission for the non-incumbent-held `generic' PO jobs.\n[606] The Tribunal notes that it is undisputed by all parties that all of FACTS I occurred well before the Professional Team had been approached by the Alliance or had begun its work.\n(ii) Submissions of the Parties and Expert Witnesses [607] Focussing exclusively on the FACTS I elements, what were the principal arguments made by the parties and the expert witnesses in their respective submissions, about these elements?\n[608] There was virtual unanimity between Dr. Wolf and two of Canada Post's expert witnesses with respect to the 1986 Job Fact Sheet\/Questionnaire. It was Dr. Wolf who classified this document as `abominable', adding that \"...the guy who developed it probably should be taken out and shot\", (paragraph [445]). Both Mr. Willis and Ms. Winter dismissed it, Mr. Willis calling it \"...hopelessly inadequate for Pay Equity evaluation purposes\", (paragraph [497]). Canada Post, too, faulted it on the grounds it was self-evaluative, which was widely held, in job evaluation circles, to be unacceptable.\n[609] Despite Dr. Wolf's condemnation of the design of the Job Fact Sheet, he testified that he and his two colleagues still made some use of it by disregarding the self-evaluation aspects of the responses and focussing on the \"job description information\" that could be found in the completed document. In response to a question from Alliance counsel, Dr. Wolf said:\nSo you had to work against the tide, if you will, with these documents unfortunately, but there was information there. You just had to be selective in using it to make sure you didn't pay any attention to the extraneous part.179\n[610] Both Mr. Willis and Ms. Winter also faulted the 1986 Interview Guide believing it replicated many of the deficiencies of the Job Fact Sheet while noting that it too, was based on the not-fully-developed System One evaluation plan. Dr. Wolf, himself, testified that the Interview Guide did not add anything of significance to the Professional Team's understanding of the CR incumbents' duties.\n[611] Dr. Wolf acknowledged that some 50 of the CR job descriptions were unsigned and\/or undated, and that others were often out-of-date or \"unofficial,\" and even sometimes missing. Some did not include information on working conditions. Similarly, supporting organization charts were not always available or up-to-date.\n[612] Two of Canada Post's expert witnesses identified serious deficiencies in the job descriptions primarily in terms of age, accuracy, and official status and all three witnesses stressed the importance of those undertaking evaluations being entirely satisfied with the job descriptions.\n[613] Dr. Wolf admitted that because of the general unacceptability of the Job Fact Sheet which had been intended as the primary source document for job evaluation purposes, the Professional Team were compelled to rely on the available job descriptions as their primary document for the CR evaluations. He testified that he and his colleagues accepted the job descriptions as they were, provided they were in correct Canada Post format.\n[614] Dr. Wolf clarified what was meant by treating the job descriptions as the primary document in comparison with the Job Fact Sheet and the Interview Guide, in the following cross-examination exchange with Canada Post counsel:\n...when we say primary document, what we are saying is that when there is some question of the consistency of the documents, which one do we defer to, the answer is that we would defer to the Position Description as the official Canada Post document. So when we say it is the primary document, that is the one we would defer to.180\n[615] In those situations where there were no position descriptions - and this occurred in a fair number of instances (paragraph [448]) - Dr. Wolf agreed that such a deferment would, obviously, not be possible.\n[616] Mr. Willis, while recognizing that the PO job specifications came closer to providing factual job information than the CR documentation, cautioned that the former were based on management-supplied, not the more appropriate employee-supplied, job data. Moreover, he pointed out that, contrary to accepted practice, the job data for each of the CR and PO employee groups were collected by totally different processes and at two different periods of time.\n[617] Ms. Winter faulted the PO job specifications for not reflecting actual positions and being incomplete by not including the job rotational requirements of the PO-4 job level.\n[618] In considering the first of the four related facts - the uncertainty about CR sampling mentioned in paragraph [602] - it is necessary to turn to the evidence of the two expert witnesses, Drs. Bellhouse and Kervin.\n[619] There is an appreciable difference of opinion between these two expert witnesses. As noted earlier, Dr. Bellhouse argued that the Commission's original 1986 sampling design, upon which the selection of CR survey incumbents was based, was flawed. He also argued that the Commission's sampling of employees rather than positions led to biases in the sample which were compounded by the level of non-response in the survey for which corrective action was not taken.\n[620] In particular, under the circumstances of this case, where Dr. Bellhouse understood that the CR classification levels were comprised of overlapping intervals of Hay Plan points, he considered that a full census of each CR position would be the required route. When questioned by Alliance counsel about whether overlapping Hay points and pay based on those points was a compensation rather than a statistical issue, Dr. Bellhouse answered that, given the existence of such an overlap, his recommendation would be a census.\n[621] During the re-examination of Dr. Bellhouse by Canada Post counsel, Dr. Bellhouse agreed, however, that a full census could be avoided if one were seeking an average value per CR job title instead of per position. One would redefine the CR community by all of its job titles and, assuming a good deal of homogeneity, take an appropriate sample within each job title.181\n[622] The Tribunal notes that in earlier evidence relating to the failure of the Commission to implement a Statistics Canada recommendation in 1987 to augment the CR sample, Statistics Canada was commenting on the design of an acceptable random sample rather than a census.\n[623] With respect to the 10 PO `generic' jobs, Dr. Bellhouse did not regard them as a probability sample. He considered them, at best, to be a \"judgement sample\" with the possibility of substantial bias because it was a selection of particular job titles (paragraphs [454]-[459]).\n[624] Dr. Kervin's opinion was that Dr. Bellhouse over-emphasized the analytical nature of statistical analysis and the need for scientific quantitative reliability. Dr. Kervin's point was that Dr. Bellhouse failed to recognize the sociological, qualitative, and systemic issues involved in a \"pay equity\" case. Dr. Kervin further indicated that the representative sample of CR employees which formed the basis for the collection of data for the Complainant group was more than adequate. He agreed with Dr. Bellhouse that the 10 PO `generic' jobs constituted a \"judgement sample\" (paragraphs [466]-[468]).\n[625] The Tribunal is cognizant of the different backgrounds of these two experts. One gave his opinion evidence based upon his expertise as a professional statistician, the other based upon his expertise as a professional sociologist. Dr. Bellhouse, a Professor of Statistics, was qualified as an expert in statistics, with specialization in survey sampling. Dr. Kervin, a Professor of Sociology, was qualified as an expert in data collection and data analysis. As noted earlier, both have had considerable experience in working with paying clients, as well as students, in their respective fields of expertise. Judging from the evidence presented to qualify each as an expert, both are well regarded in their fields.\n[626] At this juncture, the issue is the reasonable reliability of the sampling methodology and the sample size employed for the CR population. Much of the expert evidence about implementing a \"pay equity\" study in normal circumstances underlined the need to seek expert advice from professionals. In this instance, expertise in the design and implementation of statistical survey sampling technology was necessary, but not sought initially for the 1986 sample.\n[627] Dr. Kervin was qualified as an expert in data collection and data analysis. He did not consider himself to be a professional statistician. In response to a question from Commission counsel, he said:\nI am not a statistician. I don't generate new statistics.\nI don't look at the properties of statistics. Instead, I use them...182\n[628] On the other hand, Dr. Bellhouse referred to himself as a \"sampling statistician\".183\n[629] Mr. Willis testified that the process of selecting the CR sample fell short of meeting the stringent sampling requirements of a \"pay equity\" case. Although he did not indicate that a census was a necessity, his opinion seemed to be closer to that of Dr. Bellhouse than that of Dr. Kervin.\n[630] Accordingly, the Tribunal is faced with two conflicting opinions about the CR random sample. Ideally, one would want to re-examine the sampling methodology employed. But, the Tribunal has noted that the original sample of incumbents was a significant one, representing almost ten percent of the total CR population. The Professional Team deliberately chose to evaluate the positions of the full original sample and not limit itself to the Commission's subsequently reduced sample level. Furthermore, there was no solid factual evidence provided to demonstrate that the full sample was unrepresentative of the total CR community.\n[631] The second related fact (paragraph [603]) concerns the reality that the Job Fact Sheet and the Interview Guide were both designed around the uncompleted System One job evaluation plan. The Professional Team employed the Hay factor comparison plan in conducting its job evaluations. Using one plan to design instrumentation - even if only partially used - and another to undertake job evaluations, is generally regarded, in the industry, as an unacceptable practice.\n[632] Certainly, the Commission's booklet published in 1992 entitled \"Implementing Pay Equity in the Federal Jurisdiction\", makes it very clear that \"...use of a single plan to evaluate all jobs is essential,\" (paragraph [358]), which would at least imply, if not explicitly state, that a single evaluation plan should govern all aspects of a particular job evaluation undertaking, including the gathering of job information documentation.\n[633] The third fact (paragraph [604]) relates to the gathering of job data at different times. The data for the CR positions were collected in 1986, the data for the PO `generic' jobs primarily in 1990\/1991. Mr. Willis commented on the desirability of collecting job information for all jobs being compared within a reasonable period of time of each other.\n[634] The fourth fact (paragraph [605]) concerns the incongruity between the job information collected from incumbent CR employees and the job \"specifications\" compiled by the Commission for the non-incumbent `generic' PO jobs. Two of Canada Post's experts questioned such an approach.\n(iii) Credibility of Evidence of Expert Witnesses [635] What has been the position of each of the parties concerning the source materials that make up what the Tribunal has called FACTS I?\n[636] Canada Post has said, in effect, that the information documented in FACTS I cannot be relied upon to determine reliable job evaluations.\n[637] The Alliance has questioned the credibility of all three of Canada Post's expert witnesses - Ms. Winter largely on the basis of not meeting the standard of independence of an expert witness, and being too categorical or exaggerated in presenting her opinions; Mr. Willis for not having read all the documentation sent to him by Canada Post, and also on the grounds of either being unable, or refusing, to comprehend the litigious context of the Complaint; and Mr. Wallace for not having had access to much of the documentation involved in the case, and his tendency to highlight the negative while ignoring the positive.\n[638] The Commission discounted the evidence of Ms. Winter essentially on the basis that she relied on the standard of correctness as the foundation for her expert opinions. Mr. Willis' credibility was questioned by the Commission on the basis of being unclear, even ambiguous and evasive about how long he had taken to review the job materials sent to him by Canada Post. The Commission submitted that Mr. Wallace's critical opinion of the job information should be largely discounted because he did not, nor was he asked, to review most of the job documentation.\n[639] Insofar as the three Canada Post expert witnesses are concerned, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence of Messrs. Willis and Wallace should not be completely dismissed. Aspects of their evidence deserve some weight. As for Ms. Winter, in the Tribunal's view, her absolutist standard of correctness on virtually all fronts requiring a judgement about reliability, rendered her opinions beyond acceptance.\n[640] Mr. Willis, however, was a witness with considerable years of experience in the job evaluation industry. Perhaps, he was somewhat evasive, and even acerbic on occasion, as when, for example, in response to a question from Canada Post's counsel, he said:\n...the CHRC and PSAC's three consultants were faced with having to do work with inadequate data. I think it was so inadequate that neither one of them could - without additional input, without additional information, I don't see how either one of them could have done a satisfactory job.\nIn my overall analysis, I cannot back down one step: they are both junk...184\n[641] Mr. Willis' attitude should not completely overrule his expertise. His service to the Joint Union-Management Initiative, and subsequently as an expert witness on the Treasury Board case, are illustrative of the depth of his knowledge and experience, and his reputation in his field.\n[642] The Tribunal appreciates the sheer volume of materials that existed in this case. There were over 400 transcripts and about a thousand supporting exhibits alone. Although not all of this documentation was sent to Mr. Willis, he did receive a significant amount of material to review. For an expert witness of the calibre and continental standing of Mr. Willis, some of the documentation in FACTS I, such as that concerning the CR sample methodology, the design of the Job Fact Sheet and the Interview Guide, would have pointed to deficiencies which were readily apparent without having read all the materials.\n[643] Mr. Wallace also had considerable experience in the field of job evaluation. While his mandate, in this case, covered a more limited aspect and period of time, involving far less documentation than Mr. Willis, his knowledge and depth in applying the objectives and principles of job evaluation, particularly in the private sector, and in \"pay equity\" situations, were impressive.\nC. FACTS II (i) Composition and Impact [644] FACTS II constitutes the additional relevant information, data and evidence, beyond FACTS I, to which the Professional Team had access in undertaking its CR and PO job evaluations in 1993\/1994 (supplemented in 2000).\n[645] One such additional item which the Alliance had provided to the Team was Hay documentation which the Commission had originally received from the Hay organization, including Guide Charts and a variety of samples of definitions of Hay evaluating factors. Dr. Ingster advised in correspondence with the Alliance that the Hay documentation had not been tailored for Commission use but was rather general Hay presentational material.\n[646] The Professional Team also had access, in 1993, to the Commission's Rationale Statements which recorded its ratings, and reasons therefor, for its 1991 job evaluations of the reduced sample of 93 CR incumbents. The Commission's 1991 CR evaluations were based on the XYZ Hay Plan. The Team also drew on its own evaluations of the original 93 sample to provide Reference Positions for its second phase of 97 CR's which it undertook in 1994. Notes taken by Professional Team members during their telephone interviews with CR incumbents conducted in May 1993 and September 1994, were further CR position materials in the Team's possession.\n[647] For the PO community, the Professional Team had access to behavioural dimensions for each job which the Commission had obtained from Canada Post as well as the Commission's Rationale Statements indicating its 1991 job evaluation ratings, and reasons therefor, of the 10 `generic' jobs based on the XYZ Hay Plan. Dr. Ingster had advised, however, in his letter of July 21, 1993 to the Alliance, that the behavioural dimensions and job profiles had not been provided for four of the 10 PO `generic' jobs.\n[648] A Commission-prepared document was also furnished which included descriptions of the knowledge and skill, problem solving, responsibility and working conditions characteristics of the 10 PO `generic' jobs. Finally, the Team also referred to a variety of Canada Post operator handbooks, postal guides and related materials.\n[649] Subsequent to the Professional Team's 1993\/1994 CR and PO job evaluations, there was, in 1997, newly-found CR documentation which included several, but not all, of the previously missing job descriptions. However, Dr. Wolf, on behalf of the Team, concluded that this additional material was not significant enough to re-evaluate the Team's earlier evaluations.\n[650] In the year 2000, the Professional Team undertook a review of the possible impact on its 1993\/1994 job evaluations of a considerable amount of evidence which had been submitted to the Tribunal during the period of 1995 to 2000, by a number of Canada Post witnesses.\n[651] This voluminous new evidence consisted of approximately 4,000 pages of written material including transcripts of many days of testimony-in-chief and of cross-examination concerning job content, primarily for the 10 `generic' PO jobs. A considerable number of exhibits were also involved such as Canada Post manuals, handbooks and training materials. Several other exhibits were provided by the Alliance and the Commission.\n[652] Dr. Wolf screened this extensive documentation and extracted material that he considered was not relevant to job evaluation. The balance was then referred to the full Professional Team. Canada Post's counsel questioned whether this was an acceptable practice to discard material before it had been seen by his two colleagues.\n[653] Dr. Wolf indicated in his evidence that he and his two colleagues had concluded, based on this new material, that each of the 10 `generic' jobs probably described few, if any, of the many incumbents of those jobs. Few, if any, would be performing all of the duties described. In response, and in fairness to all incumbents, Dr. Wolf and his two colleagues chose to re-evaluate the 10 `generic' jobs based on the assumption that all incumbents were performing all of the respective duties concerned.\n[654] The Professional Team concluded that the new evidence had no impact on their CR evaluations but had some impact on their PO `generic' job evaluations. For example, Dr. Wolf testified that:\n...the range of content within any one of the PO jobs was much greater than we had originally realized. The 10 jobs really represent many more than that.185\n[655] Dr. Wolf reported that several changes in evaluation point values resulted from the re-evaluation of the 10 `generic' jobs. Five of the PO `generic' jobs had no changes in their evaluation point values, and three jobs had minimal changes of three points or less. Two `generic' jobs had significant changes in point value. The Counter Clerk `generic' went up in value while the Relief Mail Services Courier `generic' went down in value.\n[656] Consequently, FACTS II provided the Professional Team with a fair amount of additional job information, data and background material to that provided by FACTS I. The question, therefore, arises: how useful did this FACTS II additional job information and background material prove to be?\n[657] Undoubtedly, it added to the Professional Team's overall perspective of the nature and work of the employee groups involved in the Complaint. While a good portion of the new material related solely to the Postal Operations Group (PO) of employees, there was also additional material covering the CR community.\n[658] For example, the Professional Team's CR employee telephone interview notes served as new material which was helpful in providing a focus on the working conditions factor of the CR positions involved.\n[659] As already noted, Dr. Wolf confirmed that the Professional Team's review of the newly found CR documentation in 1997 was not sufficiently significant to re-evaluate the Team's earlier evaluations. On the other hand, the Team's review of the new evidence arising from the Canada Post witnesses over the period 1995 to 2000 did result in major changes in evaluated point values for two of the 10 PO generic jobs.\n[660] All told, the Tribunal finds that the evidence supports the view that while much of the new job information and background materials that made up FACTS II did not add a substantive new dimension to the core job information base of FACTS I, it did augment and fortify the Professional Team's understanding of the jobs and positions to be evaluated.\nD. FACTS I and II Compared to Reliability Standard of the Job Evaluation Industry [661] How did the job information and data of FACTS I and II measure-up to the generally accepted standard of the job evaluation industry, as described in paragraph [596]? In other words, how reasonably accurate, how reasonably consistent and how reasonably complete were the job information\/data used by the Professional Team (FACTS I and II) in undertaking its job evaluations in 1993\/1994 (supplemented in 2000)?\n[662] The deficiencies already well documented above in the job descriptions which the Professional Team came to regard as their primary source documents for the CR positions are, perhaps, one of the best illustrations of a general lack of accuracy, consistency and completeness. Dr. Wolf, himself, acknowledged the many deficiencies including out-of-date, incomplete, unofficial and even missing CR job descriptions.\n[663] Canada Post was supported by Mr. Willis and Ms. Winter in commenting on the lack of accuracy, consistency and completeness in many of the CR job descriptions, noting that generally they did not include information on working conditions. Mr. Wallace also stated in his report that there was a \"...lack of complete and consistent documentation\".186\n[664] Even the Commission cautioned about the use of job descriptions in its booklet on implementing \"pay equity\", as follows:\n...job descriptions should not be used on their own or treated as the primary source of data, since they often replicate prevailing stereotypes and are not always an up-to-date, accurate reflection of work done, (paragraph [358]).\n[665] An inconsistency also occurred in the use of the Interview Guide with CR incumbents. Certain changes in its original design, proposed by a representative of the Alliance, were accepted by the Commission after interviews had already begun, resulting in two versions of the Interview Guide having been in the system.\n[666] Questions of inconsistency and incompleteness also arose in evidence about the CR sample which included supervisors at the CR-5 level, while the PO supervisor's sub-group had been dropped by the Commission from the PO `generic' jobs. Similarly, lack of consistency was expressed over the appreciable difference in the dates of information collection - 1986 for the CR's and 1990\/1991 for the PO `generic' jobs. Mr. Willis, for example, indicated that all data involved in job evaluation should, ideally, be collected during the same time period and as near as practicable, to the date of performance of the job evaluations. He considered this to be important because of the tendency of jobs to change over time.\n[667] The Alliance and the Commission did not really directly address the industry standard of attaining reasonable accuracy, consistency and completeness of job information used in job evaluation undertakings. Both parties tended to discredit the evidence, in this regard, of Messrs. Willis and Wallace on the basis of not having read all the relevant documentation and not having performed CR and PO job evaluations themselves. They contended, therefore, that the opinions of Messrs. Willis and Wallace were based on incomplete information, and should be rejected. As only Dr. Wolf and his two colleagues had worked through all the job documentation and actively performed job evaluations, the Commission and the Alliance urged that Dr. Wolf's opinions be accepted.\n[668] Interestingly, Dr. Wolf openly acknowledged particular inaccuracies, inconsistencies and incompleteness in job information, which were referred to above.\nE. Tribunal's Analysis (i) A Daunting Task [669] In undertaking this final analysis of the job information used in this case, the Tribunal is reminded of the following two factors which were observed earlier in this Decision.\n[670] Both Dr. Wolf and Mr. Willis confirmed that in conducting job evaluations, the quality of the job information and one's understanding of the jobs are paramount, out-matching either the evaluation plan or the process involved.\n[671] The Alliance and the Commission chose to rely exclusively on the Professional Team's job evaluations performed in 1993\/1994, (supplemented in 2000), to substantiate the Complaint. In effect, the Alliance and the Commission have asked that the Commission's job evaluations performed in each of 1987 and 1991 be ignored in favour of those conducted by the Professional Team. What cannot be ignored, however, is the fact that a portion of the source materials used by the Team to conduct its evaluations was, essentially, the information that the Commission had employed in its own earlier evaluations, that is FACTS I.\n[672] The Tribunal's assessment and weighing of the evidence submitted by each of the parties and expert witnesses concerning this issue of the reliability of the job information has been a daunting task.\n[673] There is little doubt that the job information (FACTS I and II) employed by the Professional Team in conducting its job evaluations did not meet the standard that one would normally expect from a joint employer-employee \"pay equity\" study. But, given the somewhat painful and prolonged circumstances of the case before this Tribunal, was the job information \"good enough\", on a balance of probabilities, to generate reasonably reliable job\/position values that, in turn, could be used to demonstrate whether or not there was a wage gap?\n[674] Dr. Wolf, as spokesman for the Professional Team, acknowledged that he and his two colleagues found many shortcomings in the available job data. But he also said that their job understanding was \"...adequate but not necessarily ideal...\" (paragraph [484]).\n[675] By \"adequate\", the Tribunal suggested in paragraph [486], one might consider \"sufficient\" as an acceptable synonym.\n[676] The Tribunal sees little value in attempting to attribute blame for the state of the job information but notes that the Alliance counsel in his final oral argument stated the following:\nIf we have less than an ideal view of the PO work, I suggest to you that, in large measure, that has been caused by decisions made by Canada Post.187\n[677] At the same time, the Tribunal notes that section 43 of the Act furnishes the Commission with certain powers to obtain relevant documentation from a respondent while conducting its investigation of a complaint. Hence, the Tribunal accepts that the Commission, and perhaps even the Complainant, could also be held partially accountable for the job information available in this case.\n[678] Another aspect which the Tribunal believes deserves mention and over which the Professional Team had no direct input relates to the CR sample. While the conflicting positions of expert witnesses Drs. Bellhouse and Kervin have been documented above, it is helpful to note the following final oral argument made by the Alliance's counsel which adds yet another dimension to that issue:\nI will point out one factor that you might consider, however, and that is that when you are looking at the data, one of the things that stuck in my mind, the representivity of the data, you go back to the root cause of the alleged problems with the CR sample, and the problem comes from the fact that Canada Post gave the Commission an out-of-date employee list. That is the origin, that is the genesis of the need to go and get other employees.\nI am not going to tell you that the Commission was perfect in what they did, but nor was Canada Post. It certainly would be inequitable for Canada Post to now come to the Tribunal and say that you can't rely on the data when they were responsible for providing the information to the Commission.188\n[679] To answer the question of whether or not the job information was reasonably reliable, the Tribunal found the following excerpt helpful:\nIn Anglo-Canadian law ... the courts have consistently held that if the plaintiff establishes that a loss has probably been suffered, the difficulty of determining the amount of it can never excuse the wrongdoer from paying damages. If the amount is difficult to estimate, the tribunal must simply do its best on the material available, though of course if the plaintiff has not adduced evidence that might have been expected to be adduced if the claim were sound, the omission will tell against the plaintiff. In Ratcliffe v. Evans, Bower L.J. said:\nAs much certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be the vainest pedantry.189\n[680] While the aforementioned excerpt relates to the law of damages, the Tribunal finds that it addresses an approach that may be analogous to what the Tribunal considers to be the spectrum of reasonable reliability. The Tribunal has already accepted (paragraph [596]) that a standard of `reasonableness' should apply in determining the reliability of the job evaluation system chosen, the process followed and the job information used. An absolutist standard of `correctness' has been dismissed as has the evidence of Ms. Winter on these same grounds.\n[681] The publication of Professor Waddams, cited above, to which, interestingly, both the Commission and the Alliance made reference in the context of their submissions on Remedy, refers to the need for a tribunal, in determining damages, to \"do its best on the material available,\" because the difficulty of determining the amount of damages \"can never excuse the wrongdoer from paying damages.\" The citation goes on to state from the Ratcliffe v. Evans case that to insist upon more than reasonable certainty in pleading and proof of damage \"would be the vainest pedantry,\" and to insist upon less \"would be to relax old and intelligible principles\".190\n[682] In other words, absolutism should probably be avoided at both ends of the spectrum. A standard of 100% correctness is unacceptable at the top end of the spectrum as is a standard at the lower end which simply dismisses everything as being entirely worthless. This conception of a spectrum is certainly relevant to the Tribunal's decision concerning the reasonable reliability of the documentation used to conduct the evaluations in this Complaint.\n[683] In view of the circumstances of this particular case and the remedial nature of human rights legislation calling for a purposive, broad and liberal interpretation, the Tribunal finds that a similarly broad and liberal approach, using the analogy of the spectrum, is appropriate to a decision concerning the reasonable reliability of the job information. While the job information may not meet the degree of reliability that should normally be sought for a \"pay equity\" situation, is it \"adequate\", as Dr. Wolf indicated it was, for this specific situation? Alternatively, should the job information used by the Professional Team, with its various deficiencies, be dismissed as being entirely worthless, and as absolutely without merit, along the lines of Mr. Willis' opinion?\n[684] The Tribunal believes these questions are best answered in the context of the total job evaluation undertaking - that is the job evaluation plan selected, and above all, the evaluators involved.\n[685] Given the very considerable job evaluation experience of Drs. Wolf and Ingster of the Professional Team, including their application, over many years, of the Hay system to a wide-range of jobs involving a variety of job information, the Tribunal considers that their opinion concerning the reliability of the available job information was particularly compelling.\n[686] Moreover, Dr. Wolf was not hesitant to identify deficiencies in instruments such as the Job Fact Sheet and certain job descriptions. He also demonstrated an ability to adapt to the situation before him as illustrated in his remarks about being \"selective\" in using data included in the Job Fact Sheet (paragraph [609]). He obviously knew how to avoid the most offensive aspects of that document. He and his two colleagues were therefore very aware of the imperfections, including certain inconsistencies and even incompleteness, in the job information, but still concluded that the material was \"adequate\" for the work being performed by the Professional Team.\n[687] The Professional Team also benefited from the augmentation of the FACTS I base data by means of the FACTS II material. Examples include the new working conditions information that arose from the telephone interviews with the CR sample members contacted. Another, was the re-evaluation of the 10 PO `generic' jobs in the year 2000 based on considerable new evidence from a number of Canada Post witnesses, resulting in two significant job value revisions.\n[688] In responding to a question from Alliance counsel about his \"comfort level\" with the overall evaluations performed by the Professional Team, Dr. Wolf replied as follows, implying that the job information was at least adequate:\nI feel that these evaluations are valid representations of the particular jobs at hand. I wouldn't have evaluated the job if I didn't feel we could evaluate it in a meaningful and appropriate way. That's why we punted on the four we punted on, because we felt we just couldn't accurately evaluate those jobs.191\n[689] The Tribunal must confess that navigating the job information through the straits of \"reasonable reliability\" has not been a relaxing passage. Yet, balancing the evidence presented by all parties and expert witnesses, and under the unique circumstances of this case in the realm of proscribed discrimination human rights legislation, the Tribunal finds that the job information, in the hands of the Professional Team, was more likely than not, \"reasonably reliable\", or \"adequate\" as that Team described it, despite certain imperfections.\n(ii) Definitions and Sub-bands of Acceptability [690] Recognizing the significance of this conclusion, the Tribunal wishes to record how it decided to handle what it considers to be one of the most challenging aspects of this case. To assist itself in analysing the many facets of the available job information and testing for the \"reasonable reliability\" of that information, the Tribunal found it necessary to re-examine the definitions with which it was working.\n[691] Firstly, the expression used by Dr. Wolf in describing the Professional Team's job understanding was \" ... adequate but not necessarily ideal...\". The Tribunal drew on Webster's and Oxford's definitions of the word \"adequate\" in paragraph [485]. Both dictionaries included \"sufficient\" as one of their definitions of \"adequate\". In turn, both dictionaries have defined \"sufficient\" as being \"adequate\" or \"enough\". The word \"ideal\" is defined by Webster as \"a standard of perfection or excellence\", and by Oxford as \"conceived as perfect in its kind\".\n[692] How do these definitions compare to the meaning of \"reasonably reliable\"? Webster defines \"reasonable\" as \"not exceeding the limit prescribed by reason, not excessive, moderate\". Oxford defines \"reasonable\" as \"not going beyond the limit assigned by reason, not extravagant or excessive, moderate\". Webster defines \"reliable\" as \"consistently dependable in character, judgements, performances or result\". Oxford defines \"reliable\" as \"in which confidence may be put, trustworthy, safe, sure\".\n[693] \"Reasonably reliable\" job information can therefore, be interpreted as being job information that is consistently, moderately dependable or in which moderate confidence can be put. The words \"adequate\" and \"sufficient\" are interchangeable. While some might consider \"consistently, moderately dependable\" or \"moderate confidence\" to be more demanding than \"adequate\" or \"sufficient\", in terms of the level of quality, the Tribunal concluded that they are generally equivalent for the situation at hand.\n[694] Accordingly, the Tribunal regarded the term \"reasonably reliable\" and the words \"adequate\" and \"sufficient\" as being interchangeable for the purpose of determining the state of reliability of the job information available in this case. Obviously, the word \"ideal\" sets a standard of correctness well beyond the standard of \"reasonable reliability\".\n[695] Having clarified the terminology governing the standard of reliability, the Tribunal concluded that it is more likely than not that there is no one exact point that represents \"reasonable\" reliability, or \"adequate\" reliability. Rather, it is more likely than not that a range or band of acceptability represents what is meant by \"reasonable\" or \"adequate\" reliability. Some candidate items may fit more comfortably than others within that band, but all that pass the test of entry are considered to be reasonably or adequately or sufficiently reliable.\n[696] While the Tribunal concluded that it is difficult, and probably unwise, to attempt to be quantitatively precise about the width of the range or band of acceptability, it found that it was administratively useful to think in terms of three possible sub-bands. The first sub-band represents the upper percentiles of the band, the second sub-band represents the mid-percentiles, and the third sub-band the lower percentiles. The Tribunal called these respectively, \"upper reasonable reliability\", \"mid reasonable reliability\" and \"lower reasonable reliability\".\n[697] In undertaking its study of the massive sea of material and testimony of this multi-year case, the Tribunal evolved to the view that ultimate fairness to all parties in a \"pay equity\" case would probably be achieved when the quality of the job information concerned fell comfortably into the \"upper reasonable reliability\" sub-band. The higher the sub-band level within the band of \"reasonable reliability\", the higher the quality and the more accurate the eventual values attributed to the jobs and positions involved - at least in theory.\n[698] Thus, while all three sub-bands meet the test of \"reasonable reliability\", the upper sub-band meets the test more abundantly and should, in the Tribunal's view, be the preferred choice for a \"pay equity\" situation.\n[699] At this point, the Tribunal asked itself, into which sub-band would it place the job information which the Professional Team employed in this case? Given the number of reservations and imperfections in the available job information already identified in the foregoing review, the Tribunal concluded that that information could not be comfortably classified as \"upper reasonably reliable\". Nor was the Tribunal content to accept the job information as fitting, however tightly, into the \"mid reasonably reliable\" sub-band. The Tribunal did, however, agree that the most suitable home for the job information was the \"lower reasonably reliable\" sub-band.\n[700] Hence, the Tribunal found, as stated in paragraph [689], that it was more likely than not that the job information utilized by the Professional Team in conducting its job evaluations of the CR and PO positions\/jobs pertinent to this case, was reasonably reliable, albeit at the \"lower reasonably reliable\" sub-band level.\nVII. WAGE GAP AND WAGE ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY A. Introduction [701] Having found that it is more likely than not, that the \"off-the-shelf\" Hay Plan being used in the traditional factor comparison methodology, the process followed and the job information utilized by the Professional Team in conducting its CR and PO positions\/jobs evaluations were reasonably reliable, the next questions to be addressed are:\nHow reliable were the resulting job evaluation values attributed by the Professional Team to the CR positions and PO jobs concerned?\nWas a \"wage gap\" demonstrated between the female and male predominant groups performing work of equal value?\n[702] The Tribunal has already established the credibility of the three members of the Professional Team, having noted their qualifications in paragraph [382]. More particularly, Dr. Wolf was qualified as an expert in Hay-based job evaluation and Hay-based compensation.\n[703] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that the aforementioned reasonably reliable Hay Plan, process and job information, in the hands of competent evaluators, as were the Professional Team, would result in reasonably reliable job evaluation values being attributed to the work performed by CR and PO employees.\n[704] The Professional Team in its Final Report on the Hay Method Evaluation concluded:\nHaving found that a substantial portion of the CR jobs are of a value equal to, or greater than, that of the PO jobs, the logical next step was to identify the nature of the wage gap, if any, between the male-dominated PO jobs and the female-dominated CR jobs.192\n[705] In comparing its CR and PO job evaluation values with CR and PO hourly compensation rates, the Professional Team stated in its Report (Exhibit PSAC-30), that it did so for each of three years: 1983, representing the year the Complaint was filed; 1989, the year the Commission used for its wage analysis, and 1995, the year of the Professional Team's Report. The hourly wage rates were supplied by the Alliance and were assumed to be correct. The top rate was used in all cases.\n[706] As its wage adjustment methodology, the Professional Team employed a level-to-line method in which a male wage line was developed against which female pay rates were compared. The Team used this level-to-line approach because it is an indirect comparison frequently used in \"pay equity\" situations involving large organizations as distinct from a direct job-to-job approach. The male wage line represents a \"pattern\" of male jobs plotted on a graph, using total job evaluation point values as one axis of the graph and wages as the other. Once this is done, the intersection of point values and wages for the female jobs, plotted similarly using the same graph, is compared to the male line at particular intersection positions.\n[707] The Professional Team developed eight different male wage or pay lines which it designated Approaches A to H inclusive, including one for each of PO-INT jobs (Approach A), PO-EXT jobs (Approach B), and an average of PO-INT and EXT jobs (Approach E), for each of the three chosen years. One job-to-job comparison was also undertaken, or \"position matching\" as the Team called it (Approach H).\n[708] Analyses by the Professional Team of the pay relationships between the male-dominated PO jobs and the female-dominated CR positions revealed a wage gap no matter which level-to-line method was used. A similar result occurred with the \"position matching\" approach. These findings were equally true for each of the years 1983, 1989, and 1995.\n[709] The Professional Team concluded that \"all of these approaches show a significant gap between the wages paid to CR's and to PO's performing work of equal value\".193 Although there were differences in the size of the wage gap across the various approaches, the Professional Team characterized these differences as \"relatively minor.\"\n[710] From a compensation perspective, the Professional Team's expert opinion was that the best measure of the pay discrepancy between the PO and CR jobs\/positions was based on the PO-INT male wage line (Approach A) or the \"position matching\" option (Approach H). The Team felt this was so because the INT jobs seemed to be a closer match to the CR positions in terms of job content.\nB. Submissions of the Parties (i) The Alliance [711] The Alliance submitted that once a wage gap has been established, it is necessary to decide upon the most appropriate method of closing it between the CR's and the PO's. It also submitted that closing the gap is best done by means of employing a \"wage adjustment methodology\".\n[712] Of the eight male pay lines drawn up by the Professional Team, the Alliance's preferred approach was an adjustment to the average of the INT and EXT pay line - Approach E - because the Alliance felt it best represented the pay practices of the male comparator group. As already noted, the Professional Team's preference was the INT pay line (Approach A) though it accepted that Approach E was also workable.\n[713] The Alliance's witness, Mr. Terrence Ranger, whose evidence was heard in November 1995, supported the Alliance's position. The Tribunal was not asked to qualify Mr. Ranger as an expert witness.\n[714] Mr. Ranger stated that he was, at the time he gave his evidence, employed by the Alliance as Section Head of Research in the Collective Bargaining Branch. This branch included six research officers who served on negotiating teams and provided background support for bargaining demands. The officers also undertook compensation analysis in the areas of direct wages and benefits such as pension, dental and health care plans. He was first engaged by the Alliance in 1976 as a senior research officer. He confirmed that he had been called as a witness before the tribunal which handled the Treasury Board case.194 There, he had been asked to calculate the monies required to close a wage gap that had been determined by one of the statistical consultants involved in that case.\n[715] Mr. Ranger testified that he had reviewed Dr. Lee's Report195 and the Professional Team's Reports196, and had, as his objective, to cost for each year of the Complaint, the payments that would be necessary to close the wage gaps that had been determined by the Professional Team in its eight different approaches. Since the Team's calculations had been limited to the years 1983, 1989, and 1995, Mr. Ranger indicated that he produced pay lines based on the Team's methodology for each of the years from 1981 to 1995. The starting year of 1981 reflected the year that Canada Post became a Crown Corporation. He used what he called \"annual equivalent\" direct wage rates for each 12-month period and excluded \"indirect wages\" from his calculations in line with Dr. Lee's conclusions.\n[716] In effect, Mr. Ranger testified, he had replicated what the Professional Team had done, using the same methodology, with the addition of employee population levels. These, he understood were Canada Post numbers which had been obtained either by the Alliance or directly from the Agreed Statement of Facts. For the years 1981 to 1985, he assumed the population figures would be the same as for 1986. Mr. Ranger then multiplied the wage gap identified by the Professional Team for each of the eight approaches, by the number of working hours per year and by the number of employees concerned.\n[717] Mr. Ranger's conclusion was that the Professional Team's Approach E - the average of INT and EXT male pay lines - offered the best representation of the comparator population and therefore, the most appropriate remedy for this case. He recognized that the payout would be less under Approach E than under the Professional Team's preferred Approach A.\n[718] Mr. Ranger cautioned that the employee population data he used should be regarded as \"estimates\" as the data were taken at particular points in time and were assumed to be full-time employees for the entire 12-month period. In reality, some full-time employees may not have been employed in a given position for the full 12 months of a year, and some are believed to have been part-time employees. Consequently, this would, Mr. Ranger indicated, impact on his costing.\n[719] Mr. Ranger went on to testify that the total possible wage gap payout to CR employees that he had calculated as being just over $124 million (excluding \"indirect wages\"), should be regarded as \"an estimate\", and maybe even \"...a ballpark estimate that's on the high side\".\n[720] He also testified as follows:\nI am not suggesting that the $124 million be the settlement cost; it is some indication of the global costing of this complaint, but I don't think that anyone here could come up with that amount. I think that what should be identified are the hourly amounts that are required and then each individual employee will receive the amount that is due to them based on those hourly amounts and the amount of time they worked during the period. The final cost in fact won't be known to us, to anybody, until all of this is implemented.197\n[721] When he was cross-examined by Canada Post's counsel, Mr. Ranger agreed that any equal pay adjustments should be \"pay for all purposes\". He explained that this meant the adjustment would also include any statutory remittances that Canada Post might have to make arising from the basic adjustment. He cited examples such as the employer's obligations involved in items like superannuation, employment insurance and health tax. Although these would add to Canada Post's costs, they had not been quantified by Mr. Ranger.\n[722] The Alliance was strongly supportive of the \"pay for all purposes\" concept and submitted that monies payable to CR's to close the wage gap must be so classified. Appropriate adjustments would have to be made to reflect the cost of such statutory remittances.\n[723] Under further questioning by Canada Post's counsel, Mr. Ranger confirmed that for purposes of his wage gap calculations he used the maximum wage rate allotted in the range of wage rates for a given position or job. Although positions or jobs with particular evaluation points will fall into specific wage bands and incumbents may be earning different rates within a given band depending on length of time in that position or job, for Mr. Ranger's quantification of the cost of closing the wage gap, he assumed each job or position was paid at the highest level allowed.\n[724] The Alliance also submitted that the \"fold-in\" principle should be implemented at the time of the wage adjustment to close the wage gap. The submission was that, as of the date of the final Tribunal Decision, an adjustment would be made to the base wage rates in the CR collective agreement such that wages for CR's would be the same as wages for PO's for work of equal value. The adjustment would be folded into the base CR wage rate.\n[725] As an alternative to Mr. Ranger's endorsement of the Professional Team's wage adjustment methodology, the Alliance submitted that the job-based methodology of Dr. Kervin would be acceptable for this case. The Alliance considered that Dr. Kervin's approach produced very similar wage gaps to those found by the Professional Team and Mr. Ranger.\n[726] In conclusion, the Alliance submitted that the final actual costing of the wage gaps will require additional work. For example, an examination of individual employee records held by Canada Post will be necessary. Additionally, the Professional Team's changes in certain PO job evaluations, arising from its review, in June 2000, of the evidence of Canada Post witnesses, will impact on wage gap calculations. These changes were identified in the Professional Team's Report (Exhibit PSAC-180).\n(ii) The Commission [727] The Commission submitted that an award of lost wages is warranted to address the wage gap that has been demonstrated to exist between the CR and the PO employee groups in this case. It was also submitted by the Commission that the most appropriate wage adjustment methodology to use in calculating this particular award is a level-to-line approach using a combined male line such as the Professional Team's Approach E.\n[728] It was noted by the Commission that most \"pay equity\" cases which are systemic in nature involve occupational groups which do not always lend themselves to direct comparisons of the value of the work performed. In the instant case, since the jobs of the PO-INT and PO-EXT sub-groups do not provide direct comparators for the CR positions, the Commission submitted that, as permitted by section 15 of the 1986 Guidelines, an indirect comparison between female and male work must be used. This, argued the Commission, involves the construction of a male pay line using regression analysis.\n[729] The Commission also argued that such an indirect comparison, by means of the level-to-line wage adjustment methodology, would be compatible with what Drs. Wolf and Kervin and Mr. Ranger had recommended. It would also be consistent with the approach taken in the Treasury Board case.198\n[730] The male pay line, according to the Commission's submissions, should combine all relevant male data available. This would best be accomplished using Approach E from the Professional Team's options. It would also accord with the choices of Dr. Kervin and Mr. Ranger, and is consistent with section 14 of the 1986 Guidelines. That section notes that when a comparison is made between the occupational group that filed a complaint alleging a difference in wages, and other occupational groups, those other groups are deemed to be one group.\n[731] The Commission submitted that the most appropriate wage adjustment approach for the female job values was one based upon a level as opposed to a female wage line. Hence, the level-to-line designation. Dr. Wolf and Mr. Ranger had based their female level on the average of the evaluation scores of the positions within each CR level.\n[732] The Commission submitted that, while neither it nor the Alliance had the ability to determine which positions comprised the jobs for the CR sample, Canada Post in May 1999 provided, through its witness Mr. Brian Wilson, a Report on rolling-up the evaluated CR positions into jobs.199 Mr. Wilson, a Canada Post retiree since late 1995, had spent over 30 years with the company, having started as a letter carrier and moved progressively through the labour relations and human resources supervisory and management ranks.\n[733] It was the Commission's submission that Dr. Mark Killingsworth, another of Canada Post's witnesses, then determined the average values of these jobs, using the evaluated CR positions and their gender predominance from Mr. Wilson's material. The Commission argued that it was from Dr. Killingsworth's determinations that Dr. Kervin, the Alliance's witness, was able to provide his expert advice on how to calculate the level-to-line \"pay equity\" adjustments.\n[734] Dr. Killingsworth was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert witness in labour economics including econometrics. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree \"with high distinction\" in Economics from the University of Michigan in 1967. He then attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship, earning a B. Phil in Economics in 1969 and his D. Phil in Economics in 1977. At the time of his first appearance before the Tribunal in May 1999, he was Professor of Economics at Rutgers University in New Jersey, a position he had held since 1988. He was also serving as Research Economist for the National Bureau of Economic Research, having been in that post since 1984. He is the author of a number of publications on Comparable Worth (the U.S. term for \"pay equity\") and has undertaken considerable research in that and related fields.\n[735] Because Dr. Kervin's analysis involved the use of CR jobs rather than CR positions, this is the Commission's favoured approach. The Commission argued that many experts agree that the preferred unit of analysis for equal pay studies is \"jobs\". A \"job\" is a collection of duties usually performed by several or many individual employees occupying \"positions\".\n[736] Whether the \"jobs\" or the \"positions\" approach was used to calculate the female level, the Commission submitted that the level-to-line methodology was preferable in this case. It does, however, assume that each level is based on a representative sample of predominantly female jobs. The Commission reminded the Tribunal that Dr. Kervin's expert opinion was that the CR sample was adequately representative.\n[737] The Commission's submissions underlined the use of the Hay Plan, whereby the random-sampled CR positions were evaluated in accordance with the four factors of skill, effort, responsibility required in the performance of the work, and the conditions under which the work was performed, as called for in subsection 11(2) of the Act. This resulted in the range of job values for each of the CR levels.\n[738] The Commission concluded that Dr. Kervin's and Mr. Ranger's methodologies, both involving a composite male pay line, were the most appropriate. Accordingly, the Commission submitted two sets of calculations of adjustments required for each CR level to achieve equal pay for work of equal value for the years from 1981 to 2002.\n[739] The first calculation was based on Dr. Kervin's methodology using the Professional Team's evaluation job values, under which he had determined a wage gap for the year 1995. From this base year, the Commission extrapolated wage gaps for each of the other years. The second calculation was that of Mr. Ranger's whose wage gap determination by CR level by year, was based upon the methodology employed by the Professional Team.\n[740] The Commission indicated that the wage rates used in its wage adjustment calculations were based on those recorded in the relevant collective agreements. Specifically, the wage rates for the years 1981 to 1994 were those stipulated in Mr. Ranger's Report. Those for 1995 were drawn from the Professional Team's Reports. Those for the years 1996 to 2002 were taken directly from the collective agreements by the Commission, since neither the Professional Team nor Dr. Kervin provided calculations beyond 1995.\n[741] The Commission indicated that while both Dr. Kervin's and Mr. Ranger's calculations provided satisfactory estimates of the wage gap for any given year, it preferred Dr. Kervin's wage adjustment estimates. Reasons for this preference included Dr. Kervin's use of an average job value in each CR level as opposed to the average position value of Dr. Wolf's team. Also the Commission considered Dr. Kervin's calculations to be more accurate and up-to-date than those of Mr. Ranger.\n[742] The Commission acknowledged that both sets of calculations represented wage gap estimates only and the determination of actual payouts for individual CR employees must, of necessity, be subject to the examination of employee records with appropriate employer input.\n[743] While the Commission argued that tribunals do not determine total individual payouts, the Tribunal, should it find the determination of evaluated job values to be reasonably reliable, must decide which wage adjustment methodology is appropriate, given the circumstances of the case.\n[744] The Commission indicated its agreement with the Alliance's \"fold-in\" principle that, in making any back-pay adjustment, it would be folded into the CR base wage rates in its collective agreement200\n[745] The Commission was also supportive of the \"pay for all purposes\" concept and submitted that:\n...it is essential that the pay equity adjustments include not only adjustments to base salary, but also for all purposes, i.e. pensions, overtime, sick leave, acting pay, and long term disability payments.201\n[746] The Commission did, however, accept the expert evidence of Dr. Lee in concluding that there was no material difference between the non-wage compensation of CR's and PO's, based on current contracts for full-time employees. Dr. Lee had reviewed the \"historical differences\" for the previous 12 years and concluded that they could not be calculated reliably without a complete file of employee experience for each benefit provision. Where differences did exist, Dr. Lee considered them to be minor and, in most cases, without a wage equivalent value of significance for \"pay equity\" purposes. Therefore, Dr. Lee had presented his opinion that there was no overall difference in non-wage compensation that should be incorporated into the calculation of wage adjustments that would favour either the CR's or the PO's.\n[747] It was also the Commission's submission that the exclusion of the PO-SUP subgroup of jobs from the PO occupational group during both the Investigation Stage and the subsequent \"pay equity\" process, had no bearing on the reasonable reliability of the wage adjustment methodology.\n[748] The Commission urged the Tribunal to retain jurisdiction after submitting its Decision, to assist the parties as may be appropriate, in the event difficulties are encountered at a later date in determining the specifics of individual payouts.\n(iii) Canada Post [749] Canada Post submitted that the question of Remedy, including the wage adjustment methodology need not arise if the Tribunal were to decide in Canada Post's favour and dismiss the Complaint for one or more of the reasons it had already argued. However, Canada Post did choose to respond to the submissions of the Alliance and the Commission on remedial issues.\n[750] Canada Post argued that the importance of a remedial award and its impact on all parties demands a high degree of confidence in the methodology used to determine any wage adjustments. In this regard, Canada Post considered the Alliance's wage adjustment calculations to be \"exaggerated in every respect\". Canada Post estimated that based on Mr. Ranger's methodology, the total award would be approximately $2.4 billion, and approximately $443 million based on Dr. Kervin's methodology.\n[751] It was noted by Canada Post that the Alliance's submission and Mr. Ranger's calculations were based on the Professional Team's wage adjustment analysis which included development of a regression line for the male jobs by fitting a line through the PO data points manually by eye, using a ruler. The pay line was then extended beyond the range of the PO data by extrapolation which Canada Post stated was not considered an acceptable technique by the Equal Pay Division of Labour Canada.\n[752] It was Canada Post's submission that there were four significant flaws in the Professional Team's wage adjustment analysis that rendered it inadequate as a basis for calculating appropriate wage adjustments in this case.\n[753] The first flaw, in Canada Post's opinion, was the manual setting of the male pay lines. Dr. Wolf had testified that while there is a difference of opinion among statisticians as to the minimum number of observations required for the proper use of regression analysis, most regard less than 25 to 30 to be questionable. Dr. Wolf and his two colleagues had five PO-INT observations and five PO-EXT observations, derived from \"generic\" job titles. Yet, the Professional Team actually drew regression lines by hand based on this limited number of observations.\n[754] The second flaw was the exclusion by the Professional Team of one of the five observations in drawing its PO-EXT regression line which it considered to be anomalous because the job concerned was paid significantly more that the other jobs. Canada Post submitted that there may have been a more plausible reason for its exclusion. If it had been included, it might, in Canada Post's view, have demonstrated that there was no relationship between wages and job values.\n[755] The third flaw was the Professional Team's extrapolation of the PO-INT and PO-EXT pay lines which, Canada Post argued, demonstrated that the majority of the Hay point scores for the CR 2, 3, 4, and 5's fell outside the range of PO point scores. Only through extrapolation was it possible to make this comparison since there were no PO jobs that were equal in value to many of the lower value CR jobs. Accordingly, Canada Post was of the opinion that on the basis of the data collected by the Commission, it was simply not possible to make a wage adjustment for those lower value CR jobs.\n[756] The fourth flaw related to the Professional Team's selection of wage adjustment models which Canada Post considered to be unjustified. Having developed seven level-to-line pay lines and one position-matched option for only three of the years involved, Canada Post argued that with little explanation, Dr. Wolf and his two colleagues recommended the most expensive option for each of the three years. Both the Alliance and the Commission preferred the lower priced average composite PO-INT and PO-EXT option.\n[757] With respect to Mr. Ranger's analysis, Canada Post submitted that since it was based upon the Professional Team's work, the defects in the latter's reasoning and analysis were continued in Mr. Ranger's work. Further, Canada Post questioned Mr. Ranger's method of developing PO job pay lines for the years not addressed by the Professional Team, particularly where he based his pay lines on just two observation points.\n[758] Canada Post submitted that as a result of the fundamental flaws in the analysis of the Professional Team, compounded by the questionable approach of Mr. Ranger, Mr. Ranger's analysis and calculations must be rejected out of hand.\n[759] Canada Post argued that Dr. Kervin's wage adjustment methodology was also seriously defective and identified its four basic steps as follows:\nSTEP\nA male pay line was determined using regression analysis of the male-dominated PO-INT and PO-EXT jobs. An average evaluation points score value was determined for the jobs in each of the four female-dominated CR levels. Steps 1 and 2 were used to obtain a \"predicted male wage\" for each CR level. The difference between the actual hourly wage for each CR level and its \"predicted male wage\" for that CR level was determined which represented the amount of wage adjustment to be made for that CR level.\n[760] Canada Post maintained that there were six flaws in Step 1, ranging from the fact that the male pay line included one of ten PO jobs that was not male-dominated but was between 33% and 53% female (the PO-4), to the fact that Dr. Kervin constructed his pay lines and computed pay adjustments for all years in 1995 dollars only.\n[761] In Step 2, Canada Post demonstrated that, by assuming that all jobs in the same CR level 2, 3, 4, or 5, had the same \"job value\" (the average job value within that level), some difficult and even absurd anomalies resulted because of the substantial overlap of job values between CR levels. Canada Post argued that a census rather than a sample might, indeed, be necessary at the adjustments stage to ensure a fair and equitable wage adjustment.\n[762] Canada Post faulted Step 3 of Dr. Kervin's methodology for treating all the employees in PO jobs as though they were men, and all PO jobs as though they were male-dominated, even though in Canada Post's submission, neither of these assumptions were true.\n[763] Finally, Canada Post argued that Step 4 would result in all jobs in a given CR level receiving the same wage adjustment regardless of their actual job value or their actual female percentage. For example, if one particular job at the CR-2 level was not female dominated, that job would obtain the same wage adjustment as a CR-2 job that was female dominated. Canada Post alleged that only 69.1% of the CR-2 incumbents were female, and were therefore, only \"weakly\" and not \"predominantly\", female (effective year not specified). Yet, Dr. Kervin's approach would provide CR-2 jobs with the largest wage adjustment of any CR level.\n[764] Canada Post also claimed that three of the four CR levels would, under Dr. Kervin's model, receive a wage adjustment substantially in excess of what Dr. Killingsworth derived in his \"Model 1\" as the maximum difference in pay that can be attributed to gender. This was unusual, argued Canada Post, as Dr. Kervin had, when presenting his evidence, fully endorsed and accepted Dr. Killingsworth's \"Model 1\".\n[765] In conclusion, Canada Post submitted that a wage gap award based on Dr. Kervin's methodology would be seriously flawed and should be rejected by the Tribunal.\n[766] Canada Post proposed an alternative wage adjustment methodology that would, in its opinion, avoid the flaws contained in the proposals of Mr. Ranger and Dr. Kervin while furthering the objective of section 11 of the Act. The basic principles of Canada Post's wage adjustment proposal were expressed along the following lines:\nPRINCIPLE\nSince the purpose of section 11 is to eliminate sex-based wage gaps, wages would only be increased for those jobs in a CR level that are strongly female. Since section 11 requires wage adjustments only to the extent that there is unequal pay for work of equal value, adjustments should be made at the level of the job, where job value is reasonably precise. Wage adjustments should correct only for wage differences attributable to the gender make-up of the job and should only close the gap between predominantly female jobs and jobs performed by men. Wage adjustments should be made only as \"back-pay\" to compensate for past discrimination. The Alliance and Canada Post have agreed in their current collective agreement that pay rates are compliant with section 11 of the Act.\n[767] To accomplish these principles, Canada Post outlined a detailed procedure which will not be described here. Suffice it to say that the procedure included use of Dr. Killingsworth's Models 1 and 7 for each year from 1981 to 2001, and of actual PO and CR wage rates including benefits and the 6.7% \"paid lunch\" allowance for the years in which it was in effect. It also provided for determining the percentage female in each predominantly female job.202\n[768] Canada Post submitted that in the event the Tribunal ordered a wage adjustment in this case, it should direct the parties to use this approach in calculating the relevant amounts, while recognizing that the agreement of all parties would be required as how best to implement that approach.\n[769] Two other issues were addressed by Canada Post. The first related to what has been termed \"paid lunch\", which Canada Post argued was included or assumed in the calculations of Drs. Wolf and Kervin and Mr. Ranger. This gross-up of the PO wage rates by 6.7% should, in Canada Post's view, be removed. Canada Post argued that the evidence of Messrs Edward Fournier and Harold Dunstan, two of its witnesses, demonstrated that this benefit was achieved through collective bargaining and awarded on the basis of enhancing productivity. Known as \"pay for performance\", Canada Post submitted, it was clearly related to productivity and not to gender. Therefore, Canada Post argued that, because subsection 16(a) of the 1986 Guidelines indicates that a difference in wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value is justified by different performance ratings, this particular difference cannot be part of a wage gap.\n[770] The second issue was the impact on Canada Post of the collective bargaining and labour relations situation that prevailed for several years following the proclamation of the Canada Post Corporation Act in October 1981. Upon becoming a Crown Corporation, the then existing bargaining units and agents of the former Post Office Department remained in place until 1985 to assist in providing transitional stability. This, and the introduction of the federal \"6 and 5\" cost control legislation in 1982, pre-empted an early start by Canada Post on the expected reform of the collective bargaining process.\n[771] Consequently, Canada Post has now argued, in this case, that it \"cannot be fairly said to have either established or maintained wage differences before at least 1985.\"203\n[772] Canada Post took this argument one step further by referring to the fact that the Canada Labour Relations Board did not release its decision on the appropriate bargaining units structure for Canada Post until 1988 and its effect was not felt until the next round of bargaining in 1989-1992. Hence, Canada Post's following statement:\nAgain, Canada Post cannot reasonably be said to have infringed section 11 because it had no real power to participate in establishing or maintaining wages until after that time.204\n(iv) Reply Submissions of the Alliance [773] In addressing Canada Post's criticisms of the manual fitting of the male pay line, the Alliance countered that while \"the results may be somewhat less accurate\" than regression analysis, the technique used by the Professional Team had been successfully used by Mr. Willis in his Washington State Study. The Alliance also understood the Professional Team's results were extremely close to those of Dr. Kervin.\n[774] The Alliance argued that Canada Post's questioning of Mr. Ranger's work in generating PO pay lines for each year of the Complaint was \"entirely without merit.\" Mr. Ranger's calculations were derived from basic mathematical principles and precisely replicated the Professional Team's methodology.\n[775] The Alliance reiterated that when the analyses of the Professional Team and Mr. Ranger were conducted, it was only possible to compare CR positions to PO jobs. The work of both Mr. Wilson and Dr. Killingsworth made it possible for Dr. Kervin to gross-up the CR positions into CR jobs enabling him to undertake his analysis on this basis. Despite this difference, the Alliance claimed that Dr. Kervin's end results were \"strikingly similar\" to those of the Professional Team and Mr. Ranger, and in the alternative, the Alliance adopted Dr. Kervin's methodology.\n[776] The Alliance made reference to the fact that a wage increase of nearly 20% had been granted by Canada Post to CR employees in 1995\/1996 which would reduce the wage gap for the years subsequent to 1995.\n[777] With respect to Canada Post's proposed alternative wage adjustment methodology, the Alliance noted that this approach had never been advanced explicitly during the hearing and that it remained uncosted. The Alliance indicated that it adopted the submissions of the Commission regarding the inherent problems with such an approach.\n[778] The Alliance questioned Canada Post's use of subsection 16(a) of the 1986 Guidelines to justify excluding the value of the \"paid lunch\" in the calculation of PO wages on the basis of section 17 of the 1986 Guidelines. Section 17 requires that the reasonable factor invoked must be equally available to all male and female employees concerned. Canada Post failed, alleged the Alliance, to establish that performance pay was equally open to both the male comparator and the female complainant groups because the evidence before the Tribunal would indicate that CR performance pay does not exist.\n[779] The response of the Alliance to Canada Post's defences that it should not be responsible for wage discrimination under section 11 of the Act for a number of years during the 1980's was that \"[t]hese defences are unmeritorious\". While Canada Post has always maintained that there was no wage discrimination, the Alliance argued that Canada Post initially maintained and later independently established discriminatory wages between male and female employees performing work of equal value, an offence under section 11. The Alliance also argued that Canada Post could have rectified the situation by making voluntary equal pay adjustments, outside of collective agreements and without affecting base wage rates, as did the Government of Canada in the JUMI undertaking. Canada Post chose not to do so.\n[780] It was, therefore, the Alliance's submission that the specified time period during which Canada Post argued it lacked the power to establish or maintain wage differences should not be excluded from the ambit of this Complaint.\n(v) Reply Submissions of the Commission [781] The Commission acknowledged that it articulated its position on wage adjustment methodology after much of the evidence had been led. It was only after hearing the evidence of Mr. Wilson regarding the roll-up of CR positions to jobs, and having heard the expert evidence of Dr. Kervin, that the Commission felt comfortable taking a firm position on the choice of level-to-line methodology.\n[782] The Commission submitted that Canada Post had misinterpreted the wage adjustment methodology used by itself and the Alliance by claiming that both are treating the average of each CR level as a \"job\". The Commission responded by stating that its wage adjustment methodology does not treat each level as a job but averages the job values by CR level because all CR's in a given level are treated the same for pay purposes.\n[783] Canada Post's calculations of a possible total award based on Mr. Ranger's approach of approximately $2.4 billion, and of approximately $443 million based on Dr. Kervin's model, were questioned by the Commission. Neither supporting evidence indicating how the figures had been determined, nor evidence to enable one to replicate the calculations, were furnished, according to the Commission.\n[784] In response to what the Commission regarded as grossly inflated calculations by Canada Post, the Commission submitted that it had undertaken its own calculations based on Dr. Kervin's methodology. The Commission stressed that its calculations were but estimates, as the exact amounts would be dependent upon a number of factors about which information is not known at this time. Examples are: the exact number of employees at Canada Post over each of the many years of this case, their length of service, and the individual entitlements associated with \"pay for all purposes\".\n[785] Based on Mr. Wilson's reported CR population numbers and assuming a 1956.6 hour year, the Commission estimated the possible cost of correcting the CR wage gaps to be of the following order:\n(1) Using the Courts of Justice Act interest rate:\ncompounded semi-annually approximately $527.5 million\nsimple annually approximately $357.4 million\n(2) Using the Canada Savings Bonds interest rate:\ncompounded semi-annually approximately $375.2 million\nsimple annually approximately $301.1 million\n[786] The Commission cautioned that it had made what it considered to be certain reasonable assumptions and choices in arriving at these estimates, for the purpose of providing the Tribunal with a more realistic indication of potential cost implications than what had been provided to date.\n[787] The Commission submitted that Canada Post's attacks on Dr. Kervin's wage adjustment methodology can best be dismissed by addressing several key issues, as follows.\n[788] The first issue was Canada Post's flawed interpretation of section 11 of the Act and a misunderstanding or refusal to accept section 13 of the 1986 Guidelines. It would seem, argued the Commission, that Canada Post was simply opposed to the manner in which section 13 of the 1986 Guidelines determines gender predominance and preferred some other method or the use of an alternative percentage cut-off point. The Commission believed that the jurisprudence supports its approach in applying section 13 of the 1986 Guidelines.\n[789] The second issue was the use of the linear regression line. The Commission believed that Canada Post had repeatedly misunderstood the purpose of regression analysis in wage adjustment approaches. It is not, as Canada Post had argued, to \"explain\" pay, but rather to summarize the wages for the male and female groups, so that comparisons can be made \"on average\" in relation to a new measure of job value derived by means of a gender neutral job evaluation plan.\n[790] The third issue was the use of extrapolation. Contrary to Canada Post's assertion, the Commission submitted that Dr. Kervin did not question the use of extrapolation. Nor did he state that there were too few jobs to calculate a regression line for the male PO jobs. What Dr. Kervin did say was that it would be more difficult to extrapolate if the line were not linear. In this case, however, the PO pay line was linear.\n[791] The fourth issue was Canada Post's criticism of the level-to-line wage adjustment methodology which, in the Commission's opinion, provided \"on-average fairness\" within the existing CR classification structure. The Commission emphasized that one of the purposes of the level-to-line approach, as with any regression line model, is to allow wage adjustments where direct job-to-job comparisons are not feasible.\n[792] The fifth issue was a misinterpretation of the significance of Dr. Killingsworth's Model 1 as it related to the calculation of \"pay equity\" adjustments. In asserting that the level-to-line approach can produce \"absurd\" results when compared with Dr. Killingsworth's Model 1, the Commission argued that Canada Post had failed to realize that Model 1 was fundamentally different from a level-to-line model and measured a different variable. It was the Commission's position that, while Dr. Kervin acknowledged that Model 1 could show the existence of a \"pay equity\" problem, he did not accept it as suitable for determining exact wage gap adjustments.\n[793] With respect to Canada Post's own proposed alternative wage adjustment methodology, the Commission called it a \"novel approach\" but argued that, in formulating it, Canada Post had ignored or misinterpreted section 11 of the Act, the 1986 Guidelines and the case law. It appeared to the Commission to be an attempt to avoid the application of the Act and would lead to a result which would fail to advance the purpose of section 11 because it would not address systemic gender-based wage discrimination stemming from occupational segregation and the undervaluing of women's work.\n[794] The Commission questioned Canada Post's statement that its proposed methodology had been used in the past, and particularly that it had been \"widely supported,\" and argued that the source cited by Canada Post failed to substantiate this proposition. In the Commission's view, Canada Post's proposal had been neither used nor supported under any federal equal pay for work of equal value policy, nor in any Canadian jurisdiction.\n[795] The Commission argued further that since Canada Post's proposal hinges upon the use of \"percent female\" instead of the concept of \"gender predominance,\" it runs counter to what expert witnesses Drs. Armstrong and Kervin had advocated - addressing occupational segregation and the undervaluing of women's work as intended by section 11 of the Act.\n[796] Finally, the Commission remarked that it had had no opportunity to attempt to replicate Canada Post's proposed adjustment methodology, and no evidence, expert or otherwise, had been called to elaborate upon it.\n[797] In sum, the Commission submitted that the Tribunal should take an extremely cautious approach to Canada Post's wage adjustment methodological proposal and should reject it.\nC. Tribunal's Analysis (i) Preliminary [798] The Tribunal has already concluded that it is more likely than not that the reasonably reliable Hay Plan, process and job information, in the hands of the competent Professional Team, would result in reasonably reliable job evaluation values being attributed to the work performed by CR and PO employees (paragraph [703]). In determining the value of the work performed by those employees, the Professional Team applied the composite of the skill, effort and responsibility required in the performance of the work, and the conditions under which the work was performed, all in line with the requirements of subsection 11(2) of the Act.\n[799] Comparing the resulting CR and PO job evaluation values, the Professional Team found that a significant portion of the CR positions were of a value equal to or greater than that of the PO jobs. The next step was to identify whether or not there was a wage gap between the male-dominated PO jobs and the female-dominated CR positions after comparing the evaluation values and CR and PO hourly wage rates. The Professional Team concluded that there was a wage gap between CR's and PO's performing work of equal value.\n[800] Establishing a wage gap in this context is a most crucial step since it is the wage gap that evidences the discriminatory practice prohibited by section 11 of the Act. It has been said several times in this Decision that the essential purpose of section 11 is to eliminate systemic discrimination - to achieve \"pay equity\" between male and female employees employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value. It is therefore, by demonstrating a difference in wages between such male and female employees that systemic discrimination is proven under section 11, on a balance of probabilities, provided the employer has not demonstrated that the difference is attributed to one of the reasonable factors prescribed in section 16 of the 1986 Guidelines, and also provided that the methodology used in determining the wage gap meets the requirements of the Act.\n[801] The Tribunal accepts that the evidence of the Professional Team, both through the viva voce evidence of Dr. Wolf and also through the presentation of the Team's Reports to the Tribunal, is sufficient, on a balance of probabilities, to demonstrate a wage gap when the work of the predominantly female CR's was compared with the work of equal value being performed by the predominantly male PO's at Canada Post. As Mme Justice L'Heureux-Dube indicated, when she wrote of the difficulty of comparing work of equal value in the SEPQA decision:\nOne element of difficulty is the concept of equality. The prohibition against wage discrimination is part of a broader legislative scheme designed to eradicate all discriminatory practices and to promote equality in employment. In this larger context section 11 addresses the problem of the undervaluing of work performed by women. As this objective transcends the obvious prohibition against paying lower wages for strictly identical work, the notion of equality in section 11 should not receive a technical or restrictive interpretation.205\n[802] Further, the Tribunal accepts that Canada Post has not demonstrated that there was, in its personnel or wage policies, a reasonable factor prescribed in section 16 of the 1986 Guidelines which could explain this wage gap as caused by other than systemic sex discrimination.\n[803] Having accepted that there is a wage gap, and, consequently, there is proof, on a balance of probabilities, that there has been systemic discrimination in this \"pay equity\" complaint, the next step is to select the most appropriate wage adjustment methodology to use to calculate an award of lost wages and to eliminate the gap. Given the many circumstances of this case, how appropriate are the wage adjustment proposals presented herein, and is there one or more that the Tribunal finds acceptable?\n[804] To select the most appropriate wage adjustment methodology, it is helpful to be reminded of what Mr. Justice Evans said in the Treasury Board decision about the role of the Commission and the tribunal in such a choice:\nSection 11 provides only a broad legal framework within which problems of wage discrimination between men and women are to be tackled in light of the facts of the particular employment situation, the evidence of expert witnesses, and the underlying purposes of the statute. In my view it would be inconsistent with both the underlying purpose of section 11, and the legislative record, to interpret the section as impliedly prescribing with the particularity suggested by counsel for the Attorney General the characteristics of the permitted comparative methodologies. Much must inevitably be left to be decided by the Commission and the Tribunal case by case, with the assistance of experts. (emphasis added)206\n[805] The Tribunal has concluded from the evidence before it, and influenced by Mr. Justice Evans' Treasury Board decision, that testing for the appropriateness of the proposed wage adjustment methodologies is best handled in the following manner:\nAre the methodologies compatible with the purpose of the Act, its Guidelines and its remedial provisions? What expert evidence was heard and what supportive case law was identified with respect to each wage adjustment methodology? What experience has the Commission had with such or similar methodologies? Are the methodologies sufficiently compatible with how work and wages are structured and organized by the employer, so that should a Remedy be recommended, it could be implemented without undue difficulty?\n[806] The Tribunal has identified three wage adjustment methodologies that it considers deserve assessment, as follows:\nThe Professional Team\/Ranger Proposal in the PO INT - PO EXT composite version, labelled Approach E: This version was based on the Professional Team's methodology subsequently replicated by Mr. Ranger who also undertook calculations on 12 month periods; supported by the Alliance, accepted by the Commission, and found to be unacceptable by Canada Post. The Kervin\/Commission Proposal in a PO composite version: This version used the Professional Team's base material and Dr. Kervin's methodology in which he rolled up CR positions into CR jobs, courtesy of Mr. Wilson's and Dr. Killingsworth's workings; calculated by Dr. Kervin for 1995, all other years extrapolated by the Commission. Preferred option of the Commission, acceptable to the Alliance, unacceptable to Canada Post. The Canada Post Alternative Proposal. Proposed by Canada Post to avoid what it considered to be flaws in the other two proposals; presented in Canada Post's final submissions. Acceptable to Canada Post, unacceptable to the Alliance and the Commission.\n(ii) Review of the Wage Adjustment Methodology Proposals [807] Canada Post submitted that its Proposal would further the objective of section 11 of the Act by not awarding compensation where there was no demonstrated wage gap or where a wage gap was not based on sex. Wages would only be increased for those jobs in a CR level that were strongly female. Adjustments would have to be made at the level of the job where job value is reasonably precise.\n[808] However, the Commission argued that Canada Post, in developing its Proposal, had ignored or misinterpreted section 11 of the Act and the 1986 Guidelines, as well as case law, by failing to address systemic gender-based wage discrimination stemming from occupational segregation in the undervaluing of women's work.\n[809] Unfortunately, there was no expert or other evidence led by Canada Post in defence of its position. There was, however, evidence from the Alliance's expert witness, Dr. Kervin, who argued that Dr. Killingsworth's Model 1, which constituted an element of Canada Post's Proposal, was not suitable for determining exact wage gap adjustments. Indeed, because Dr. Killingsworth's methodology ignored the gender predominance requirements in the Act and the Guidelines, his Models would not, in Dr. Kervin's opinion, be appropriate for the \"pay equity\" Complaint before the Tribunal.\n[810] The Commission disputed Canada Post's statement that its proposed methodology had been used in the past and had been widely supported. It had, to the Commission's knowledge, never been used nor supported under the federal equal pay for work of equal value policy, nor in any Canadian jurisdiction.\n[811] The Tribunal notes that Canada Post's Proposal lacked any estimated costing of its possible impact as a wage adjustment approach. It was also noted that the Commission had not had an opportunity to replicate the methodology of this alternative option.\n[812] As a result, the Tribunal found it very difficult to assess this methodology vis-\u00e0-vis the other two Proposals, quite apart from attempting to put in context the many criticisms submitted by the Commission and endorsed by the Alliance. While one or two aspects of Canada Post's Proposal sparked the investigative interest of the Tribunal, it has concluded that it would be grossly unfair, not only to Canada Post, the initiator, but also to the other two parties, to attempt to make a decision about the appropriateness of a fairly complex matter, based on the very slim amount of factual evidence available and the complete absence of expert evidential input.\n[813] Under these circumstances, the Tribunal is compelled to excise the Canada Post Proposal from further consideration.\n[814] Both the Alliance and the Commission submitted that the two other Proposals, despite Canada Post's criticisms of them, were consistent with the purpose of the Act which, in line with Mr. Justice Laforest's 1987 decision in the Robichaud case, is remedial.207\n[815] The Tribunal also recognizes the importance of addressing systemic remedies when one is dealing with systemic discrimination. Remedial measures should remedy the past, present and future effects of such discrimination. As Mr. Justice Dickson, then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, pronounced in 1987 \"statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained ... [and] the purpose of the [Canadian Human Rights] Act is ... to prevent discrimination\".208 After a lengthy discussion of systemic discrimination and the methods necessary to combat it, the Chief Justice concluded that \"it is essential to look to the past patterns of discrimination and to destroy those patterns in order to prevent the same type of discrimination in the future\".209\n[816] In 1996, Mr. Justice Hugessen noted that there was a \"presumption that systemic discrimination will have produced the same effects in the past as it does in the present, although that presumption clearly becomes weaker the further it is extended into the past\".210\n[817] The Tribunal accepts the Commission's argument that while wage adjustment methodology can be a fairly technical matter, its real purpose is to operationalize equality under section 11 of the Act and it should, therefore, not receive a restrictive, overly technical interpretation. Complementing the goal of equality is the discretionary non-prescriptive remedial authority of the Tribunal under subsection 53(2) of the Act. The scope of the Tribunal's remedial jurisdiction is, therefore, not only discretionary but also broadly based in all of the circumstances concerned.\n[818] In this case, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Durber, an early Commission expert witness, who dealt with the concept of \"on-average fairness\" as a determinative factor when dealing with the concept of \"pay equity\". He made the pertinent point that one is not dealing with one-to-one, job-to-job comparisons in seeking wage equality when large organizations and large numbers of employees are involved, but rather with employee group comparisons that provide \"on-average fairness\".\n[819] To put Mr. Durber's comments about \"on-average fairness\" in context, it is helpful to refer to his testimony in May 1993. During his direct evidence, while he was explaining why it was not feasible to do a job-to-job comparison, Mr. Durber pointed out that \"averaging means that there are jobs whose values are higher than that mean and jobs whose values are lower\".211\n[820] Additionally, Mr. Durber concluded that there were reasons why individual job-to-job comparisons were neither practical nor even desirable, in this particular case:\nFairness on average will end up with a system that is fair on average, that when one is designing a remedy, one probably cannot afford to design a remedy for all individuals because you are dealing with a systemic issue in which you are trying to see if whole structures ought to be adjusted on some reasonable basis. (emphasis added)212\n[821] Indeed, the Commission's booklet \"Implementing Pay Equity in the Federal Jurisdiction\" referred to in earlier sections of this Decision (Exhibit HR-1), identified the \"wage line approach\" which presents job values and wages for employees in male-dominated jobs on an average wage line. The Tribunal accepts that the level-to-line approach is appropriate for a \"pay equity\" case such as this Complaint, and notes that both Proposals under review supported the composite PO level-to-line male wage line approach.\n[822] The Tribunal is cognizant that the Treasury Board case, in which the Commission was actively engaged, involved considerable evidence from expert witnesses called to give opinions concerning the selection of an acceptable wage adjustment methodology.213 The tribunal in that case favoured a level-to-segment methodology after hearing from at least four witnesses with significant expertise in the subject matter.\n[823] The Tribunal accepts that the two Proposals recognize that the wage adjustment device should be crafted in such a way that it can be implemented at the level in the organization at which the wage inequality manifests itself. In the current case, it is a question of adjusting the pay rates for the different CR classification levels because the goal of section 11 is to remedy discrimination within the existing job classification system of Canada Post. This will enable male predominant and female predominant employees, performing work of equal value in the same establishment, to receive equal pay.\n[824] Both Proposals have relied, understandably, on certain core evaluation material generated by the Professional Team, the job information for which was categorized by the Tribunal as being of \"lower reasonable reliability\". Additionally, there has continued to be a question of how representative the CR sample was, in fact, given the different opinions of Drs. Kervin and Bellhouse. Dr. Kervin considered the sample to be sufficiently representative to provide adequate representation at each CR level for use in his methodology.\n[825] With regard to the \"paid lunch\" issue, the evidence before the Tribunal was that the PO wage rates used in the calculations of the Professional Team, and of Dr. Kervin and Mr. Ranger, reflected the 6.7% additional value.214 A similar addition to the CR wage rates was not applied, as \"paid lunch\" is not applicable to the CR employees. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that no evidence was presented to support Canada Post's argument that the value of \"paid lunch\" should be excluded under subsection 16(a) of the 1986 Guidelines as a \"pay for performance\" provision, which would require equal applicability to both the PO and CR employees under section 17 of the 1986 Guidelines.\n[826] There does, however, appear to be some disparity between what Canada Post called for in its own Alternative Proposal and what it submitted about the Professional Team\/Ranger and Kervin\/Commission Proposals, insofar as the \"paid lunch\" issue is concerned. The evidence indicated that a \"paid lunch\" allowance was included for PO employees for the years it was in effect in Canada Post's Proposal, but was questioned by Canada Post when included in the other two Proposals.215\n[827] Mr. Ranger and Dr. Kervin, and the Commission, all cautioned that their respective calculations have resulted in estimates only. Additional work will be required to achieve final costing of individual adjustments per CR employee after having access to employee records in consultation with Canada Post.\n[828] Mr. Ranger made particular reference to his best estimates of employee population data which were taken at one point in time and were assumed to be all full-time employees. He also indicated he had used maximum wage rates throughout his calculations.\n(iii) Sum-up [829] Determining the most appropriate wage adjustment methodology upon which to apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value enacted by Parliament in section 11 of the Act and sections 13 and 14 of the 1986 Guidelines, has not been an easy task. In the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal has examined the available methodology options presented by the Parties by means of the four eligibility criteria identified in paragraph [805] - that is, consistency with the purpose and remedial provisions of the Act and with its Guidelines; reference to expert opinions and case law; reference to Commission experience; and compatibility with the employer's work and wage structures.\n[830] The Tribunal has identified three alternative wage adjustment methodology options that it has accepted for consideration. It has examined all three against the four eligibility criteria.\n[831] Given the complexity of the subject matter, the Tribunal concluded that the assistance of experts familiar with \"pay equity\" and wage adjustment methodology was of particular importance in its consideration of each option, not only in terms of helping the Tribunal to understand the nature of each wage adjustment methodology, but also in terms of contextualizing each methodology while interpreting the purpose and principles of the Act and its Guidelines.\n[832] Despite the Tribunal's interest in studying, further, Canada Post's Alternative Proposal, it was found to be based on very little factual evidence and the complete absence of expert evidential input. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal concluded that it was not a viable option for this case.\n[833] The Tribunal found that each of the two remaining options - the Professional Team\/Ranger Proposal and the Kervin\/Commission Proposal meet, on a balance of probabilities, the four eligibility criteria and can, therefore, be considered appropriate wage adjustment methodologies for this case.\n[834] The Tribunal, however, does not accept as conclusive the monetary values provided by the parties and witnesses for each of the two Proposals. The Commission and the Alliance, as well as the expert and other witnesses canvassed, have cautioned that their respective calculations are only estimates requiring additional work to achieve final costing of individual CR employee adjustments.\n[835] Access to individual employee records in consultation with Canada Post will be necessary. Additionally, a number of variables may require detailed review. These may include the actual employee populations and their full time or part time status, the various wage rates used and their sources, and the individual employee entitlements for \"pay for all purposes\".\n[836] Since the two Proposals meet the four eligibility criteria, and ignoring the cost implications of each, either of the two could be considered as appropriate wage adjustment methodologies for this case, subject to the additional work mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\n[837] Which of the two is preferable? The Commission urged that the Tribunal accept the Kervin\/Commission Proposal as \"jobs\" were used as the basis for its conclusions. More up-to-date information was also included in that Proposal.\n[838] Dr. Kervin commented extensively on the necessity, in \"pay equity\" cases, that the notion of systemic discrimination be a foundation for decisions made. He indicated that an allegation of systemic discrimination, in the \"pay equity\" context, demanded a close scrutiny of \"jobs\" in the organization involved.\n[839] This commentary reflects very much that of Dr. Pat Armstrong, who had introduced the Tribunal to the concept of \"pay equity\". She, too, had underlined the necessity to concentrate on \"jobs\" rather than on individuals, to see the concept of \"pay equity\" as a natural evolution of the history of business philosophy.\n[840] As Dr. Kervin observed:\nPay equity is about systemic discrimination. It is about discrimination decisions that are not made on a one-to-one basis, but rather are inherent as part of the view of how an organization approaches jobs and their compensation. That is part of the reason it moves beyond equal pay for the same work, which would deal with non-systemic discrimination; in other words, discrimination targeted to some specific individual: \"I don't like your mouth, so I am going to make sure you don't get paid as much\".\nIn this case, we are talking about decisions that are made about jobs and the content of jobs and the important thing - and one of the reasons I believe the focus is on jobs rather than positions is that you want those decisions to be about work content.\nIf pay equity deals with decisions about work content and the value of that work content to organizations, then you can see that the decision takes place when you think about the job.\nIf there are no jobs, then it will take place at the level of the position. But there one has to be careful to make sure that the characteristics of the incumbent - height, eye colour, race, whether or not he or she is bald, those kinds of things - don't enter into the decision-making. Those are discriminatory behaviours of a different sort.\nWith pay equity, it's jobs of equal work. The job itself in terms of how much it's worth to the organization ought to be paid fairly based on that worth to the organization.216\n[841] Therefore, Dr. Kervin took from both Mr. Wilson's and Dr. Killingsworth's work their aggregation of the CR positions to create \"jobs\" with the characteristics of those positions rated by the Professional Team. Their work converted the 194 CR positions into a number of jobs by combining the information on all the positions into \"some jobs\". Dr. Kervin described this work as \"aggregat[ing] the ratings of the positions into ratings of jobs\" (Exhibit HR-93A).\n[842] Using these jobs, according to Dr. Kervin, one can create a comparison of the PO jobs and the CR jobs, using a level-to-line technique, and from that comparison, determine how to close the wage gap.\n[843] The male wage line is created, according to Dr. Kervin, by observing the wage data and the Hay points for the male-dominated PO jobs. Then, the \"mean\" or \"average\" value for each CR level can be calculated by using the information for the CR \"jobs\". The question then becomes, \"what would the wage at the CR level be if the jobs in that category were paid according to the male wage line?\" This new \"female\" wage is the wage necessary to close the gap.\n[844] This emphasis on \"jobs\" is important to the concept of \"pay equity\". Based upon this ability to deal positively with the concept of closing the wage gap, while using information about the respective \"jobs\" involved, the Tribunal prefers the Kervin\/Commission Proposal.\n[845] The exclusion of statutory payments (\"pay for all purposes\") from the calculations in both Proposals is the subject of the next Section of this Decision entitled Non-Wage Forms of Compensation.\nVIII. Non-Wage Forms of Compensation A. Background [846] The provisions of the Act pertinent to this Section of the Decision are found in subsections 11(1) and 11(7) of the Act, which have already been identified in the Decision but are restated, below, for ease of reference:\nEqual wages\n11(1) It is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value. (emphasis added)\nDefinition of \"wages\"\n11(7) For the purposes of this section, \"wages\" means any form of remuneration payable for work performed by an individual and includes\n(a) salaries, commissions, vacation pay, dismissal wages and bonuses;\n(b) reasonable value of board, rent, housing and lodging;\n(c) payments in kind;\n(d) employer contributions to pension funds or plans, long-term disability plans and all forms of health insurance plans; and\n(e) any other advantage received directly or indirectly from the individual's employer. (emphasis added)\n[847] For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal notes that two terms have been used, somewhat interchangeably, in the evidence and the testimony to address the subject at hand. One is the term non-wage forms of compensation, the title of this Section of the Decision. The other is pay for all purposes.\n[848] Non-wage forms of compensation, sometimes also called in the evidence \"non-wage benefits\", \"indirect compensation\", \"indirect wages\", \"indirect remuneration\", or even \"non-cash wages\" or \"non-cash remuneration\", is the term that has arisen most frequently to include all forms of compensation itemized in subsection 11(7) of the Act, other than base wage or salary.\n[849] Pay for all purposes seems to have been used primarily in the context of Remedy. For example, in being questioned by Canada Post counsel whether or not Canada Post would have to make statutory remittances on any wage adjustments from a wage gap on items such as employment insurance, health tax, or pensions, Mr. Ranger responded, as follows:\nA. It is certainly my view that the equal pay adjustments on the new rates are pay for all purposes.\nQ. So that would include, in your view, making statutory remittances to any pertinent statute?\nA. Yes.217\n[850] Another example is the Commission's use of the term on page 187 (Chapter 13) of its Submissions, as follows:\nThus, a pay for all purposes remedy will account for the reality that any benefit which is linked to the base salary will be likewise affected by any wage rate adjustments.\n[851] In effect, the Tribunal is examining the question of \"indirect compensation\" at two levels. The first level is the impact of the non-base salary elements specified in subsection 11(7) on the definition of \"wages\". The second level is the inclusion in any wage gap adjustments, not only adjustments to the base salary or direct wage, but also to the non-salary elements, as may be appropriate.\n[852] Presumably, this becomes an issue only if the non-salary elements have not been costed, and therefore, not included in the employer's definition of \"wages\". If they have been costed and included in \"wages\", their value will be reflected in any resulting wage adjustments. The employer will, understandably, have to deduct from an individual employee's gross wage adjustment such items as relevant income tax and incremental pension plan contributions. The employer will have, however, an additional liability in terms of making remittances against any wage adjustments that may be required under statutory-based non-salary obligations which are jointly supported by employee and employer, such as pension plan contributions.\n[853] It is important to note that in determining that there was a `wage gap' as described in the preceding Section of this Decision, the Professional Team's analysis relied on the base \"direct wages\" of the CR positions and PO jobs which did not include the non-wage benefits. The Commission, in undertaking its job evaluations during the Investigation Stage of the Complaint, had not specifically costed the non-wage benefits.\n[854] All parties did acknowledge, however, that non-wage compensation, within the meaning of subsection 11(7) of the Act, must be considered in an equal pay complaint. Indeed, the Alliance engaged, in 1995, an expert resource in the person of Dr. Don Lee, to address the costing of these components for the 12-year period of 1983 to 1995. His Report is the subject of review later in this Section of the Decision.\nB. Submissions of the Parties (i) The Commission's Position [855] The Commission's Final Investigation Report, dated January 24, 1992, included the following sentence in paragraph 58:\nThere appears on balance to be a wage gap in non-cash remuneration insofar as the available evidence indicates.\n[856] Mr. Paul Durber, giving his evidence-in-chief in June 1993, was asked by Commission counsel to elaborate on that statement in the Final Investigation Report. The following comments were included in his response:\nWe will recall from some of the earlier evidence that section 11, of course, requires that we look not only at salaries but all forms of remuneration. That is, what is referred to here as non-cash wages, indirect remuneration.218\n[857] When asked by Commission counsel what effect such non-cash remuneration would have on the alleged wage gap, Mr. Durber responded as follows:\nIt would appear on balance to enlarge the gap somewhat. It is difficult to say by how much. We know that non-cash remuneration accounts for the smaller portion of total remuneration - that is, perhaps 30 per cent - and we know that much of that 30 per cent in turn is driven by direct wages...\n(...)\nSo we don't have all the evidence. We know this investigation is incomplete on that score. We have not been able to get the information and we draw a very general conclusion that there may be an additional wage gap. We don't think that indirect or non-cash remuneration will reduce the gap...219\n[858] In its final written submission, the only reference the Commission appears to have made to non-wage compensation is an indirect one, in the context of wage adjustment methodology, when it stated as follows:\n...it is essential that the pay equity adjustments include not only adjustments to base salary, but also for all purposes, i.e. pensions, overtime, sick leave, acting pay, and long term disability payments.\n(...)\nPay for all purposes will ensure that all necessary adjustments are made in respect of all pay-related benefits and premiums. As a result, entitled employees should be compensated in respect of any monetary benefit which has a nexus to the base wage rate.220\n(ii) The Alliance's Position [859] The Alliance called Dr. Don Lee as a witness before the Tribunal in October 1995. He was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in contract analysis and non-wage compensation valuation.\n[860] Dr. Lee obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968 from the University of Waterloo and his Master of Arts in political science from Queen's University. He later studied under a Canada Council Fellowship at the London School of Economics from which he was awarded a Ph.D. in political studies in 1980. He began his career as an Actuarial Assistant with a competitor of the Hay organization, handling the calculations associated with pension plan valuations, work which was compatible with his earlier mathematical studies at the undergraduate level. Subsequently, he served as Assistant Director of Research and Legislation with the Canadian Labour Congress and was engaged in the development of pension plan benefits policy and the provision of technical advice to unions in bargaining with respect to pension plans and other benefits such as retirement health insurance coverage. In the period of 1977-1978, he was contracted by the Ontario Federation of Labour to coordinate its participation in the Ontario Royal Commission on Pensions. Dr. Lee has been operating as an independent consultant since 1979. His firm, Union Pension Services Ltd., focuses on two principal aspects of retirement pensions and related benefits: firstly, providing technical support to unions at the bargaining table and secondly, offering education and training to union members. Dr. Lee's clients have included unions in many prominent Canadian industries and several Ontario public sector unions.\n[861] Dr. Lee stated that he had been contracted by the Alliance in June 1995 to compare the non-wage forms of compensation of the CR group and the PO EXT and PO INT sub-groups, for the lifetime of the Complaint from August 1983 to the summer of 1995. He indicated that he had examined a variety of federal government benefit plans and certain consultants' reports on non-wage compensation. He also reviewed 14 collective agreements covering this period of time for the CR and PO employees concerned. Dr. Lee's Report has been designated as Exhibit PSAC-55.\n[862] Dr. Lee reported that he had been instructed by the Alliance to exclude from his study those benefits provided for in paragraph 15(1)(f) of the Act. These are benefits which are provided but that provision is not deemed to be a discriminatory practice. Paragraph 15(1)(f) reads, as follows:\n15 (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if....\n(f) an employer, employee organization or employer organization grants a female employee special leave or benefits in connection with pregnancy or child-birth or grants employees special leave or benefits to assist them in the care of their children.\n[863] In comparing the individual non-wage compensation provisions of the CR and PO groups, Dr. Lee determined where differences existed between the two groups and then calculated the value of those differences in wage-equivalent terms. To maintain a consistent framework, he classified some 51 non-wage provisions into 9 general categories of compensation.\n[864] Dr. Lee stated that, in undertaking his study for the Alliance, he accepted the principle (which he understood the Commission also endorsed) that a determination of equality of non-wage compensation should be simple and workable for employers and comprehensible for employees. Therefore, recognizing the difficulty of being precise about valuating certain non-wage compensatory components, he considered differences representing less than 1\/10th of 1 % of wages not to be significant. Individual differences of this order were, therefore, not reflected in Dr. Lee's comparison calculations.\n[865] Dr. Lee indicated that his detailed valuation analysis was confined to the non-wage compensation provisions included in the then-current collective bargaining agreements. He was, therefore, dealing with those agreements in effect in the summer of 1995, which concerned the full-time CR and PO employees.\n[866] Dr. Lee confirmed, when giving his evidence, that his Report did not include, in his list of non-wage compensation items, the provision of uniforms and protective clothing for the PO employees which clearly favoured that group. He also did not include a provision for job security\/technological change.\n[867] Dr. Lee did, however, undertake a general review of what he called \"historical differences\" arising from collective agreements that were in effect from 1983 to 1994. His general review revealed that many of the \"historical differences\" were minor. Many more were temporary and were subsequently eliminated through the normal process of collective bargaining. He decided, therefore, that it was not feasible to calculate wage-equivalent values for such differences without a complete file of employee experience with each of the compensating provisions over the twelve-year period.\n[868] The last paragraph of page 21 of Dr. Lee's Report reads as follows:\nAnd finally, wherever any judgment enters directly into a calculation, I have attempted to overstate the value of the differences favouring the CR group and to understate the value of differences favouring the PO group.\n[869] Dr. Lee illustrated the meaning of this point by citing an example where he was in doubt whether or not to classify a particular CR non-wage benefit provision as being equivalent to or better than the companion PO provision. Where he had to make a judgement call, he sought to classify the current CR provision as being better for the complainant group than the current PO provision was for the comparator group.\n[870] Should his judgement call be questioned, he said he would be able to claim that he had erred on the side of underestimating the value of the specific benefit that favoured the CR group. He went on to say that \"this is a sort of general principle of actuarial practice: when in doubt, make an assumption which tends to favour the opposite of your conclusion\".221\n[871] Dr. Lee concluded from his study that, based on the then-current 1995 collective bargaining agreements in effect with full-time CR and PO employees concerned, there were essentially no differences in non-wage compensation between the two groups of employees.\n[872] Specifically, he indicated as follows:\nThe essential point, I think, is that the overwhelming body of non-wage compensation provisions are currently the same or equivalent, and the extent to which they are the same or equivalent represents something like 34 per cent of wages.222\n[873] He further concluded that there were no reasonable grounds for calculating differences in non-wage compensation for the two employee groups for the period 1983 to 1994 since any differences that were identified were relatively minor and often temporary. Moreover, a reliable calculation of the value of differences would require intensive study of employee experience for each of the compensatory provisions, over the twelve-year period.\n[874] Accordingly, Dr. Lee concluded that there were no differences in non-wage compensation between full-time CR and PO employees that should be considered in determining if there were any \"differences in wages\" under subsection 11(1) of the Act.\n(iii) Canada Post's Position [875] Canada Post called Mr. Robert Bass as a witness in April 2000, and he was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in costing compensation.\n[876] Mr. Bass obtained his extended honours Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computers in 1974 from the University of Waterloo, under its co-op alternating classroom\/workplace program. He began his career with the Toronto Board of Education where his primary responsibility was to support the Board's teachers' collective bargaining team, particularly with respect to complex costing issues. He became Director - Research and Information for the Ontario Hospital Association in 1977 where he developed a fully functioning research department whose role was to provide research and data support to the bargaining teams of member hospitals. Mr. Bass developed a computer-based total compensation-costing model for the Association, tracking wages and other compensatory clauses in hospital collective agreements. In the early 1980's, Mr. Bass set up his own consulting firm, known more currently as Bass Associates Ltd., providing a full range of labour relations support to management clients in the public sectors in Ontario, Alberta and B.C. Clients have included a broad range of providers in fields of service such as education, health, policing, and retirement homes. Mr. Bass specializes in providing employers with the costing and database analysis that is particularly crucial to management in the collective bargaining process. Since the passing of Ontario's Pay Equity Act in 1987, Mr. Bass and his associates have become increasingly engaged in developing with clients, gender neutral pay equity plans, often province-wide, requiring the involvement of both employers and unions. Inevitably, such plans demand an accurate assessment of the total value of compensation packages (wages and non-wage benefits) for comparison purposes in the context of the collective bargaining process.\n[877] Mr. Bass indicated in his evidence that it is not unusual for \"costing\" to be a major issue in addressing wage and non-wage benefits in collective bargaining negotiations. He testified that it is important for both the employer and the union\/employees concerned to know the cost of particular demands that arise in negotiations. It is acutely important for the employer to have this information, as it is the employer who must ensure that the business has the ability to carry all costs negotiated.\n[878] When one is dealing with collective bargaining situations, according to Mr. Bass, there is often a requirement that the parties to negotiations develop a total compensation-costing model for both wages and non-wage benefits. This model must address the cost of existing wage and non-wage benefits for a base year, and then cost precisely the improved or diminished benefits for the years being negotiated.\n[879] This requirement for precision, according to Mr. Bass's evidence, may entail the use of data retrieval techniques, identification of assumptions, and computer simulation modelling to gather and analyse pertinent employee usage and other information for each benefit. Of critical importance in such valuations is the modelling of the rate of expected change and the cost of such change to the employer.\n[880] Mr. Bass confirmed that his mandate from Canada Post was to review and critique Dr. Lee's Report and \"...to look at its methods, assumptions and methodology and give my comments\".223 Mr. Bass's Report has been identified as Exhibit R-547.\n[881] Mr. Bass's critique of Dr. Lee's Report faulted it on several grounds.\n[882] First, Mr. Bass indicated that Dr. Lee made a methodological error by basing his analysis on the then-current 1995 non-wage compensation provisions. Mr. Bass stated that he would have used 1983 as his base year because he would have been looking for the differences in non-wage benefits from the time the Complaint was filed.\n[883] Second, Mr. Bass disagreed with Dr. Lee's decision to dismiss individual differences in non-wage benefits of less than 1\/10th of 1% on the grounds that the sum of a large number of small numbers can equal a large number. Mr. Bass would have included such differences in his analysis.\n[884] Third, Mr. Bass was not in agreement with Dr. Lee's exclusion of job security from his analysis and referred to Dr. Lee's response to the question of job security as a benefit which he \"...[had] not been able to attach any wage equivalent value to...\".224 Mr. Bass said that, in his experience, job security was one of the principal issues in collective bargaining. He added that it had such import in collective bargaining that it often became the basis for trade-offs in the negotiating process. In this case, Mr. Bass indicated that the generous job security provisions in Canada Post's union agreements meant that it was important to cost job security. He believed that it could be costed and identified several basic steps for doing so.\n[885] Fourth, Mr. Bass challenged the exclusion of non-wage benefits arising from paragraph 15(1)(f) of the Act. Although Mr. Bass acknowledged that Dr. Lee was following the direction given to him by the Alliance when he did not address these non-wage benefits, he indicated that the items excluded should have been costed. He based this opinion, again, on the fact that these items are often major issues in collective bargaining and, as such, should be deserving of valuation. This opinion was refined somewhat when Mr. Bass indicated that he would, at least, cost those benefits which go beyond minimum employment standards. He indicated that such benefits as paternity leave and leave for family responsibilities might be examples of non-wage benefits which are not sufficiently widespread to be considered to fall within the realm of minimum employment standards.\n[886] Mr. Bass concluded that each of the four faults described above could, individually, distort the valuation of the non-wage forms of compensation applicable to the employee groups involved in this case. He considered all four faults to be \"fatal flaws\" in Dr. Lee's analysis, thereby rendering the results of his work as unreliable.\n(iv) Tribunal's Analysis [887] There is no dispute among the parties about the intent of subsection 11(7) of the Act. It defines what is meant by \"wages\", and includes therein those forms of non-wage compensation specifically identified in addition to the remuneration paid for work performed by individual employees. All parties also recognize that paragraph 11(7)(e) calls for \"any other advantage received directly or indirectly from the individual's employer\" to be included in the definition of \"wages\".\n[888] As well, there is probably no dispute among the parties about applying a \"pay for all purposes\" Remedy, should one be called for. While Canada Post does not appear to have used the expression \"pay for all purposes\" in its submissions, it was, as noted earlier, used by the Alliance's witness, Mr. Ranger, in response to a question from Canada Post counsel.\n[889] The Federal Court of Appeal, in its decision of March 18, 2004 in the `Airlines Case', reinforced what it called this \"very broadly\" defined term of \"wages\".225\n[890] The Commission's investigation reached the very general conclusion that there was likely an addition to the wage gap between the CR complainant and the PO comparator groups when one took into consideration the non-wage benefits, or indirect remuneration. Although it offered no direct evidence of such, it did not think that the non-wage remuneration would reduce the wage gap in direct remuneration between the comparator and the complainant groups.\n[891] The Alliance's position was that there was no difference in value in non-wage compensation between the CR and the PO employee groups. This position was underlined by the Report of Dr. Lee which was based upon the collective bargaining agreements in effect in 1995 with full-time CR and PO employees. A review of the \"historical differences\" between 1983 and 1994 led to Dr. Lee's conclusion that there were relatively minor and often temporary differences in value of non-wage compensation between the two groups for that period.\n[892] Canada Post presented its position that Dr. Lee's Report was flawed and, therefore unreliable through the evidence of its witness, Mr. Bass. His evidence was a critique of the Lee Report, and offered no determination of valuations or comparisons of values of the non-wage compensation components of the employee groups. Rather, he indicated to the Tribunal that the flaws identified could have led to a deviation or a distortion in the results of Dr. Lee's work.\n[893] As always, the Tribunal must consider reliability in the context of the circumstances involved in the Complaint and will use the standard of reasonableness, based on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\n[894] As already noted, having been accepted as an expert in contract analysis and non-wage compensation valuation, Dr. Lee's mandate was to determine and compare the value of the non-wage elements of compensation for the CR and PO employee groups.\n[895] Dr. Lee noted that, from the inception of the Complaint to 1995, when he delivered his Report, there had been 13 collective agreements involving Canada Post and the Alliance and the unions representing the PO's. The PO group was first represented by LCUC which later merged with CUPW. Four agreements of the 13 involved Canada Post and LCUC.\n[896] Dr. Lee's main area of scrutiny was the current (1995) collective bargaining agreement for each of the complainant and the comparator groups. Although he was aware of the prior agreements, information was not available for certain non-wage benefits for some years, and sometimes it was simply not existent at all. For those benefits he could compare in prior years, he noted that the differences were minor over the years, and often were temporary.\n[897] For the current (1995) period, Dr. Lee examined 51 provisions of the collective agreements involving the CR's and the PO's. He excluded eight provisions entirely and two partially pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(f) of the Act, as requested by the Alliance. Of the 41 remaining provisions, he classified 24 as giving the same or an equivalent non-wage benefit to each group. An additional eight provisions had had differences in past agreements but were currently the same or equivalent.\n[898] Eight provisions favoured one or other of the CR's or PO's. Six favoured the PO group and two, the CR group. Dr. Lee had been instructed by the Alliance that, when in doubt, he should choose the option that would reduce any wage gap. He had tried to do this, as he noted, (paragraphs [868]-[870]) using his principle of actuarial practice \"to favour the opposite of your conclusion\".\n[899] Based upon his comparison of the collective bargaining agreements and his calculations of the values of the individual benefits, Dr. Lee concluded that there was no substantial difference between non-wage compensation for the two groups with the exception of the uniforms and protective clothing allowance for the PO group, which he estimated \"may amount to as much as 2.08% of wages\".\n[900] As noted earlier, Canada Post's expert in the costing of compensation, Mr. Bass, was mandated to critique the work of Dr. Lee. He was not asked to determine and compare the value of the non-wage compensation components of both employee groups.\n[901] Mr. Bass faulted Dr. Lee's Report on several grounds and concluded that each fault identified could have changed Dr. Lee's conclusion by distorting the valuation of the non-wage forms of compensation.\n[902] Mr. Bass indicated that the choice of year is critical when doing a comparative analysis of non-wage compensation, as the year chosen will be the basis for future collective bargaining and eventual agreement. In this case, he noted that the year the complaint was brought would have been a better choice. Mr. Bass would have liked to have been able to see clearly the changes in cost of the non-wage compensation as the years unfolded from 1983 to 1995, and, thereby, make note of what Dr. Lee called minor or transitory differences in order to come to a definitive conclusion.\n[903] Mr. Bass did admit that he understood that information for certain non-wage benefits was either not readily available or not available at all for all the years concerned. In other cases, an automated capacity was not available, necessitating a manual and more expensive means of data retrieval. He stated that, while his methodology depended upon obtaining accurate data, it was not uncommon to encounter situations where employers felt they could not provide suitable data. In such circumstances, he believed that one had to probe deeper, and perhaps deal with employer representatives who are close to the working operation. In terms of voluminous manual records, Mr. Bass stated that he might be prepared to work with a reasonable sample size, provided he could be assured that he would get representative data.\n[904] The Tribunal finds that Mr. Bass's first criticism of Dr. Lee's work relating to his selection of the base year of 1995 rather than 1983 has merit as a theoretical statement of the most suitable year to begin the analysis of non-wage compensation differences between groups. In the circumstances, however, this cannot be given such weight as to overcome the work on the available 1995 data. There was a lack of certain information. Other information was not readily available. Dr. Lee, a witness being called by the Alliance to give evidence at the Tribunal hearing, could not simply ask a representative of the Respondent, Canada Post, to supply information to him. Even if he had been able to do so, subsequent evidence demonstrated that some of that information was not available.\n[905] Mr. Bass's second criticism related to Dr. Lee's decision to dismiss differences in value of non-wage compensation benefits of less than 1\/10th of 1%. Although the Tribunal understands Mr. Bass's point about the possible total cost of a series of individual benefits with less than 1\/10th of 1% difference, he gave no concrete evidence to illustrate what impact this might have on the definition of wages.\n[906] Therefore, the Tribunal does not give significant weight to this second alleged fault in Dr. Lee's Report.\n[907] Dr. Lee and Mr. Bass disagreed about the ability to evaluate a benefit such as \"job security\", Mr. Bass's third area of concern. While Dr. Lee identified job security as an employee-benefitting category of non-wage compensation, he concluded that there were not reasonable means of attaching a wage-equivalent value to such a benefit, as it depends on future usage which cannot be reliably predicted.\n[908] Mr. Bass disagreed. He felt that the costing of job security was particularly important in industries where technological change is prevalent, such as in postal operations. He did, however, note that to cost such a benefit would require access to appropriate employee data such as the number of employees actually or potentially at risk of being declared surplus, the time elements involved, and other related factors.\n[909] While both expert witnesses acknowledged that job security is a non-wage benefit, it is evident, under the circumstances of this case, that Dr. Lee did not have access to the necessary information to undertake a costing, however approximate, of its value. Nor was the timing of his study propitious in the midst of the current hearing.\n[910] Given the nebulous nature of costing job security and the credibility of both witnesses in their respective fields of expertise, the Tribunal accepts that job security is probably one of those non-wage benefits that is likely to be of equivalent value to virtually all of the CR and PO employees. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that this could be particularly so in an industry where technological change is prevalent, such as a modern postal collection, processing and delivery organization.\n[911] Finally, Mr. Bass indicated that a thorough comparison of value of non-wage compensation for the CR's and the PO's would necessitate the valuation of the various provisions excluded by Dr. Lee. They concern primarily leave, with or without pay, for maternity, paternity and adoption, as well as leave for family responsibilities or for parental needs.\n[912] These provisions arise under paragraph 15(1)(f) of the Act and represent benefits which are deemed by the Act not to be discriminatory. For this reason, Dr. Lee testified that he had been instructed by the Alliance to exclude them from his analysis.\n[913] Mr. Bass stated that he would have costed the paragraph 15(1)(f) benefits - or at least, those that were above the minimum employment standards. He said that it was not usually regarded as an achievement in collective bargaining circles to negotiate only up to employment standards. It would, however, be an achievement to negotiate and succeed with benefits that go beyond those standards and, therefore, vital to know the costed value of the benefits.\n[914] In the circumstances of Dr. Lee's Report, Mr. Bass admitted that such a costed valuation would be impossible without the availability of the usage data for each of the benefits which he did not have. Therefore, Dr. Lee's acceptance of his instruction to exclude the provisions which fell under paragraph 15(1)(f) of the Act was understandable given the nature of the Complaint, the clear wording of the paragraph, and the unavailability of the necessary data.\n[915] Similarly, without an ability to make a costed valuation, Mr. Bass's comment that a majority of the paragraph 15(1)(f) provisions appeared to favour the CR group was sheer supposition.226\n[916] Nor was Dr. Lee above making a supposition concerning provisions which he was unable to value or which he believed were part of Canada Post's administrative practice. He commented, as follows, on benefits such as Career Development Leave with Pay, and Examination Leave with Pay, both of which were available to CR employees for many years prior to 1995 when the PO group negotiated their availability for its group:\n...I find it difficult to imagine that Canada Post would not have allowed POs time off for important examinations up until their most recent contract.\nI suspect that in the case of some of these differences, that there have been administrative management practices ... which have been in place, perhaps, for years but were never written into the contract...227\n[917] Neither expert's supposition had a basis in the evidence heard by the Tribunal.\n[918] The Report of Dr. Lee, however, does present the picture of the value of the non-wage compensation available to the complainant and comparator groups as being, more likely than not, of equivalent value and tied, in a negotiated pattern, to the value of the wages paid to the two groups.\n[919] The critique of Mr. Bass has not persuaded the Tribunal that Dr. Lee's Report should be rejected. Indeed, it has underlined the need for availability of data and materials in order to do more precise work. In the circumstances of this Complaint, the ability to be more precise was substantially reduced because of a lack of suitable data necessary to that precision. This lack of precision is a long way, however, from stating that the evidence presented by Dr. Lee's Report cannot be accepted as proving, on a balance of probabilities, that it is more likely than not that the non-wage compensation of both the complainant and the comparator groups was generally equivalent.\n[920] There remains one other issue to consider which relates to Canada Post's statement, on page 264 of Chapter 11 of its written submissions, viz:\nAny wage-gap analysis under section 11 is incomplete and inaccurate without an analysis of all forms of non-wage compensation. A full analysis is not only necessary; it is a required element of Section 11, and therefore a required element of a prima facie case.\n[921] The resulting question that the Tribunal must address is: Has a reasonably reliable analysis been undertaken by the Complainant with respect to the non-wage components of compensation to meet the requirements of section 11 of the Act?\n[922] First, the Tribunal accepts, from the evidence, that the manner in which the examination of the non-wage components was handled in this case was far from what one would expect from a joint employer-employee \"pay equity\" study. It was even removed from what one might consider as normal, accepted practice. Neither the Commission nor the Alliance dealt with the matter during the Investigation Stage. It was then left to the Alliance, during the hearing process of the Complaint, to engage Dr. Lee, an expert in contract analysis and non-wage compensation valuation to undertake a detailed study. This involved, as already noted, the examination of the many collective agreements and benefit plans that existed during the life of the Complaint. These agreements and plans involved Canada Post and the two unions representing the CR complainant group and the PO comparator group.\n[923] Dr. Lee's finding, as expressed in his Report PSAC-55, challenged methodologically by Mr. Bass, was that current contract provisions for most forms of non-wage compensation were either \"precisely the same or generally equivalent\". Where differences did exist, Dr. Lee found them to be minor and, in most cases, did \"not have a wage equivalent value which would be considered significant for the purposes of pay equity\". He went on to conclude that \"there is no difference in non-wage compensation which should be incorporated into the calculation of adjustments\" which may arise for the CR complainant group.\n[924] Does Dr. Lee's work, despite Mr. Bass's criticisms which were reviewed earlier in this Section of the Decision, constitute a reasonably reliable response to the need to consider the non-wage elements under section 11 of the Act?\n[925] During the Investigation Stage of the Complaint, no costing of non-wage benefits was done by the Complainant or by the Commission despite the fact that subsection 11(7) of the Act calls for an identification of these elements as part of the definition of \"wages\".\n[926] Dr. Lee was engaged by the Complainant well into the hearing, and, as a result of the lateness of his employment, he had no ability to verify data pertaining to the benefits or to cost them. He did the best he could given the situation he faced.\n[927] Given these circumstances, the Tribunal drew on the spectrum approach used earlier to deal with the reasonable reliability of the job information used by the Professional Team in its job evaluations (paragraph [696]). The Tribunal concluded that it could not categorize Dr. Lee's Report and its results as being \"upper reasonably reliable\" or \"mid-reasonably reliable\". The Tribunal finds, however, that his methodology and its results were \"lower reasonably reliable\".\n[928] The fact that the analysis was accomplished at an awkward time, by one expert witness, and demonstrated that the wage equivalent values for the non-wage compensation components for the complainant CR's and the comparator PO's essentially balanced each other out, does not, in the Tribunal's view, mean that subsection 11(7) of the Act was not respected. Nor does it mean that the wage gap analysis was incomplete or necessarily inaccurate.\n[929] The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Alliance, through the evidence of Dr. Lee, has met the requirements of the Act in considering the non-wage compensation elements of subsection 11(7) of the Act as part of the definition of \"wages\".\n[930] The Tribunal also finds that the Alliance has fulfilled this requirement of a prima facie case under section 11 of the Act by proving, based on Dr. Lee's evidence and, on a balance of probabilities, that there were essentially no differences in non-wage compensation between the subject CR and PO employees that should be considered in determining if there were any \"differences in wages\" under subsection 11(1).\nIX. Remedy A. Background [931] The provisions of the Act dealing with the Tribunal's jurisdiction to award remedies are as follows:\nComplaint Substantiated\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(...)\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nSpecial Compensation\n53(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\nInterest\n53(4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\n[932] Clearly, the Tribunal has been bestowed broad remedial powers under section 53 of the Act to remedy the effects of discrimination when a human rights complaint has been substantiated under the Act.\n[933] As the Commission pointed out in its submissions, these remedial powers should ensure that the victims of discriminatory treatment or practice are \"made whole.\" In addressing the assessment of the damages recoverable by a victim in either tort or human rights law, the\nCommission referred to the following statement made by Mr. Justice Marceau in the Morgan case:\nIn both fields, the goal is exactly the same: make the victim whole for the damage caused by the act [sic] source of liability. Any other goal would simply lead to an unjust enrichment and a parallel unjust impoverishment.228\n[934] One can, perhaps, best interpret \"making the victim whole\" as meaning restoring the victim to the position or status he or she would have been in had the substantiated discrimination not occurred.\n[935] It is also pertinent to note, as did the Commission in its submissions, Mr. Justice Hugessen's examination of paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act in which he and his colleagues were considering an equal pay for work of equal value case:\nAs I read this provision, it is a simple and straightforward authority to order the payment to a victim of lost wages resulting from a discriminatory practice. Such an order will always be backward looking and will result from the answer to the question 'what wages was this victim deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice?' Nothing in the text justifies the view that such an award should be 'minimally afforded' or that its starting point should be restricted 'to the moment the complaint was filed'. A complaint of discrimination necessarily relates to practices which have predated the complaint itself; one can hardly complain of discrimination which has not yet occurred. Of course, the discrimination may be continuing so that the Tribunal will also order remedies for the future, but that fact should not blind us to the obvious need to remedy what has taken place in the past.229\n[936] In the same aforementioned DND case, Mr. Justice Hugessen made the following statement, supported by the very extract identified earlier in paragraph [679] from S.M. Waddam's publication:\nIn my view, it is well settled law that once it is known that a plaintiff has suffered damage, a court cannot refuse to make an award simply because the proof of the precise amount thereof is difficult or impossible. The judge must do the best he can with what he has.230\n[937] There is another important contextual factor to consider which relates to the possible impact on an award for damages of any uncertainty about the nature, extent and value of the losses involved. This matter was addressed by Mr. Justice Marceau as follows:\nIt seems to me that the proof of the existence of a real loss and its connection with the discriminatory act should not be confused with that of its extent. To establish that real damage was actually suffered creating a right to compensation, it was not required to prove that, without the discriminatory practice, the position would certainly have been obtained. Indeed, to establish actual damage, one does not require a probability. In my view, a mere possibility, provided it was a serious one, is sufficient to prove its reality. But, to establish the extent of that damage and evaluate the monetary compensation to which it could give rise, I do not see how it would be possible to simply disregard evidence that the job could have been denied in any event. The presence of such uncertainty would prevent an assessment of the damages to the same amount as if no such uncertainty existed. The amount would have had to be reduced to the extent of such uncertainty. (emphasis added)231\n[938] Two more recent cases have come to the Tribunal's attention which illustrate the principle enunciated by Mr. Justice Marceau. One is Chopra v. Department of National Health and Welfare in which the complainant sought compensation for wage loss arising from his failure to attain acting status and to qualify as an eligible candidate in a competition for a more senior position in his department.232 The complainant was awarded damages by the tribunal which were very significantly reduced on the grounds of the relatively high level of uncertainty of his being successful in the final competition. This decision is currently the subject of a judicial review application before the Federal Court.\n[939] The second case is Singh v. Statistics Canada [1998] in which the tribunal found that the complainant had been discriminated against because of his age when his name was not added to an eligibility list for particular positions at Statistics Canada.233 Damages were, however, based on providing him with a position and allowances two classification rungs below the one sought by the complainant and the CHRC, on the grounds that \"it is by no means certain that Mr. Singh's progress would have followed\" the path he claimed.234 The decision was upheld by the Federal Court.235\n[940] While the presence of uncertainty in determining the extent of damages should not, indeed must not, inhibit the Tribunal from awarding damages, that uncertainty can, nevertheless, result in a reduction, under some circumstances very appreciable, in the assessed value of the damages.\n[941] Given the classification, by the Tribunal, of the job information used in evaluating the CR positions and PO jobs, as \"lower reasonably reliable,\" (paragraph [699]) the Tribunal finds there is present a significant degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty arises from the lowest rating on the \"band of acceptance\" which pre-empts an assessment of the wage loss damages to the amount that could be expected had the job information been rated at the \"upper reasonably reliable\" level - the most desirable level for a \"pay equity\" case.\n[942] A similar further element of uncertainty arises from the classification, by the Tribunal, of the non-wage forms of compensation as also being \"lower reasonably reliable\" (paragraph [927]).\n[943] Taking into account these elements of uncertainty which affect the very crucial aspect of determining the extent of the wage gap, it is, in the Tribunal's view, more likely than not that if the job information and the non-wage benefits had been \"upper reasonably reliable,\" the resulting wage gap would have more accurately reflected reality. In other words, the greater the reliability of the job information and the non-wage benefits, the greater the accuracy of the wage gap determination. This determination is seminal to the extent of the award of damages.\n[944] Recognizing these elements of uncertainty in the state of the job information and non-wage benefits documentation, the Tribunal finds that it cannot accept the full extent of the wage gap as claimed by the Alliance and endorsed by the Commission.\nB. Remedial Components (i) Award of Lost Wages [945] On balance, the Tribunal favours the level-to-line Kervin\/Commission methodology in determining the extent of the wage gap to be closed (paragraph [844]). Both Dr. Kervin and the Commission stated however, that their wage gap calculations were only estimates. Final costing of individual adjustments for each CR employee will require review of employee records in concert with Canada Post.\n[946] As noted above, the Tribunal finds that the job information and the non-wage compensation issues have created uncertainty in the determination of the wage gap. That uncertainty, in turn, calls for a discounting of the award of lost wages.\n[947] Unlike other sections of the Act, section 11 does not present a clear distinction between proof of liability and proof of damages. Nor does it present a clear methodology to measure damages arising after a finding of discrimination. It is, therefore, necessary for the Tribunal to address the distinction between proof of liability and of damages, as well as the means of measuring the possible damages.\n[948] Following the spectrum analysis already completed for the two elements of uncertainty, the Tribunal concludes that a wage gap determination based upon \"upper reasonable reliability\" evidence should, logically, give rise to a 100% award of lost wages, a determination based upon \"mid reasonable reliability\" to a 75% award, and a determination based upon \"lower reasonable reliability\" to an award of 50% or less.\n[949] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the finally determined award of lost wages for each eligible CR employee, by whatever methodology, should be discounted by 50% in line with the lower reasonable reliability status of the relevant job information and non-wage forms of compensation.\n(ii) Back-Pay - The Compensation Period [950] The Commission has called for the awarding of lost wages back to October 16, 1981, the date of incorporation of Canada Post as a Crown Corporation. The Commission cited Mr. Justice Hugessen's decision in the DND case which recognized the ability of a tribunal to deviate from the Commission's practice of one year prior to the filing of a complaint, as follows:\nIn ordinary circumstances, the present limit set by the Commission's practice of one year prior to the filing of the complaint seems to me to strike a reasonable balance between the competing interests involved. Like any limitation period, it is, of course somewhat arbitrary and I would temper such arbitrariness by holding that it could be varied by a tribunal if the facts in any particular case indicated that a longer or shorter period was warranted.236\n[951] The Alliance also cited this case and submitted that the effective date for the calculations of lost wages should be October 16, 1981. Anything less would be, in the Alliance's view, unfair to the victims of systemic discrimination.\n[952] Canada Post submitted that the Alliance had not succeeded in establishing a prima facie case that any wage gap for which Canada Post could be liable under section 11 existed prior to the filing of the Complaint. Canada Post also pointed out that the tribunal in the Treasury Board (Phase II) case237, where the respondent admitted liability under section 11, did not award back-pay for any period prior to the filing of the complaint. The wage adjustment was ordered to run from the starting date of the JUMI Study - some 3\u00bd months after the complaint had been filed. It was Canada Post's position that the facts in this current case support no retroactive payments.\n[953] Mr. Justice Hugessen in DND indicated that the reach of paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act \"will always be backward looking\" in ordering the payment of lost wages resulting from a discriminatory practice.238\n[954] The Complaint was filed on August 24, 1983 but during 1984 and 1985, it was not actively investigated by the Commission. The Alliance and Canada Post were pre-occupied during this period with other matters, particularly the development of the proposed System One job evaluation plan. The Commission reactivated its investigation in October 1985.\n[955] The Tribunal considers that given the systemic nature of the discrimination under section 11, there should be recognition of some period of retroactivity. At the same time, the Federal Court of Appeal in Morgan affirmed that in creating a period of compensation, common sense should apply and some limits need to be placed upon liability.\n[956] Given that there was no evidence presented to underline an argument that this Complaint should be treated differently, the Tribunal concludes that adherence to the Commission's frequent practice of limiting that period to one year prior to the filing of the Complaint would be a reasonable balance under all the circumstances. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that August 24, 1982 is the appropriate date to begin the compensation period.\n[957] In terms of the period of time the backpay should cover, it is noted that Alliance counsel advised the Tribunal, in June 2003, that the Alliance and Canada Post had entered into a Letter of Understanding, as of June 6, 2002, under their then current Collective Agreement, providing for the introduction of a new Job Evaluation Plan. The new Plan superceded the original Treasury Board classification standards and created six administrative levels A1 to A6, into which former CR's were to be reclassified, as appropriate. The implementation date for the new Plan was set for August 3, 2002, with the new wage rates taking retroactive effect as of June 3, 2002.\n[958] Alliance counsel stated that the resulting range of wage rates for the CR's arising from the new Plan was, in general, quite a bit higher than the wage rates for PO INT's and PO EXT's under the CUPW agreement expiring in January 2003. What does this all mean?\n[959] What it meant to Alliance counsel, in terms of its impact on this Complaint, was expressed as follows:\n\"...it marks the outside boundary of this pay equity complaint\".239\n\"...in all likelihood, this does represent the end of the complaint, the outer limit, the outer parameter of the complaint\".240\n[960] The position of Alliance counsel is reinforced by the fact that the Letter of Understanding of June 6, 2002, was a direct result of a Memorandum of Understanding (Appendix `D') of the then current Canada Post \/ Alliance Collective Agreement, expiring October 31, 2004. The Memorandum of Understanding recorded the concurrence of Canada Post and the Alliance (and Union of Postal Communications Employees) that the proposed new Job Evaluation Plan would \"be free of gender bias and shall meet the requirements of section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act\".\n[961] Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the back-pay period will extend from August 24, 1982 to June 2, 2002, after which there should be no wage gap between the complainant CR's and the comparator PO's. Furthermore, the Tribunal concludes that with the new wage rates for the former CR's taking effect from June 3, 2002, there will be no need for a \"fold-in\" into the base wage rates per level at that date, since the successor administrative A1 to A6 levels, as of that same date, were compatible with section 11.\n(iii) Interest [962] Subsection 53(4) of the Act provides for the inclusion of an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the Tribunal considers appropriate, in any order to pay compensation under section 53. Such an order is subject to the rules made pursuant to subsection 48.9(2) of the Act which reads as follows:\nTribunal Rules of Procedure\n48.9(2) The Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal, including, but not limited to, rules governing...\n(i) awards of interest.\n[963] The Commission indicated that in the past there was debate as to whether the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal had the authority to make awards of interest as there was no provision in the Act providing for such awards. The 1998 amendments to the Act added such a provision in subsections 48.9 and 53(4).\n[964] All three parties referred to Rule 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure (dated January 8, 2000) which reads as follows:\nAwards of Interest\n9(12) Unless the Panel orders otherwise, any award of interest under s. 53(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act shall\na) be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Canada Savings Bond rate; and\nb) begin accruing from the date on which the discriminatory practice occurred.\n[965] The Commission submitted that interest consists of two elements, namely, compensation for the loss of use of money, and compensation for the decline of its value. It also noted that Rule 9(12) is an interim and not a final Rule of Procedure and permits the Tribunal to award interest otherwise than as delineated in the Rule.\n[966] The circumstances of this case with affected employees waiting over 20 years for a wage adjustment was, in the Commission's view, justification for a more generous award than Rule 9(12) would provide. The Commission called for an award of compound interest at the Courts of Justice Act rate, thereby providing fuller compensation.241\n[967] The Alliance's submission was that the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to award interest at a higher rate and also favoured compound interest, calculated semi-annually, at the rate established by the Courts of Justice Act.\n[968] Both the Alliance and the Commission considered that their respective positions on the matter of compound interest were supported by Waddams, supra, which concluded that compound interest, as a principle, could be warranted under certain conditions.\n[969] Canada Post's position was that it would be inappropriate to award compound interest without demonstrating, as indicated in Morgan, a special need or circumstance to compensate for the actual loss sustained. In the opinion of Canada Post, neither the Commission nor the Alliance had presented any evidence to support an exceptional compound interest award or a rate of interest higher than the Canada Savings Bond rate.\n[970] Despite the protracted period of the current case and the resulting delays in reaching a conclusion for the complainant employees, the Tribunal finds that no special needs or circumstances were demonstrated in the evidence before it which would justify an award of compound interest.\n[971] The Tribunal therefore, concludes that simple interest should be payable on the finally determined award of lost wages, which should in turn be discounted by 50%. The simple interest should be at the Canada Savings Bond rate, beginning from the commencement date of the retroactive period, August 24, 1982. Calculations should be annual, using the Canada Savings Bond rate in effect on September 1st of each year concerned.\n(iv) Post- Judgement Interest [972] With the likelihood that there will be delays between the date of the Tribunal's final decision and the date of payment of awards to entitled employees, the Commission and the Alliance submitted that post-judgement interest should be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act.\n[973] The Tribunal agrees, subject to the proviso that any such post-judgement interest shall be calculated from the date of its Order, on the finally determined award of lost wages discounted by 50%.\n(v) Special Compensation [974] The Alliance submitted that the evidence supported a finding by the Tribunal that Canada Post wilfully engaged in a discriminatory practice and that special compensation should be ordered under subsection 53(3) of the Act.\n[975] The Alliance argued that, through no fault of their own, the affected employees have been waiting some 20 years for their Complaint to be resolved. The Alliance also argued that its earlier efforts to negotiate a solution at the bargaining table were rebuffed by the employer.\n[976] It was, as well, the Alliance's view that Canada Post had consciously avoided satisfying itself as to whether the work of the female-dominated CR group was of equal value to that of the male-dominated PO group. Instead, Canada Post had chosen solely to advance criticisms and arguments of a technical and legal nature designed to avoid its obligations under section 11 of the Act.\n[977] A further argument presented by the Alliance was the profound impact the Respondent's violation of section 11 has had on the mostly low wage earners of the CR group. Being deprived of the income comprising the wage gap can reasonably be seen, in particular cases, to have led to \"a host of lost opportunities\" which should be reflected in the Tribunal's remedial order.\n[978] Finally, the Alliance submitted that the disappointment and frustration associated with the length of time it has taken to obtain redress should be compensated in the form of damages for hurt feelings.\n[979] While recognizing that no amount of monetary compensation can properly eradicate the impact of so many years of underpayment, the Alliance submitted that employees in the CR group should each receive compensation pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the Act, to be determined at the Tribunal's discretion. The Alliance proposed that the award be prorated based on the number of full years worked by each eligible employee.\n[980] The Alliance further submitted that simple interest calculated pursuant to the Ontario Courts of Justice Act should be paid on the special compensation awards.\n[981] The Commission noted that pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) and subsection 53(3), the Tribunal is empowered to award compensation for pain and suffering and special compensation. The Commission indicated however, that in the circumstances of this case, it had taken no position on the Alliance's claim.\n[982] Canada Post submitted that it was not appropriate to award special compensation in this case and argued that the Alliance did not direct any evidence to the Tribunal of the nature required to support such a request.\n[983] Canada Post also submitted that the law respecting special damages is clear and was set out well by the tribunal in the Treasury Board (Phase II) case, as follows:\nWe are of the view that an entitlement under s. 53(3)(b) of the Act requires an evidentiary basis outlining the effects of the discriminatory practice on the individuals concerned. An award for hurt feelings is personal and is usually awarded in the context of direct discrimination. During the course of a hearing a tribunal will assess entitlement after hearing from individuals about the effects of the discrimination upon him or her. (see R. v. Cranston (1997), T.D. 1\/97 (C.H.R.T.)). In this manner the Tribunal is able to observe the complainant's demeanour while testifying and come to some conclusion whether, in the circumstances, an award for hurt feelings is called for. In our view the impact of delays giving rise to disappointments, frustrations, maybe even sadness or anger, although legitimate reactions, do not measure up, in our opinion, to the degree and extent of hurt feelings and loss of self-respect that s. 53(3)(b) is directed towards remedying.\nThe discriminatory practice in this case has its genesis in societal attitudes and history, shared by both males and females. Attitudes about female work are undergoing change with increased awareness, education and legislation. The problem here is systemic and it has occurred in the Employer's pay system. To grant the Commission's and the Alliance's request would amount to an award for hurt feelings, en masse, which is not, in our view, what is contemplated by s. 53(3)(b) of the Act.\nWe do not doubt some Complainants have experienced a sense of loss, which in some cases may be felt more strongly by some than others. We also appreciate the impracticality of individuals in this case testifying before the Tribunal as to the effects of the discriminatory practice upon them. However, these factors cannot compel us to make an award, en masse, under s. 53(3)(b).242\n[984] The Tribunal notes that, in the aforementioned excerpt from the Treasury Board (Phase II) case, the tribunal was addressing paragraph 53(3)(b) from the pre-1998 amended version of the Act which read as follows:\n53(3) In addition to any order that the Tribunal may make pursuant to subsection (2), if the Tribunal finds that\n(a) a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly, or\n(b) the victim of the discriminatory practice has suffered in respect of feelings or self-respect as a result of the practice,\nthe Tribunal may order the person to pay such compensation to the victim, not exceeding five thousand dollars, as the Tribunal may determine.\n[985] The tribunal in the Treasury Board case was, therefore, dealing with the Commission's argument that, as a result of the discriminatory practice, the victims suffered from hurt feelings and a loss of self-respect (former paragraph 53(3)(b)). That tribunal was not addressing in this context whether a person had been engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly (former paragraph 53(3)(a)).\n[986] On the other hand, in the current case, the Alliance has submitted that Canada Post wilfully engaged in a discriminatory practice under subsection 53(3) of the current Act. It has made no direct mention of \"pain and suffering\" under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the current Act.\n[987] Canada Post's use of the Treasury Board (Phase II) case decision to support its dismissal of the Alliance's claim was therefore, in the Tribunal's view, somewhat misdirected as the Treasury Board decision focused squarely on the suffering of victims in respect of \"feelings or self-respect\" and not on a person engaged in a discriminatory practice \"wilfully or recklessly\".\n[988] In fairness to Canada Post, however, the Alliance does appear to have considered aspects of both paragraph 53(2)(e) and subsection 53(3), although it limited its specific written request to subsection 53(3).243 For example, while alleging wilful engagement of Canada Post in a discriminatory practice, it also submitted that its victims experienced considerable disappointment and frustration and may have suffered in respect of \"hurt feelings\", which seems to come close to the pain and suffering element of paragraph 53(2)(e).\n[989] Given the fact that the Alliance has limited its submission to the provisions of subsection 53(3), the Tribunal has focused on, but has not confined its decision to, that remedial dimension of section 53 of the Act. While the Alliance has argued that Canada Post contributed to the prolonged nature of the Complaint, and protracted the process through its technical and legal criticisms and arguments, the Tribunal does not find that sufficient detailed evidence was furnished to lead the Tribunal to conclude that Canada Post had been engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[990] The subject discriminatory practice is, after all, systemic discrimination which, as a concept, has most often been found to be unintentional. As well, the Act is a statute that seeks remedial corrective action rather than one that seeks to cast blame and punishment.\n[991] Based on the evidence presented, the Tribunal does not find that Canada Post has, more likely than not, been engaged in practicing systemic discrimination, wilfully or recklessly. Nor does the Tribunal find that sufficient evidence was provided to document the extent to which victims of the systemic discrimination, either individually, or corporately, may have experienced pain and suffering, difficult as this may be to demonstrate when dealing with a large body of employees.\n[992] Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that no award is justified under subsection 53(3) or paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act.\n(vi) Legal Costs [993] The legal costs, including fees and disbursements associated with the adjudication of the Complaint involving over 400 days of hearings, \"are enormous,\" argued the Alliance. To ensure full compensation for the victims, the Alliance felt it essential that the legal costs be taken into account. This has, in the Alliance's submission, occurred in the past where complainant counsel have contributed an important dimension to the presentation of the complainant's case, as the Alliance has done in this case.\n[994] The Alliance submitted that it is settled law that paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act provides the Tribunal with the authority to award legal costs as well as compensation for other expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. Alliance counsel referred to a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Grover v. Canada (National Research Council), [1992] C.H.R.D. No. 12 (QL). In that case, the tribunal ordered the respondent to pay the complainant's legal costs pursuant to the assessment of the costs under the Federal Court scale.\n[995] The Alliance also referred to a decision of the Federal Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Thwaites, [1994] F.C.J. No. 364 (T.D.) and to a tribunal decision in Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 43 (QL). Both decisions were in the Alliance's submission, supportive of the inclusion of reasonable legal costs in the compensation award to a successful complainant.\n[996] Therefore, the Alliance has called for an order of the Tribunal to award its legal costs. It proposes that such costs be calculated on a substantial indemnity basis in accordance with the Tariff prescribed under the Ontario Courts of Justice Act and the Rules of Civil Procedure.\n[997] The Commission submitted that while there has, in the past, been some inconsistency in the awarding of legal costs, recent jurisprudence supports the authority of tribunals to do so. In particular, the Commission cited Nkwazi and Premakumar v. Air Canada, drawing on the following excerpt from the latter tribunal's decision:\nI am of the view that the remedial objects of the Canadian Human Rights Act are best attained by ensuring that successful complainants are able to recover their reasonable legal expenses associated with the prosecution of human rights complaints.244\n[998] Given the 20-year life of the Complaint and the \"immense\" legal fees and expenses related to the complex litigation involving numerous expert and lay witnesses, the Commission supported a full award of legal costs in favour of the Complainant group. The Commission acknowledged the \"very active role\" played by the Alliance in the adjudication, \"including bearing considerable costs for the gender neutral job evaluation process engaged in by Dr. Wolf and his colleagues\".245\n[999] The Commission concluded that these factors militate in favour of an award of full legal costs to the Alliance.\n[1000] Canada Post submitted that the current case was not an appropriate one for an award of legal costs. While the proceedings have been protracted and complex, Canada Post cited the tribunal's decision in Treasury Board (Phase II) case, where an award of legal costs was deemed to be inappropriate.\n[1001] Ambiguously, Canada Post in its concluding submission, requested the following ruling by the Tribunal:\nBased upon a broad and liberal interpretation of section 53(1) of the Act, that Canada Post Corporation be reimbursed for its reasonable legal costs in this proceeding as against the CHRC and\/or the PSAC.246\n[1002] The Tribunal observes that this has been not only a very protracted and complex case but also a rather tortuous one. Allegations have been made about Canada Post's possible role in this tortuosity, but it can also be alleged that the Commission was not entirely responsibility-free -- that it, too, may have contributed to that tortuosity, by the way it managed the Investigation Stage of the Complaint. It can also be alleged that even the Alliance made its own contribution to that tortuosity by not ensuring, during the formative stage of the Complaint, that the non-wage elements of compensation under subsection 11(7) of the Act were included in the wage calculations.\n[1003] However, as indicated earlier in this Decision, laying blame is not an objective of the Act, nor is it a course which the Tribunal has pursued. Having moved into the adjudicative tribunal arena, each party opted to act within its respective rights and decided and honed its strategies with respect to the Complaint. Each party engaged its own legal counsel and directed them accordingly.\n[1004] Given the unintentional nature of the alleged systemic discrimination in this case, and after carefully considering all the arguments and evidence made available, the Tribunal finds that each party should assume responsibility for its own legal costs, including related disbursements.\n(vii) Retention of Jurisdiction [1005] Both the Alliance and the Commission have requested that the Tribunal retain jurisdiction to deal with issues that they expect may arise in the implementation of the Tribunal's decision, on an \"as-needed\" basis.\n[1006] In the interest of assisting all parties, as may be appropriate, the Tribunal agrees with this request.\nX. JOINT UNION-EMPLOYER LIABILITY FOR WAGE DISCRIMINATION A. Canada Post's Submission [1007] Canada Post submitted that, were the Tribunal to find that the Complaint has been substantiated, the Alliance, as the union representing the Complainant group, and Canada Post, as the employer, should be held jointly liable for the discriminatory practice.\n[1008] The basis for this submission by Canada Post was their argument that as a principle, a union and an employer share liability for any clauses, including those that are discriminatory, which are negotiated in a collective agreement.\n[1009] In support of this position, Canada Post relied on the decisions in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 790, and Canada Safeway Ltd. v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission), [1997] S.J. No. 502 (Sask. C.A.).\nB. The Alliance's Position [1010] The Alliance submitted that the wording of subsection 11(1) of the Act clearly precludes the imposition of liability on anyone other than an employer.\n[1011] Further, the Alliance submitted that the decision in Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada is binding authority concerning the interpretation of subsection 11(1).247\n[1012] The Alliance urged the Tribunal to find that the cases cited by Canada Post could be distinguished.\nC. The Commission's Position [1013] The Commission's submissions underlined those of the Alliance.\nD. Tribunal's Analysis [1014] The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Bell Canada, cited by the Alliance as authority for their submissions concerning the interpretation of subsection 11(1) of the Act, contains strong statements to the effect that section 11 of the Act makes the employer alone liable for differences in wages with respect to work of equal value. For example, at paragraph 56, the Court noted as follows:\nFor reasons of its own Parliament has chosen, in section 11, to make the employer alone liable for differences in wages with respect to work of equal value. It would fly in the face of the clear wording of the Act and the obvious intent of Parliament to find the unions equally liable either implicitly under section 11 or indirectly through sections such as section 10 for having participated in the establishment of different wages with respect to work of equal value. It may at first blush appear to be self serving and unethical for a union to use the mechanism of a complaint under section 11 to force for all practical purposes the revision of a collective agreement it has freshly negotiated, but absent bad faith -- the Motions Judge did not make a specific finding of bad faith in the instant case... -- it is not legally wrong. The Court applies the Act as it is, not as it might have been.248\n[1015] This decision was rendered by one of the Tribunal's supervisory courts. The decision included the above-mentioned discussion of the very legislative provision that is in issue in the present Complaint. Is the Tribunal bound, therefore, to follow this decision?\n[1016] The Court prefaced its remarks in that same Bell Canada case with the stipulation that it was not providing a definitive interpretation of section 11 of the Act, as follows:\nThe Motions Judge erred in totally ignoring sections 43, 44, and 49 of the Act and in his premise that '[w]hat is principally at issue in this case is the correct interpretation of s. 11' (Paragraph (8) of his reasons [at page 85]) That was simply not the issue at this stage. The decision attacked is the decision to request the appointment of a Human Rights Tribunal. It will be the duty of the Tribunal to determine whether the complaints are well founded or not and the Tribunal will in no way be bound by the interpretation given to section 11 by the investigator and presumably adopted by the Commission. Those who expected this Court to resolve issues with respect to the interpretation and application of section 11 without the benefit of the decision of a tribunal on this issue in the instant case will be disappointed; whatever was said by the Motions Judge should be considered as obiter and I make no observations upon any of it.249\n[1017] As can be seen from the comments of the Federal Court of Appeal, the decision in Bell Canada, upon which the Alliance and the Commission relied in their submissions was fundamentally concerned with the legality of the Commission's decision, under section 49 of the Act, to request the appointment of a Human Rights Tribunal.\n[1018] Accordingly, this Tribunal has concluded that the question of joint union-employer liability under section 11 of the Act remains an open question for its decision.\n[1019] Subsection 11(1) of the Act clearly indicates on whose shoulders liability must rest. It states as follows:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages... (emphasis added)\n[1020] This wording can be contrasted to that of other provisions of the Act, such as section 10 which explicitly addresses employee organizations as well as employers, and section 7 which contains no qualifying language.\n[1021] Based on a clear and straightforward reading of subsection 11(1), the argument that a union may incur liability under this section must be rejected. Canada Post's reference to the Renaud and Safeway cases has not been helpful in this instance, as they both dealt with legislative provisions that addressed union liability, and are distinguishable on that basis. In this case, there is no such inclusion. In fact, the section of the Act is very clear in its notation that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages. There is no mention of other organizations, nor is there a lack of clarity in the wording.\n[1022] Therefore, the Tribunal cannot accept the submission of Canada Post on this issue of \"joint liability\".\nXI. ORDERS [1023] Based on all of its foregoing findings and conclusions, including a breach of section 11 of the Act, the Tribunal Orders that:\nThe Respondent shall pay to each of its eligible Clerical and Regulatory employees an award for lost wages by closing the wage gap between employees of the Complainant and Comparator groups represented in this Complaint. The wage gap between the Complainant group and the Comparator group shall be determined and calculated by a level-to-line technique, preferably following the Kervin\/Commission Wage Adjustment Model. The Respondent shall provide access to the individual employee records, as required, to enable final wage gap calculations to be determined. The finally determined award of lost wages (\"pay for all purposes\") for each eligible CR employee, by whatever methodology, shall be discounted by 50%. The back-pay compensation period shall extend from August 24, 1982 to June 2, 2002. Simple interest shall be calculated annually on the amount of the 50% discounted award of lost wages, and paid to each eligible CR employee for each year, or fraction thereof, of the back-pay compensation period. The simple interest shall be determined using the Canada Savings Bond rate in effect on September 1st of each year concerned. Between the date of this Decision and the date of the ultimate payment of the 50% back-pay award of lost wages, post-judgement simple interest shall be paid to each eligible CR employee at the applicable post-judgement rate prescribed by the Courts of Justice Act of Ontario or comparable provincial legislation. The Respondent shall be responsible for making remittances, as necessary, that may arise as a result of any of these Orders, with respect to statutory-based non-wage forms of compensation. The Complainant's claim for special compensation pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) or subsection 53(3) of the Act is hereby dismissed. The claims for legal costs are hereby dismissed. The Respondent's submission that both it and the Alliance should be jointly liable for any substantiated wage discrimination is hereby dismissed. The Tribunal shall retain jurisdiction to deal with issues that may arise in the implementation of its Decision, on an \"as needed\" basis.\nSigned by\nElizabeth Leighton\nSigned by\nGerald T.

SHILLINGTON'S DOCUMENTS PREPARED IN CANADA POST AND GNWT\nPANEL: J. Grant Sinclair Pierre Deschamps\n2005 CHRT 4 2005\/01\/27\nINTRODUCTION [1] The Complainant, CEP, proposes to call Dr. Richard Shillington and qualify him as an expert in applied statistics to give evidence in this hearing. The Respondent, Bell Canada, seeks production of certain reports prepared by Dr. Shillington for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which are listed, on pp. 14 and 15 of his Curriculum Vitae, filed as exhibit CEP-34. Bell says that it wants to use these documents for the purpose of its cross-examination of Dr. Shillington on his qualifications as an expert.\n[2] On consent of the parties, the Tribunal was given copies of these reports to review on a confidential basis. For the purpose of this ruling, they are referred to as GNWT, CPC-1 and CPC-2.\nGNWT [3] This consists of three reports, two dated March 28, 2001 and one dated March 19, 2001. The Commission claims settlement privilege with respect to GNWT. It argues that settlement privilege attaches because the reports were prepared for Ian Fine, Commission counsel, for the purpose of and during the course of settlement negotiations in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Government of the Northwest Territories. In his affidavit filed on this motion, Mr. Fine states that the Commission relied on these reports in developing its position during the settlement negotiations. He also states that these confidential reports have never been disclosed or used by the Commission other than in the course of settlement discussions.\nNO PRIVILEGE FOR THE COMMISSION [4] The Commission asserts litigation privilege for CPC-1 and CPC-2. CPC-1 contains five reports prepared in 1996-97 by Dr. Shillington. CPC-2 is a six page report prepared by Dr. Shillington dated May 28, 1999. He testified that they were both provided at the request of Fiona Keith, Commission counsel in Canada Post.\n[5] Bell's first argument is that the Commission has no claim in law to litigation or settlement privilege. For this argument, Bell relies on the Tribunal's decision in Dhanjal v. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. (CHRT), D\/367, D\/422-3.\n[6] Dhanjal does not involve any issue relating to privilege. In the Addendum to its decision, the Tribunal commented on the conduct of Commission counsel, which the Tribunal characterized as excessively adversarial. It was the Tribunal's view that the role of Commission counsel is akin to the role of Crown counsel in a criminal proceeding as described by Sopinka J. in R v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326. This role is that of the Minister of Justice representing the public interest. (p. 341)\n[7] Stinchcombe established that there is a general obligation on the Crown to disclose to the defense the fruits of its investigation. The rationale being that such information is in the public domain and is not to be used for the sole purpose of obtaining a conviction, but to ensure that justice is done. (p. 333)\n[8] Under s. 51 of the CHRA, Commission counsel has the role of representing the public interest. By analogy, Bell argues that the Commission has the same obligation as the Crown, namely, to disclose all relevant information. Ergo, it cannot assert any privilege.\n[9] In our view, Bell's reliance on Stinchcombe involves a misapplication of the Stinchcombe facts to this case and an incomplete reading of Stinchcombe. Stinchcombe deals with a criminal proceeding, striking a balance between the Crown and the defense as mandated by s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and what flows from that.\n[10] Another distinction between a criminal proceeding and a Tribunal proceeding is found in the reasons of Sopinka J. where he points out that there is no duty on the defense to disclose anything to the prosecution. (p. 333) Bell has never taken the position that, as respondent in the hearing before this Tribunal, it has no obligation of disclosure.\n[11] More to the point, there is nothing in Stinchcombe that says that a claim of privilege is never available to the Crown. The reasons of Sopinka J. are to the contrary. He makes it very clear that the Crown has a general duty to disclose unless non-disclosure can be justified on the basis of the law of privilege. (p. 340)\nNO LITIGATION PRIVILEGE FOR CPC-1 OR CPC-2 [12] Bell next argues that even if privilege is available, the Commission has waived litigation privilege for CPC-1 and CPC-2. Bell relies on these facts. Public Service Alliance Commission's counsel in Canada Post asked Dr. Shillington to prepare an analysis for him. According to the Canada Post transcripts provided to this Tribunal, Dr. Shillington was a person who PSAC had been consulting with. He was helping PSAC with their understanding of the report and with the cross-examination of Dr. Killingsworth, an expert statistician who was called by Canada Post.\n[13] To do the analysis, Dr. Shillington needed certain data, which he asked for and received from Dr. Killingsworth. He then prepared the analysis which consisted, according to the transcripts, of five graphs and an Excel spreadsheet. In this ruling we referred to these five graphs and Excel spreadsheet as the June 1999 work.\n[14] In the course of his cross-examination, PSAC counsel asked Dr. Killingsworth if he agreed that the graphs and the spreadsheet were accurate and looked reasonable to him. Dr. Killingsworth replied that he was not in a position to answer this question, so PSAC counsel asked him to try and replicate Dr. Shillington's analysis. Dr. Killingsworth testified that he was able to produce very similar but not identical graphs, using, he said, the same data that he had provided to Dr. Shillington.\n[15] The graphs and spreadsheet prepared by Dr. Shillington were not entered into evidence. Canada Post counsel objected to them being so entered. The graphs prepared by Dr. Killingsworth were entered as PSAC exhibits 161, 162, 163, 164, etc.\n[16] Bell asserts that a claim of litigation privilege for Dr. Shillington's work for the Commission in Canada Post is unsupportable. In its submissions, Bell argues that it is a matter of public record that all or part of his work for the Commission was filed as PSAC exhibits 161, 162, and 163 by PSAC counsel when cross-examining Dr. Killingsworth. The Commission, says Bell, must therefore have revealed Dr. Shillington's work to another party, PSAC.\n[17] Bell next argues that, when considering the question of privilege, all of Dr. Shillington's work done for the Commission in Canada Post relating to the generic issues of pay equity must be dealt with as a package. That is, there is a nexus between the June 1999 work and CPC-1 and CPC-2 that is established by reference to the subject matter, the preparer and the nature of the issues.\n[18] Bell's concluding argument is that, having waived privilege over Dr. Shillington's June 1999 work, the Commission must also be taken to have waived privilege over all of his work done for the Commission in Canada Post relating to pay equity.\n[19] We do not accept these arguments. First of all, the Canada Post transcripts show that Dr. Shillington's graphs and spreadsheet was not work done for the Commission, but was prepared at the request of PSAC counsel.\n[20] Secondly, Bell has misstated the facts. It is not the case that all or part of Dr. Shillington's work for the Commission was filed as PSAC exhibits 161, 162, 163,etc. The facts are that none of his work has been so entered. PSAC exhibits 161, 162, 163, etc. were prepared by Dr. Killingsworth.\n[21] Thirdly, it is clear that PSAC counsel did not intend nor did he make any claim to shield Dr. Shillington's work from scrutiny by the other side when he presented it to Dr. Killingsworth for the purpose of cross-examination.\n[22] Finally, even assuming that Dr. Shillington's work for PSAC was prepared for the Commission and shared with PSAC counsel and was made public, we do not agree that there is a sufficient nexus between this work and CPC-1 and CPC-2. Bell, admittedly, has no authorities to support its argument that all of Dr. Shillington's work must be considered as a package. Bell's argument cannot rest on a mere assertion without more.\nNO SETTLEMENT PRIVILEGE - GNWT [23] As for GNWT, Bell challenges the Commission's assertion of settlement privilege. Bell says the settlement is a public document; it has been disseminated widely to the public and in particular, to current and former employees by way of an information campaign; and, there are documents attached to the settlement agreement that deal with technical and statistical issues, including methodology and foundation.\n[24] The policy behind settlement privilege is that parties should be encouraged to resolve their disputes without a trial. It follows then that the public interest, in encouraging the settlement of disputes, requires that documents or communications created for the purpose of settlement negotiations be privileged. (See Pirie v. Wyld,[1886] O.J. 188; Sopinka et al, Law of Evidence in Canada 2nd ed. 1999, Para. 14. 201; 14. 213)\n[25] It is also well established law that settlement privilege applies to communications made with the express or implied intention that they would not be disclosed and does not end if settlement negotiations fail or if settlement is concluded. And the privilege extends to subsequent proceedings unrelated to the previous dispute. (See Sopinka et al, Para 14.216 and 14.224; Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, [1992] B.C.J. No. 1947; 71 B.C.L.R. (2nd) 276 (B.C.C.A.))\n[26] The evidence of Ian Fine is that Dr. Shillington's reports were prepared to assist during the settlement negotiations. It was never intended that they be made public nor were they used or disclosed other than for settlement purposes.\n[27] Does the fact that the settlement reached by the parties is a matter of public record mean that all documents used in negotiations leading to the settlement lose their confidentiality? This is Bell's position and in support, Bell referred to two cases, Hill v. Gordon-Daly Grenadier Securities, (2001) 56 O.R. (3rd) 388; and Gay v. UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America, [2003] N.S.J. No. 442.\n[28] In our opinion, neither case is helpful to Bell's argument. Hill involved a prosecution under the Ontario Securities Act for breach of trust. In furtherance of a settlement agreement between the Ontario Securities Commission and the defendants, the defendants made certain admissions in the settlement agreement. On the basis of these admissions, the OSC found that the defendants failed to deal fairly and honestly with certain of their clients.\n[29] These clients brought a class action against the defendants and, to support this action, wished to rely on the admissions of the defendants contained in the settlement agreement. The defendants claimed privilege over all the settlement documents. The Ontario Divisional Court held that privilege did not apply in these circumstances.\n[30] The Court reasoned that the OSC guidelines provided that any settlement agreement would be a matter of public record. The defendant entered into the settlement agreement fully knowing that whatever they admitted would be made public. They must be taken to have waived any claim to privacy or privilege.\n[31] This case is clearly distinguishable from the GNWT facts. The settlement in GNWT was not pursuant to a statutory scheme. It cannot be concluded, as it was in Hill, that any expectation of privacy or privilege was lost when the settlement itself, not the negotiations leading into settlement, were made public.\n[32] In Gay, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant UNUM Life Insurance Company claiming accident insurance benefits. This action was subsequent to an action that she had brought against certain doctors and a hospital for malpractice. The malpractice action was settled by mediation. The mediation contract had a confidentiality clause that all communications between the parties were privileged and without prejudice.\n[33] For the mediation, the defendant doctors had disclosed to the plaintiff reports by their experts relating to the question of their professional liability. The defendant insurance company requested production of the expert reports. The Court ordered production reasoning that once the expert reports were disclosed to the plaintiff, the confidentiality was lost whether or not designated without prejudice.\n[34] In our view, the facts in GNWT are so distinguishable from Gay as to make the conclusion in Gay untransferable.\n[35] For the above reasons, Bell's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by J.

CONCLUSION\n[1] The Complainant alleges that he was discriminated against on the basis of his colour during his field training as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and that this discrimination was a factor in the subsequent termination of his employment, in breach of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Complainant also claims that he was harassed by the RCMP on the basis of his colour during this training, in violation of s. 14 of the Act.\n[2] The Complainant and the Respondent were represented by legal counsel at the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint. Counsel for the Canadian Human Rights Commission read into the record an opening statement on the first day of the hearing and thereafter did not attend nor participate in the hearing process. The hearing itself lasted 51 days and was conducted in Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa. Thirty-nine witnesses testified.\n[3] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that the Complainant's colour was not a factor in his treatment while employed with the RCMP, or in his subsequent dismissal. He found his training very stressful. It was not an enjoyable period in his life. While the employer may have been very demanding of him during his training, I am not persuaded that discrimination based on his colour was a factor in this treatment. I have also concluded that he was not harassed on the basis of his colour.\nI. FACTS A. Entry into the RCMP [4] The Complainant is a black man from Montreal. In 1994, he enrolled in a special program administered by the RCMP to train Haitians and Canadians in police technology at the RCMP Training Academy in Regina (commonly referred to as Depot). Haiti was in a transitional political period at the time and the program was established to help the country equip itself with a corps of newly trained police officers. Graduates from the program planned on joining the Haitian force. The Complainant successfully completed the program but for reasons related to his dual Canadian\/Haitian citizenship, he was unable to accompany the other recruits to Haiti. He returned home to Montreal from Regina to complete his college-level studies. Having by now developed a profound interest in police work, he applied with earnest to enter the RCMP's recruit training program at Depot shortly after obtaining his college diploma. He passed the numerous entrance exams administered by the RCMP and was accepted into the program in April 1996.\n[5] The Complainant opted to begin his instruction as soon as possible, which left him with no choice but to enter the English module. The French training was scheduled to commence several months later. The Complainant's first language is French but he had some knowledge of English at the time. The Complainant worked with bilingual text books while at Depot and with time, his knowledge of the language improved. The training lasted six months and he graduated in October 1996.\nB. Field Training - Months 1 & 2 [6] Upon completion of his training at Depot, the Complainant was assigned as a general duty officer to the RCMP detachment in Burnaby, British Columbia, to undergo his field training. This stage in a recruit's professional development is administered under the Field Coaching Program, also known as Recruit Field Training or RFT. It runs for six months. The recruit is a member of the RCMP during this period but the individual faces dismissal if he or she fails to pass the Field Coaching Program. During the RFT, a regular member of the RCMP is assigned to the recruit as his or her coach\/trainer. The coach rides patrols with the recruit for most of this period and assesses the new member's performance along the way. Assessment reports are prepared at two month intervals, and by the time the last report is drafted at the six-month point, the recruit must satisfy all of the required criteria in order to pass his RFT.\n[7] Burnaby is, of course, a large municipality situated within the greater Vancouver area. An agreement exists between the Government of Canada and the City of Burnaby to have the RCMP provide it with policing services. Burnaby's RCMP detachment is the country's second largest. The Complainant had never visited Burnaby before and knew little about the city. He arrived there on about November 15, 1996, two weeks after graduating from Depot, and was met at the airport by his assigned trainer, Constable (Cst.) John Haney.\n[8] The Complainant's first contact with his coach was amiable. Cst. Haney invited the Complainant to stay at his home until the recruit could find his own accommodations. The Complainant began his first shift the day after his arrival. Cst. Haney introduced him to other RCMP employees. He set about helping the trainee find an apartment and a convenient bank branch at which to open an account. Despite this fairly friendly start to their working relationship, the Complainant alleges that within days, he was subjected to discriminatory conduct on the part of Cst. Haney.\n[9] The Complainant wanted to purchase a used car as soon as he arrived in Burnaby and had been perusing the classified ads in the newspaper. Many of the ads contained the term OBO, which is an abbreviation for the phrase or best offer in reference to the price being sought. The Complainant was unaware of this acronym, particularly since English was his second language. He mistakenly believed that it was the name of someone in the city who had many vehicles to sell. While riding in the patrol car with Cst. Haney, the Complainant mentioned that he intended to call the person named OBO about purchasing one of his cars. Cst. Haney began to laugh at the Complainant's mistake. The Complainant did not as yet understand why. Later on, they pulled up to a fast food restaurant to have breakfast with several other RCMP officers from the detachment. Cst. Haney told the others about the Complainant's comment and everyone began to laugh. It was at this point that the Complainant learned the meaning of the abbreviation OBO and the reason for the others' laughing.\n[10] From that day forward, Cst. Haney and other RCMP members began calling the Complainant by the nickname OBO. The Complainant acknowledges that he tolerated the term for three or four days and that in fact, he was even grinning along with the others as the story about the classified ads was recounted. However, the usage of the name continued to occur months later, and people he barely knew would call him by this name. The Complainant testified that he felt like a buffoon when addressed this way. He alleges, moreover, that the name has racial connotations. Or best offer, he contends, is a term that was used during slave auctions in pre-civil war America, and this particularly offended him.\n[11] Cst. Haney recalls the discussion in the patrol car about the classified ads, adding that both he and the Complainant found humour in the latter's mistake. But he insists that there was no racial connotation in his reaction. He merely used the term OBO thereafter as a playful nickname, a sign of affiliation with the rest of the team. According to Cst. Haney, many RCMP officers at the detachment were referred to by nicknames, including himself. This was typical of the camaraderie that existed between them, not unlike the relationship that develops amongst players on sports teams. He adamantly denies the Complainant's ever having indicated expressly or implicitly that he was offended or that the usage of the name was unwelcome. The Complainant either laughed along when addressed that way or did not react at all. Cst. Haney produced a home videotape of a party at his home, which was recorded by Cst. Haney's spouse on November 30, 1996, two weeks after the start of the Complainant's RFT. About a dozen guests can be seen on the tape, including the Complainant. At one point, Cst. Haney's spouse greets the Complainant from behind the camera by saying Hey, OBO, and he can be seen smiling and responding to her greeting with a pleasant demeanour.\n[12] The Complainant alleges that another incident of discriminatory conduct on the part of Cst. Haney occurred during the early stages of his RFT. Prior to a briefing session at the detachment, Cst. Haney observed the Complainant greet Cst. Ader Albert, who is also a black individual of Haitian origin. The Complainant claims that Cst. Haney made some gesture with his hands and remarked, Is that how you black men shake hands? The Complainant stated at the hearing that he felt ridiculed by the comment. Cst. Albert testified that he had some recollection of it but that he did not take any offence. He does not recall the Complainant demonstrating any outward objection. Cst. Albert interprets Cst. Haney's statement as his just trying to be funny. Cst. Haney has no recollection of the incident at all.\n[13] Over the course of the first two months of training, the Complainant alleges that Cst. Haney started to become excessively critical of his performance and their relationship began to deteriorate. The coach found fault in much of the Complainant's conduct. Speediness in getting to the scene of a call became a point of contention. Cst. Haney disapproved of the time it took for the Complainant to drive to a location. Occasionally, he got lost. The Complainant points out that he had just arrived in Burnaby and had not as yet become familiar with its geography. For this reason, he opted to rent an apartment within Burnaby, just so that he could remain within the city even when off-duty and get to know it better. The Complainant claims that Cst. Haney was impatient in this regard and that he began to use his watch to measure the recruit's response time in getting to the scene of a call. Cst. Haney would become so enraged with the Complainant's performance that he sometimes shouted at him and banged his hands against the car. On one occasion, the Complainant retorted to Cst. Haney that they were both adults and shouting was not called for.\n[14] The Complainant says the constant timing by Cst. Haney placed an inordinate degree of pressure on him to perform, which occasionally caused him to make errors. He felt harassed by this procedure. His fellow recruits were not subjected to this type of performance measurement and indeed, virtually none of the members of the RCMP who testified in this case recalled ever having had their driving timed in this manner during their field training, though several acknowledged being told during their RFT that they were taking too long to get to a scene or to execute their other duties.\n[15] Cst. Haney agrees that the Complainant expressed displeasure at the stress he was feeling from having his driving skills timed, but the coach maintains that he developed this tool as a mechanism to correct a deficiency in the Complainant's performance. It is important for a police officer to be able to respond quickly and safely to a call. Initially, the Complainant's response times were poor as was his navigation of the city's streets. The time tool proved effective, notwithstanding the Complainant's protests, and within about a month, his response times improved to an acceptable level. Cst. Haney concedes that none of the other recruits being trained by other coaches around the same time as the Complainant were similarly timed. He contends nonetheless that the timing tool he had developed for the Complainant was useful and creative and could prove helpful with other trainees as well. He does not recall any specific instance of having raised his voice or banging his hands over this issue, as alleged by the Complainant. Cst. Haney does not deny that his constructive criticism of the Complainant could have been construed as yelling by the Complainant.\n[16] Cst. Haney did not just time how long it took the Complainant to respond to a call. He kept track of how long it took his trainee to prepare police reports. Cst. Haney claimed that the Complainant was spending too much time on reports and that their quality was poor, both in terms of substantive content and form (language and spelling). He began timing him with the same goal of improving his performance. He claims that he had less success with the tool in this regard than he had with respect to lowering the Complainant's call response time.\n[17] According to the Complainant, the fact that his report-writing was being timed placed additional stress on him, which in turn affected his output. Moreover, he points out that unlike the other recruits, he was not permitted to write his reports using the computers available at the detachment and in the patrol car. Had he been permitted to do so, he would have been able to make corrections on-screen before printing and verify the text with a spell-checking utility. Instead, Cst. Haney told him to handwrite his reports and often instructed him to rewrite them whenever something was found lacking. Sometimes he had to rewrite them more than once. This naturally ended up consuming even more time. Cst. Haney was also critical of the Complainant's handwriting, insisting that he print his letters and not use cursive writing when filling out forms and reports, or even when entering information in his notebook. The Complainant submits that his handwriting was neat and that these comments were unnecessary. He feels that he was singled out by Cst. Haney and was treated differently from the other recruits. Cst. Haney was of the view that it was important to learn to write reports by hand, as computers were not always available to officers. Neat handwriting was also viewed as essential by him. The coach who had trained Cst. Haney during his RFT had always insisted on these points. Cst. Haney wanted to pass the benefits of this training on to the Complainant.\n[18] Another of the tools used by Cst. Haney was a daily logbook. Starting in mid-December 1996, Cst. Haney began recording the Complainant's activities during each shift. At the end of the day, the Complainant would read the logbook and write a self-assessment of his performance on a scale of 1 to 3, from poor to excellent. The coach would then enter his own assessment based on the same scale, following which there would be some discussion about how their respective conclusions were reached. Cst. Haney wrote suggestions on how improvements could be made. On most days, they both gave identical scores, usually a 2. This rating system was used for a little over a month, ceasing only in mid-January 1997. However, Cst. Haney and other senior officers involved in the Complainant's training continued writing summaries of his performance in the logbook thereafter, up until the end of the initial RFT period. Cst. Haney testified that he used the logbook to identify and have the Complainant understand the deficiencies for which improvement was needed.\n[19] The Complainant was annoyed by the logbook. Its use began immediately following Cst. Haney's alleged outburst in the patrol car to which the Complainant had voiced his objections. It is his perception that the coach began using the logbook as a way to retaliate against him.\n[20] At the detachment's Christmas party, the Complainant had the opportunity to speak to his supervisor, Corporal (Cpl.) Peter Fischer, and complain about Cst. Haney's difficult approach and his yelling. Cpl. Fischer took the complaint under consideration. He consulted his own supervisor, Sergeant (Sgt.) Dwight Watts, and met with Cst. Haney to hear his point of view. The coach explained that deficiencies had been identified regarding the Complainant. Cst. Haney maintained that he was addressing these problems and trying to correct them in a manner that was not overly harsh. After having received this explanation, and mindful that the Complainant had not asked for a new trainer, Cpl. Fischer directed the Complainant to comply with the coach's instructions.\n[21] In a separate conversation in early January 1997, Sgt. Watts asked the Complainant if he wanted to change trainers for the balance of his field training. The Complainant turned down the offer. He explained at the hearing that because things were already going so badly for him, he did not want to worsen them by developing an image as someone who flees from a difficult situation. Two other witnesses at the hearing, Cst. Maxime St-Fleur and Cst. Oakland Knight, gave evidence that they requested and were provided with new trainers during their RFT at the Burnaby detachment. Interestingly, both of these recruits were also black and Cst. St-Fleur was a francophone of Haitian origin from Quebec, just like the Complainant. They did not pass their RFT after the initial six-month period and were only successful after having their RFT extended by several months. They are both active regular members of the RCMP today.\n[22] On January 20, 1997, Cst. Haney issued the Field Coaching Program Assessment Report for the Complainant at the two-month point. The Complainant testified that he had expected a fairly positive evaluation, based on the entries in the logbook, where the average rating of 2 predominated. Assessment Reports contained a grid listing 28 criteria on the basis of which candidates were rated superior, competent or needing improvement. It came as a shock to the Complainant to learn that Cst. Haney had marked him as needing improvement in ten of the categories. These areas included his ability to define problems, his aptitude at communicating in writing, his knowledge and application of law, policy and procedures, his proficiency at information gathering, and his investigation and evidence gathering skills. His driving and officer safety skills were also noted as deficient, as was his decision-making ability.\n[23] The Assessment Report form contained a section where the recruit would provide his own remarks. The Complainant wrote that he agreed with Cst. Haney's comments and that he was willing to improve his English grammar. He added that he appreciated the training given by his coach so far and would do his best to improve his skills in the future.\n[24] The Complainant testified that in reality, he did not agree at all with Cst. Haney's assessment of his performance, noting that he was not found lacking in any of the identified areas when he graduated from Depot. Several witnesses remarked, however, that one's achievements within the academic environment at Depot do not necessarily ensure similar success in the real-world environment experienced while training in the field. Cst. Haney testified that in any event, finding a trainee in need of improvement merely meant that some work was required in order for the candidate to meet the required standard. He noted that many of the Complainant's deficiencies were intertwined with one another. For instance, he had observed that the Complainant had a poor knowledge of provincial and municipal statutes and regulations enforced by the RCMP at the Burnaby detachment. This resulted in the making of ill-advised decisions in various areas, such as crime scene investigations and evidence gathering. Cst. Haney pointed out that he had included words of encouragement in the Assessment Report as well. He made the point of writing that the Complainant is an intelligent individual who has the ability to succeed. He also recognized in the report that some of the difficulties experienced by the Complainant in his drafting may have been because English was his second language.\n[25] The Complainant was particularly upset that the Report failed to mention any of the positive or commendable acts performed by him during the course of the first two months of training. One incident that stood out related to a patron in a local restaurant where the Complainant and Cst. Haney were also eating on November 27, 1996. The Complainant noticed that the man began choking on some food, and was unable to breathe. The Complainant intervened immediately and applied the Heimlich manoeuvre to dislodge the obstruction, while Cst. Haney called on his radio for an emergency response team. The Complainant's efforts were successful and the patron's life was saved. Following the incident, Cst. Haney merely commented to the Complainant that he had done a good job, by the way, as they sat back down at their table to finish their meals.\n[26] Back at the police station, the Complainant claims that Cst. Haney made no particular effort to inform any superior officers about his actions nor were they reported in any official manner to other members of the RCMP at the detachment. Cst. Haney testified that both he and the Complainant recounted the story to their colleagues and supervisors when they returned to the station. But Cst. Haney did not think it appropriate that a memo be drafted up and circulated by him applauding their own deeds. It would have been viewed as self-promotion. Such recognition was better left to their supervisors. Indeed, several days later, following the receipt at the detachment of a letter from the restaurant patron, thanking the Complainant and Cst. Haney for saving his life, Superintendent R.W. Fenske, who was the officer in charge of the Burnaby Detachment, wrote a memorandum commending them for their conduct. A copy of the letter was placed in the Complainant's personnel file. Yet no similar mention of the Complainant's actions was included in the two-month Assessment Report prepared by Cst. Haney.\n[27] Interestingly, Cst. Haney's involvement in the incident was specifically mentioned with commendation in his annual performance review, prepared by his supervisor some months later. Cpl. Fischer testified that annual performance reviews differ from RFT Performance Assessments. Annual performance reviews are intended to reflect all of an officer's documented exploits, whether positive or negative. Had the Complainant passed his RFT, the event would have been recorded in his annual performance review as well. On the other hand, Performance Assessment Reports are only concerned with documenting whether a recruit has reached the level of competence in each of the Field Training Standard's 28 criteria.\nC. Field Training - Months 3 & 4 [28] Over the next two months, Cst. Haney noted some improvement in the Complainant's skills but he remained dissatisfied with respect to certain areas assessed. The trainer was particularly troubled with the quality of the Complainant's note-taking and report-writing. Cst. Haney had advised the trainee to adopt the trainer's own rather formal style of taking notes. It appears that the Complainant did not emulate this style but evidence was led by other members of the RCMP that ordinarily, officers could adopt their own note-taking method, provided there was sufficient clarity for subsequent use at court proceedings. Cst. Haney remarked that no matter which note-taking method is employed, certain facts must be recorded under all circumstances, and the Complainant was failing to do so, even as he neared the end of his fourth month of training.\n[29] On the issue of report-writing, Cst. Haney continued to find that the Complainant had difficulty putting the right information into his documentation and that he took too long to prepare it. Yet Cst. Haney was confident that the Complainant could do better. On at least one occasion when the Complainant was instructed to redo his report, the final outcome was much improved. There are numerous entries made in Cst. Haney's logbook during this period in which he states that the Complainant is capable of achieving success with greater effort. The logbook also documents increasing resistance from the Complainant whenever instructed to redo his work.\n[30] Cst. Haney also identified problems relating to the Complainant's decision-making while in the field. The trainer advised that the Complainant needed to augment his knowledge base of law, policy and procedures, in order to improve in this area. Cst. Haney also encouraged the Complainant to ask questions and draw from the experience of others to assist in his decision-making.\n[31] The Complainant, on the other hand, disputes these assessments and accuses Cst. Haney of not fulfilling his duty to properly train him. According to the RCMP's Field Coaching Program Training Standard, trainers were expected to interact respectfully with their trainees and establish a positive work relationship. The recruit was supposed to feel comfortable with his or her coach. The coach in turn was to lead by example. Such a rapport never developed between the Complainant and Cst. Haney. The trainer's constant criticisms left the Complainant extremely uncomfortable. He would go to work wondering what else would be found deficient about him that day.\n[32] If his skills were lacking in some way, he contends that his trainer did not provide him with sufficient feedback on how to improve them. The Complainant was left to better himself on his own. He therefore enrolled in an English language training course. He began studying the applicable statutes and regulations, and he viewed numerous training video cassettes in his off-hours, usually at the detachment. He often stayed in the office after work. Despite these extra efforts, the Complainant alleges that Cst. Haney did not offer any positive reinforcement. To the contrary, one day in late February 1997, Cst. Haney told the Complainant that the police officer's profession was not for him and that he should consider changing careers. The Complainant replied defiantly that he wanted to succeed and would not resign.\n[33] Despite the lack of support from his coach, the Complainant felt confident that with all the extra effort he was expending, his assessment for the second two-month period would improve. Part of his confidence stemmed from the fact that he began patrolling the district on his own starting in late January 1997. He was more relaxed without his trainer next to him, and felt comfortable enough to meet any challenges that he faced. Cst. Haney testified that the Complainant, as is the case with all recruits when they do their first solo patrols, was shadowed by his coach and other officers in separate vehicles during these shifts. Consequently, Cst. Haney backed up the Complainant and arrived on the scene on all but the most routine calls. Cst. Haney recalls that while on these solo patrols, the Complainant on several occasions failed to follow appropriate procedures in responding to calls and investigating incidents.\n[34] The four-month Assessment Report, prepared on March 17, 1997, confirmed that the Complainant had improved to the level of competence in several areas, namely his driving and officer safety skills, as well as his abilities to define problems and gather information. But Cst. Haney also concluded that the trainee still needed improvement in his communication skills, and his knowledge of law, policy and procedures. In addition, he needed to improve his skills at taking statements and at taking control of situations when responding to an incident. In all, Cst. Haney deemed the Complainant as needing improvement with respect to six of the 28 criteria, down from the ten cited in the two-month Assessment Report. The trainer encouraged the Complainant to remain positive and determined during the final two months of the RFT, and urged him to devote an extra effort to the development of his skills. Cst. Haney set out a list of activities to assist the Complainant in improving his knowledge of law, policy and procedures, which included attending a series of weekly off-duty tutorial sessions with Cst. Haney.\n[35] The Complainant was disappointed with the Report. It was clear in his mind that he was facing an injustice. Despite all his hard work and efforts, his situation was not improving. He was in perpetual conflict with Cst. Haney and it was evident that the trainer wanted him to fail. The Complainant believes that Cst. Haney's intentions were rooted in prejudice against him and his colour. The Complainant says an incident that occurred just prior to the preparation of the four-month Assessment Report confirms his suspicion.\n[36] While both he and Cst. Haney were changing into their uniforms in the locker room at the police station one day, the trainer called the Complainant Kirby Puckett Ass. The Complainant claims that he took offence at the remark, actually interpreting the first word as being curvy and viewing it as a reference to the physical features of his lower torso. More importantly, he associated it with certain racial stereotypes regarding persons of African ancestry. The Complainant would only come to learn later on, when he contacted the Canadian Human Rights Commission to file his complaint, that Kirby Puckett is a well-known African-American baseball player. The Complainant testified that Cst. Haney used the term (as well as OBO) numerous times, right until the end of training with this coach, in May 1997. The Complainant says that he never expressly voiced an objection to the term since his career depended on Cst. Haney's assessment and he did not want to risk a confrontation with him.\n[37] Cst. Haney does not deny using the term Kirby Puckett Ass, but offers a context for the remark. He and the Complainant, together with several other officers, had been involved in a chase of a suspect on foot and by car through the streets of Burnaby. Cpl. Fischer later issued a memo congratulating all of the officers on their excellent job apprehending the individual. At one point during the pursuit, while Cst. Haney was running after the suspect, the Complainant got out of his patrol car and gave chase on foot as well, behind Cst. Haney. Back at the police station some time later, Cst. Haney asked the Complainant why he chose to leave the vehicle and run behind him. The Complainant answered that he was a faster runner than the coach and it would have been easier for him to catch up to the suspect. Cst. Haney disagreed and they engaged in a back and forth conversation trying to convince each other who is faster. At some point during this discussion, Cst. Haney called the Complainant, in what he described as an ironic, satirical tone, Kirby Puckett Ass.\n[38] Cst. Haney was aware that Kirby Puckett is an extremely powerful baseball player known to have a large, powerful torso, who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame because of his athletic talent. His comment therefore related to the running prowess being claimed by the Complainant, whom he viewed as a fit individual of a muscular build and appearance similar to Kirby Puckett's. The sarcastic tone was meant to imply that although the Complainant was claiming to possess the ability of Kirby Puckett, in actual fact he did not. The player's race did not cross Cst. Haney's mind and he never intended to use the term as a racial epithet. Cst. Haney recalls that this conversation was very jovial in nature. In fact, the Complainant turned to another officer walking by and told him what Cst. Haney had just said. The other person replied that this was OK because sometimes we all call [Cst. Haney] `Dumbo', a nickname that alluded to the shape of his ears. When the Complainant heard this, he bent over laughing as he repeated the word Dumbo back to himself several times. Cst. Haney claims that the Complainant called him Dumbo other times thereafter.\n[39] Cst. Haney insists that he used the term Kirby Puckett Ass in no more than five instances, and only within days of this discussion in the locker room. He maintains that the Complainant never objected to the use of the term and that had he done so, the trainer would have ceased using it immediately. Overall, according to Cst. Haney, he and the Complainant used nicknames very infrequently, and called each other by their proper first names 99% of the time.\n[40] The Complainant claims that Cst. Haney's attitude outside the workplace demonstrated a prejudice against him as well. The Complainant's fianc\u00e9e, Natalie Cerrato, joined him in Burnaby in late December 1996. She worked at a local sandwich shop as well as at the detachment, as a volunteer. Cst. Haney knew her and yet, when she served him at the sandwich shop a few times or when they sometimes crossed paths at the detachment, he ignored her. Furthermore, aside from a couple of occasions, Cst. Haney and the Complainant never socialized together on their days off work. The coach never invited the Complainant and his fianc\u00e9e together to his home.\n[41] Several RCMP officers testified, however, that it was not necessarily a normal practice for members to develop personal friendships amongst themselves and to meet outside of work. Cst. Haney stated in his testimony that there was always an open invitation extended to the Complainant to visit his home in Coquitlam, and indeed, he had come over several times during the first weeks of the RFT. But Cst. Haney also noted that by the time Ms. Cerrato arrived in Burnaby, his relationship with the Complainant had already become strained at work. It had evolved almost exclusively into a trainer\/recruit relationship. There was a separation in their roles, which may have translated into a little additional stress that even extended to his contacts with Ms. Cerrato. Cst. Haney added that he did not recall ever being invited over to the Complainant's home.\nD. Field Training - Months 5 & 6 [42] As they entered the fifth month of the RFT, Cst. Haney commenced the weekly law, policy and procedures tutorial sessions with the Complainant, which he had recommended in the four-month Assessment Report. The Complainant acknowledges that these sessions were organized at the coach's initiative. Cst. Haney conducted them at his home, outside of working hours. Both he and the Complainant received an overtime allowance for this activity. The meetings lasted for hours at a time during which they reviewed a multitude of scenarios. The sessions ceased after the third week, probably because Cst. Haney was away from the detachment on training. They never resumed, to the disappointment of the Complainant. Cst. Haney testified that he had not intended to tutor the Complainant to the end of the RFT. The goal was to determine in which areas the Complainant was still deficient, and thereafter it would be up to the trainee to concentrate his studies even further in those areas.\n[43] As in the preceding period, the Complainant and Cst. Haney only occasionally worked together in the same patrol car during the fifth and sixth months of the RFT. The Complainant regularly drove solo. He also completed rotations in other sections of the detachment as is required of all recruits.\n[44] On April 27, 1997, Cst. Michel Merritt arrived on the scene of a call to which the Complainant, who was working solo, had been dispatched as primary responder. A landlord and a tenant had engaged in a dispute regarding the use of the leased premises, which had developed into a shoving match. Cst. Merritt later criticized the Complainant for concentrating too much on trying to resolve the civil dispute between the parties and not focussing on the criminal assault investigation for which he had been called to the scene to conduct. Cst. Merritt noted this observation in the logbook.\n[45] Cst. Haney prepared the final Assessment Report on May 17, 1997. He concluded that the Complainant needed improvement in the same six areas cited in the second report but added that improvement was also needed in a seventh field: records management. The coach provided a detailed narrative with the report, which referenced several incidents in support of his findings.\n[46] The concern regarding the Complainant's record management skills stemmed from his difficulty in keeping his files current and responding promptly to requests made by his supervisors, Crown counsel and others. Cst. Haney noted that the Complainant was extremely unorganized and he failed to adopt several suggestions to improve this weakness. Files were often found torn and tattered at the bottom of his duty bag. The Complainant brought the bag with him to the hearing. It is soft-sided and resembles an athletic bag. In my view, it is not a case in which one would ordinarily expect to see files carried.\n[47] Cst. Haney noted that he still had some concerns about the Complainant's communication skills in his second language, but was pleased to see that he had enrolled in English courses outside of working hours. Of greater concern was the Complainant's ability to prepare his incident reports and all related documents without undue delay. Cst. Haney found that the reports were often inadequate and lacked the necessary detail, which resulted in their having to be done over, thereby further delaying their completion. According to Cst. Haney, the Complainant still required considerable guidance and supervision in the drafting of documents.\n[48] The trainer remarked that the Complainant had notably upgraded his knowledge of law, policy and procedures over the previous months, but further improvement was still needed. Several instances where this deficiency emerged were raised. While the Complainant was on a rotation with another unit of the detachment, a replica handgun was found and seized. There was an initial suspicion that the gun had been used in a series of robberies. The Complainant was assigned the task of processing the item as an exhibit for possible criminal charges. When he returned to the station, he was unable to locate any members of the General Investigation Section (GIS) to whom he was to hand over the gun. So he left it unattended in his office basket for several hours, thereby breaking the continuity of its possession. As things turned out, the initial suspicion regarding the gun's history was unfounded and no charges were laid. But according to Cst. Haney, the Complainant should have conducted himself as if the item was an exhibit. Cst. Haney confronted the Complainant over this matter. There was a strong reaction from the Complainant who protested that the trainer was being overly demanding.\n[49] The Complainant testified that he had felt wronged by Cst. Haney's criticism. He had only placed the gun in his basket after having been told by the investigating GIS member back at the crime scene that no criminal charges were going to be laid relating to the gun and that the Complainant should dispose of it. In these circumstances, the continuity of its possession was no longer of any relevance. The Complainant tried to explain these facts to Cst. Haney but the coach refused to accept his explanation.\n[50] A similar incident occurred regarding the seizure of a small amount of marijuana in respect of which there was not going to be any prosecution, a so-called no case drug seizure. The Complainant was instructed to take possession of the seized drugs and initiate the process for their destruction. This required that he complete a fairly complex form. Instead of doing so immediately, the Complainant decided to store the narcotics in his duty locker for a month, in contravention of detachment and RCMP policy. Cst. Haney wrote in the Assessment Report that this was due to the Complainant's procrastination. He added in his testimony that if the Complainant found the task of filling out the form daunting, he should have sought out assistance, instead of just leaving a controlled substance to sit in his locker. Cst. Haney was particularly concerned that this type of error was still occurring six months into his field training.\n[51] The Complainant disagrees entirely with how Cst. Haney presented these events in his Report. The drugs were seized while the Complainant was on rotation in a neighbourhood liaison unit under the supervision of Constable Anthony Akow. After the suspects in possession of the narcotics had been detained, Cst. Akow directed the Complainant to store the drugs in his locker until such time as the suspects were interviewed and a decision was made on whether to charge them with an offence. One week later, and in each of the ensuing two weeks, the Complainant asked Cst. Akow if a decision had been made and he was told no. Finally, about one month after the date of the seizure, Cst. Akow told the Complainant that charges would not be laid and instructed him to proceed with the destruction of the drugs. Accordingly, he completed the requisite form pursuant to RCMP standards. It was when Cst. Haney saw the recruit filling out this form that he accused him of having procrastinated and not complied with the applicable policy and procedure. The Complainant attempted to explain several times over that he was simply following orders, but Cst. Haney refused to listen and did not try to consult Cst. Akow for confirmation of the Complainant's explanation. The Complainant testified that he felt crushed and victimized by the treatment he received at his coach's hands.\n[52] The Complainant called Cst. Akow as a witness at the hearing. His account of the facts is not consistent with the Complainant's. He recalls telling the Complainant on the very evening of the seizure that no charges would be laid and that he should proceed with the drugs' destruction. He remembers that some weeks later, he happened to run into the Complainant at the detachment. Cst. Akow was working out of a satellite police station at the time and only rarely visited the main office. The Complainant informed him that he had yet to dispose of the drugs. Cst. Akow was surprised to hear this and recalls advising the Complainant that if he did not know what procedure to follow, he should seek the advice of his trainer or another officer. The Complainant did not tell Cst. Akow at this time that he had been storing the marijuana in his duty locker. Cst. Akow only learned of this fact shortly before testifying at the Tribunal hearing. In his opinion, this form of storage was inappropriate. There were two designated sets of lockers at the police station where exhibits were secured temporarily pending further processing, and that is where the Complainant should have placed the seized substances. The Complainant should have been aware of these lockers, and if not, he should have asked his trainer or another officer for advice.\n[53] On the issue of the Complainant's evidence gathering skills, Cst. Haney remarked in the final Assessment Report that the Complainant's notes were still incomplete. Important observations were frequently not recorded in his notebook and significant details, such as dates of birth, phone numbers and times, were often lacking.\n[54] The Complainant's ability to deal with members of the public was also identified as problematic. Cst. Haney referred in the final Assessment Report to two incidents where the Complainant engaged in a shouting match with members of the public. His confrontational approach was unprofessional and not acceptable.\n[55] Cst. Haney also reiterated his concerns about the Complainant's decision-making skills, adding that they would likely improve as he upgraded his knowledge and application of law, policy and procedures. The coach encouraged the Complainant to seek out the advice of senior RCMP members and experts in order to further enhance these skills. Cst. Haney also noted that the Complainant needed to begin taking a common sense approach when dealing with situations. As an example, the coach highlighted an incident where the Complainant returned a recovered stolen vehicle to an individual without first verifying the person's identification and vehicle registration. The Complainant countered in his evidence that he knew the individual from before and had spoken to him in French before returning the vehicle. He had established with confidence that this person was in fact the car dealer who had reported the theft. The Complainant's attempts at explaining this to Cst. Haney were rebuked yet again.\n[56] Cst. Haney concluded in his Report that in general the Complainant's work ethic was suspect and required improvement. He tended to deflect criticisms that were intended for his benefit and he had the habit of comparing himself to other cadets being trained at Burnaby instead of focussing on what he needed in order to become successful. Nonetheless, Cst. Haney indicated that with a greater effort and a willingness to learn, the Complainant could succeed in the Field Training Program. He therefore recommended that the Complainant's training period be extended. The non-commissioned officer who was in charge of training at Burnaby, Cpl. Richard Cousins, testified that while in theory a recruit who does not pass his initial six-month RFT can be recommended for discharge, in his experience, the training period of all recruits is ordinarily extended in such circumstances. According to Cpl. Cousins, failing to satisfy all the criteria at the end of the initial period does not indicate an inability to succeed but rather that the individual needs more coaching and more development to meet the standards.\n[57] The Complainant took issue with the final Assessment Report prepared by Cst. Haney. He recalls that despite its somewhat optimistic conclusion, Cst. Haney told the Complainant several weeks before the Report's completion that it was by no means certain an extension would be recommended for him. He openly questioned whether the Complainant was destined to have a police career. These remarks had the obvious effect of further discouraging the Complainant, who had been making a tremendous effort to improve himself.\n[58] The Complainant was particularly upset at the assertions in the Report that he had not applied himself sufficiently and was unwilling to work hard. He claims that Cst. Haney often accused him during the RFT of being lazy and slow. Aside from being unfounded, the Complainant argues that these statements demonstrated an underlying racial prejudice associated with a negative stereotype of black persons as lazy and lethargic. The communication of these accusations by Cst. Haney to supervisors and other RCMP members served to irreversibly taint his reputation at the detachment.\n[59] Contrary to the findings of his trainer, the Complainant felt very comfortable by this point in his role as a police officer. He was at ease going on solo patrols and handling any form of call to which he had been exposed in the past.\n[60] He was again frustrated that none of the many positive or outstanding acts executed by him over the course of the previous two months were mentioned. For instance, although he was criticized for placing a suspect's replica gun in his office basket, the Complainant had at the same time taken the initiative to search the detainee's background, and uncovered that he was an illegal immigrant against whom a deportation order had been issued. As a result, the suspect was kept in detention and then handed over to the immigration authorities.\n[61] Another incident of good conduct that was not reported took place on April 16, 1997. While on rotation with another unit, the Complainant was heading to the courthouse with Constable C.L. Ramos in an unmarked police car. As they were travelling, the Complainant observed someone trying to break into a parked vehicle. They stopped and apprehended the suspect, who it turned out was in possession of stolen property and had a record of violence. Cst. Ramos drafted up a memo (known as a 1004 Performance Log) commending the Complainant for his enthusiasm and fine work ethic. Several supervisors endorsed the memo and praised him with remarks such as good work and excellent.\n[62] Two days later, on April 18, 1997, the Complainant was assigned to work with Constable R.S. Burns, on rotation with another unit, and was again riding as a passenger in an unmarked police car. He witnessed two persons running away from an apparent altercation with a third individual. The Complainant got out of the car and pursued both suspects on foot. After apprehending and securing the first, he continued the chase and caught the second suspect as well. Both of them were the object of an ongoing assault and kidnapping investigation. Cst. Burns later noted that the Complainant exhibited considerable enthusiasm in apprehending the individuals and that his decision to intervene was correct. This event was not mentioned in the Assessment Report but Cst. Haney testified that he was only made aware of the incident just prior to his testimony in the present case.\n[63] The Complainant points out that even his work within the broader community was omitted from the Report. For example, no mention was made of his having volunteered to present scenarios to students attending the 1997 Youth Academy, a project organized to acquaint young people with the RCMP. The officer in charge of the event later sent a letter to the Burnaby detachment expressing gratitude for the Complainant's contribution.\n[64] Cst. Haney disagrees with the intimation that the Complainant's successes during his training were ignored. To the contrary, the coach contends that they were incorporated in his general assessment. Ultimately, however, the objective of the Assessment Report and the Field Training Program as a whole was to establish whether the recruit was competent under all the designated criteria. The Field Coaching Program Training Standard, which served as an operational manual for RFTs, stipulated that in preparing Assessment Reports, field coaches were to only document observations of performances that were either in need of improvement or were superior. In the absence of any such mention, the recruit was assumed to be competent in all areas. Where something noticeably wrong was observed, the trainer was supposed to provide suggestions for remedial action in the report. In addition, Cst. Haney added that his role as a trainer was to provide the Complainant with an accurate, open and honest impression of the level of his performance. In Cst. Haney's opinion, to emphasize the achievements at the cost of minimizing the deficiencies would have been dishonest and would have negatively impacted on the Complainant's training.\n[65] Under the Trainee's Comments section of the final Assessment Report, the Complainant did not express any open objection, having resigned himself to the situation. He noted that he had been working very hard over the previous two months but understood that he still needed to work more in certain areas. He accepted the extension to his RFT and declared that he would prove his competence in all areas.\nE. First Extension of Field Training - Month #1 [66] Cpl. Cousins, who headed the training program, accepted Cst. Haney's recommendation that the Complainant's training period be extended for three months. In an effort to start things anew, it was decided that he would be moved into another district of the city to work with new peers and supervisors, and a new trainer. He would still be working out of the detachment's main building. For his part, the Complainant asked his team supervisor, Sgt. Watts, if he could be assigned a bilingual coach this time. Cst. Haney did not speak French, and the Complainant felt that in some instances he may have been better understood by the coach had he been able to express himself in his first language.\n[67] Sgt. Watts designated Cst. Dave Carr, whom he considered very competent and well-respected by his peers, as the trainer for the extension period. Cst. Carr held an official language (ie. bilingual) position. The Complainant submits however that in fact, Cst. Carr could barely speak a sentence in French. He testified that at no time was he able to express himself and get his point across to the new trainer in French, particularly in decision-making situations. On the other hand, Cst. Carr gave evidence that he deliberately spoke to the Complainant almost exclusively in English since the latter's English language skills were still in need of improvement.\n[68] The extension of the Complainant's field training began on June 13, 1997. He met with Cst. Carr and Corporal Lyle Avery, who became his new supervisor. They discussed his problem areas and set out a list of corrective actions. These included an undertaking by the Complainant to study the writing skills and style of other members, to ride along in patrol cars with other officers during his off-hours, and to implement Cst. Carr's system of personal organization. It was agreed that the lines of communication between the three of them would be open at all times. Cpl. Avery underscored the point that both he and Cst. Carr wanted the Complainant to succeed.\n[69] The Complainant's reaction to this action plan was mixed. He was personally upset that the RCMP had not seen fit to pass him on his field training, but outwardly he maintained a positive and open attitude toward these guidelines. After all, his greatest desire was to succeed.\n[70] The Complainant testified that Cst. Carr's training style was in marked contrast to that of Cst. Haney in several respects. Cst. Carr permitted him to use the available computers to draft his documents, which allowed him to write up his reports much more quickly. In addition, Cst. Carr's tone was very professional and he did not yell at the Complainant. He did not address him using either of the allegedly racial epithets used by his former trainer (OBO and Kirby Puckett Ass). Cst. Carr testified that he had previously heard the story regarding the Complainant's mistaken use of the term OBO but he had not heard of the term Kirby Puckett Ass until he saw the Complainant and Cst. Albert exchange messages on the patrol car's mobile computer one day. Cst. Albert used the term to address the Complainant, who in turn used a nickname to address Cst. Albert in reply. The Complainant explained to Cst. Carr that Kirby Puckett Ass was a nickname that had been given to him once. He did not express any displeasure in its use.\n[71] Cst. Carr did nonetheless carry over some of Cst. Haney's training techniques. For instance, he relied on a logbook to record events on a daily basis. The Complainant claims that even the slightest error on his part ended up being documented in Cst. Carr's book. Cst. Carr also kept track of how long it took the Complainant to complete his reports. Each time he would make a mistake, Cst. Carr would openly question how this could happen to someone with more than six months' experience in the field. The Complainant's attempts to blame his deficiencies on what he perceived as the poor level of training he had received from Cst. Haney were dismissed by Cst. Carr. This had a chilling effect on the Complainant, who became reluctant to ask questions and learn how to execute a given task, which further aggravated the problem.\n[72] A conversation that he had with Cst. Carr and Cpl. Avery several weeks into the extension only added to the frustration he was feeling. Both of the more senior members tried to convince him to consider resigning and take up another profession. Their comments were very upsetting. He thought their opinions of him were unfounded and unfair. He could not understand why he was given an extension on his RFT if they were so certain that he would not pass. How could they claim that he was starting anew, when they had already prejudged him? He felt crushed.\n[73] Cst. Carr disagrees. He and Cpl. Avery wanted to speak to the Complainant about his progress to that point. It was clear that he continued to have difficulties in his training and they felt it appropriate to propose that he consider a career other than police work. Cst. Carr believed it to be in the best interest of a trainee to be open and frank with him.\n[74] The Complainant's alleged ongoing deficiencies were identified in the first Assessment Report of the extension period, prepared at the one-month point and dated August 3, 1997. Cst. Carr concluded that the Complainant still needed improvement in six of the seven areas where he had been found deficient in Cst. Haney's final Report. He had upgraded himself to the level of competency in the seventh area, incident and risk management.\n[75] Cst. Carr testified that the Complainant had actually demonstrated competence in several of the categories for which a need for improvement had been identified, such as in his knowledge of law, policy and procedure and his records management. But this improvement had only just occurred in the days and weeks prior to the filing of the Report and Cst. Carr felt it inappropriate to upgrade the Complainant until a level of consistency over a longer period had been shown.\n[76] The coach felt that the Complainant remained clearly deficient in several of the other fields. Communication skills remained a challenge for the Complainant. His continued difficulty with written English made paperwork a formidable task for him. But Cst. Carr noted that the Complainant even had difficulties with the format of reports and that he was unsure about what information needed to be included. These problems resulted in his taking an inordinate amount of time to complete a report, often necessitating two or three drafts before finalization. Cst. Carr remarked that because paperwork was so cumbersome for the Complainant, he had a propensity to avoid this task.\n[77] The Complainant questions the validity of this assessment. He points to the evidence of Constable Dana Lillies, who replaced Cst. Carr as coach for a total of ten work shifts in July 1997. She noted in the logbook that the Complainant's paperwork was satisfactory, with the wording only in need of some fine tuning in the odd sentence. She did not identify any problem in the content of the reports. Overall, she did not observe any major problem in his performance, although she acknowledges that all the calls that they attended were relatively routine in nature. In one case, the Complainant reacted quickly and chased down on foot a detained suspect who had managed to run away from the patrol car.\n[78] Cst. Carr also noted that the Complainant demonstrated a lack of common sense and made decisions that defied logic. For instance, while at a scene where someone had died, a so-called sudden death call, he opted to tape a statement from a witness with the deceased's body still present, in an environment with considerable noise and commotion. The Complainant was later advised that a written statement would have been more appropriate in such circumstances. A few weeks later, the Complainant attended the scene of a purse snatching. He opted yet again to take a taped statement from the victim, who was very upset, under a noisy Skytrain commuter train platform, with people streaming by. A short written statement would have been more suitable. The Complainant asserts that this criticism was unfair. On account of his being constantly timed in the execution of his tasks, the Complainant had become accustomed to taping statements, which is a quicker process than writing them down.\n[79] Cst. Carr also identified a difficulty with the Complainant's ability to make appropriate decisions on whether or not to charge someone. In one incident, he opted to not charge a young offender without having first conducted a background check. It turned out that the individual had been given a warning before, a factor to consider before deciding whether to charge a suspect. In another case, the Complainant proceeded immediately with charges in a case where the assault was minor and where the public interest clearly called for informal resolution between the parties involved. Cst. Carr stated that he and the Complainant had put together a strategy to develop the latter's common sense and logic in handling situations, which would be implemented over the remaining two months in the extension period. Still and all, despite his concerns, the coach did recognize in the report that the Complainant had been making some good decisions of late.\n[80] With respect to crime scene investigation and evidence gathering skills, it was noted that the Complainant had overcome the problems with his notebook. But Cst. Carr was concerned that the Complainant often appeared content to let other members take over at the scene of an incident rather than deal with the matter himself.\n[81] In his general conclusions, Cst. Carr mentioned his concurrence with Cst. Haney's finding that the Complainant deflected responsibility from himself. He frequently blamed Cst. Haney for the difficulties that he was continuing to experience. Cst. Carr mentioned in his Report that whenever the Complainant's inability to use common sense and make logical decisions was raised, he appeared unable to grasp the concept and invariably placed the blame on someone else who had told him to do things that way.\n[82] As with the previous Assessment Reports, the Complainant provided his own remarks on the form, after having viewed the document. He wrote that he had made enormous efforts since the start of his RFT extension and that he would keep on doing his best until the end.\nF. First Extension of Field Training - Month #2 [83] Cst. Carr acknowledged in the next Assessment Report, dated August 31, 1997, that the Complainant had indeed stepped up his efforts during the second month of his extension. It was noted that the Complainant rode along with other officers during his days off. One of the RCMP members with whom he rode was Cst. Luc Montmarquette, who later wrote a 1004 Performance Log documenting his observations. He found the Complainant to have handled his calls in a professional manner without any problems and to have displayed good judgment in dealing with victims. Cst. Montmarquette gave evidence, however, that they only responded to minor calls during their shifts together. The circumstances therefore did not permit him to assess whether the Complainant possessed all of the qualities required of a police officer.\n[84] The Complainant also asked to ride with another officer, Cst. Randy Marx, for one eight-hour shift. In the 1004 Performance Log that Cst. Marx completed thereafter, he noted that the Complainant had led the investigation on one assault call and that he acted in a very professional manner. Cst. Marx did identify a bit of a language barrier that affected conversations and report-writing, but he was confident these difficulties would be smoothed over in time. Overall, he felt that the Complainant was performing his duties at an expected level. Cst. Marx said that he would have no hesitation working with him in the future.\n[85] Interestingly, however, Cst. Marx prepared a supplemental 1004 Performance Log five days later in which he seemed to downplay some of the positive comments in his earlier memo. He underscored the fact that his evaluation was made based only upon one shift and that he could therefore not provide a comprehensive assessment of the Complainant's performance. Cst. Marx recognized in the Performance Log that the Complainant may have been feeling that he was being poorly assessed by his trainers, but he also added that had he worked with the trainee for a month or two, it is possible that he would have reached the same conclusion as they had. Cst. Marx testified that after preparing the first 1004 Performance Log, he had learned of the difficulties that the Complainant had been having in completing his RFT. He then realized that his first report could have been misinterpreted and felt it important to clarify the exact parameters of what he had written. Cpl. Avery faintly recalls having spoken to Cst. Marx about the first Performance Log and telling Cst. Marx that it would be appropriate to only document actual observations and refrain from making additional overly broad statements without having had the benefit of working consistently with the trainee.\n[86] The Assessment Report recorded several improvements from the previous assessment. The Complainant was now considered competent in the areas of records management as well as knowledge and application of law, policy and procedure. However, he remained in need of improvement under three of the criteria.\n[87] Cst. Carr continued to find the Complainant's communication skills deficient. On account of an ongoing problem with his written English, preparing reports remained a cumbersome task for the Complainant. Two drafts were usually necessary to produce an acceptable report, the initial version often requiring proofreading by someone else. To help the Complainant improve his report writing skills, Cst. Carr had begun providing him with hypothetical scenarios on audiotape. The Complainant would listen to the tapes and practice writing up reports to Crown Counsel thereafter. The reports were then proofread and corrected by the trainer. In addition, the Complainant registered himself to take a course in effective writing offered by the RCMP. In this regard, Cst. Carr expressed some disappointment that since arriving in Burnaby, the Complainant had not sought out any other formal training in English.\n[88] The Complainant takes issue with this last remark and its implication that he had not done anything to improve his written English. In January 1997, he contacted E Division (British Columbia) headquarters in Vancouver for advice on the availability of English language training in the region. He was registered in the course to which he was referred at Capicollo College but upon receiving the course manual, he realized that the grammar instruction was insufficient. He therefore requested approval to take a more appropriate course being offered by correspondence by the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. The request was denied, as it was felt that training from within British Columbia should be favoured. Meanwhile, he registered himself in the RCMP's course on effective writing on his own initiative. None of his supervisors had ever informed him of the program's existence. The Complainant happened to learn of it from another officer, Cst. Albert, who had also taken the course.\n[89] The Complainant was also very upset with a comment addressed to him in this regard by his supervisor, Corporal Lyle Avery. When asked why his report-writing was taking so long, the Complainant explained that he was translating from French to English and then correcting spelling mistakes. Cpl. Avery retorted that his child was studying French at school and it was not taking him that long to do his homework. Cpl. Avery added that the delay could not have been due to the language barrier, but rather due to the Complainant's inability to draft reports. The Complainant believed he was misjudged. He felt humiliation at being compared to a schoolchild.\n[90] With respect to the Complainant's crime scene investigation and evidence gathering skills, Cst. Carr maintained that the Complainant had still not achieved the level of competence. The coach acknowledged that there had been improvement in areas such as the taking of statements and the earnestness with which he took calls. Yet Cst. Carr also identified several instances where the Complainant seemed unaware of the appropriate procedure to follow despite having been in similar situations numerous times before.\n[91] Aside from the weakness in report-writing, the Complainant's greatest problems were reportedly in the area of decision-making. Cst. Carr observed that in reaching decisions he tended to think in a linear fashion and had difficulty perceiving the big picture, which encompasses intangibles such as the public interest. Cst. Carr provided the Complainant with additional scenarios on audiotape for him to practice his decision-making skills. After listening to the facts of a case, the Complainant would determine whether or not to charge the suspect. Cst. Carr observed that as a result of these exercises, the Complainant had begun grasping the concept of taking the public interest into account.\n[92] Overall, Cst. Carr found that the Complainant had made progress in the previous month and that he had been working hard at improving his areas of weakness. Cpl. Avery, as supervisor to both Cst. Carr and the Complainant, added his comments to the Report. He highlighted the fact that the Complainant had to his credit achieved improved performance to a competent level in some areas that previously needed improvement. Cpl. Avery recognized the Complainant's continuing efforts to achieve competency in the three remaining categories and assured him that we will continue to provide all possible support.\nG. First Extension of Field Training - Month #3 [93] By September 30, 1997, when the third and final Assessment Report was issued, Cst. Carr had concluded that the Complainant had achieved the level of competence in the areas of communication skills, crime scene investigation, and evidence gathering. However, the Complainant's decision-making skills were still in need of improvement.\n[94] Cst. Carr noted that when he first began training the Complainant, this area was of particular concern. Initially, the issue related to his inability to decide whether or not to charge someone. Through practice and the use of scenarios, the Complainant improved and no further problems were noted. But Cst. Carr felt that the Complainant continued to have difficulty making decisions that are basic and fundamental to police work. He was still not looking at the big picture. He appeared to get excited and rush into decisions without considering what the consequences will be. Both Cst. Carr and Cst. Albert, who had trained the Complainant for a number of shifts in Cst. Carr's absence, had observed this problem and had advised him to slow down and think through his decisions before acting upon them.\n[95] Cst. Carr gave some specific examples in his Report of the errors in the Complainant's decision-making. While riding with Cst. Albert, the Complainant arrested a 15-year-old shoplifter. He opted to return her to the group home where she resided. Upon arriving there, he intended to just let her out of the patrol car and drive off. By not escorting her to the door and handing her over to the group home's staff, he ran a risk that she would run away from the home as soon as he was gone.\n[96] Another incident related to a call regarding a woman with bullet wounds to her chest, an apparent suicide attempt. Several officers were in attendance. Constable Peter Maw was supervising the operation. While Cst. Carr and another member performed first aid on the injured person, the Complainant was instructed to keep an eye on a man who was found at the scene, a potential suspect. A few minutes later, two GIS investigators arrived. They were initially unable to locate and interview the suspect. He was eventually found alone on a balcony, away from the crime scene, smoking a cigarette. The Complainant had apparently stepped outside to retrieve a tape recorder from a police vehicle and left the suspect unattended.\n[97] One of the investigators, Constable Theodore Van Overbeek, later complained about the Complainant's actions to Cpl. Avery. The Complainant denied any wrongdoing, contending that Cst. Maw, a more senior member, had instructed him to get the tape recorder. He understood that Cst. Maw would watch the suspect in the meantime. Cst. Maw disputed this assertion in his testimony. Interestingly, Cst. Van Overbeek later issued a 1004 Performance Log commending the Complainant on the manner in which he had gathered the evidence at this incident. Cst. Van Overbeek testified that he had prepared the memo at the request of Cst. Carr, who had explained that the Complainant was in need of some positive reinforcement.\n[98] Cst. Carr referred to another call in the Assessment Report as indicative of the Complainant's deficiencies in making decisions. They were dispatched to deal with a dispute between two teenaged sisters who had been fighting quite violently. Their parents were not present. After assessing the situation, the Complainant came to the decision that he would arrest both of them, so as to keep them apart. Cst. Carr criticized him for lacking forethought as to what he would do with two young offenders whom he had arrested without any intention of charging. It was not in the public interest that they be detained. A short time later, the sisters' mother arrived and the Complainant then decided to leave the matter with her. The Complainant agrees that his initial decision was not the best but he had never encountered a similar situation in the past. When he asked Cst. Carr for advice, the trainer insisted that he make a decision immediately.\n[99] Cst. Carr pointed out that whenever he spoke to the Complainant about his difficulty with decision-making, the recruit did not appear to believe there was a problem. According to Cst. Carr, the Complainant replied that any difficulties he was experiencing related to the pressure being placed on him and the problems that had existed between him and his first trainer, Cst. Haney. Cst. Carr dismissed this claim, stating that having worked with the Complainant for three and a half months, he had witnessed nothing to support the assertion. Cst. Carr added that difficulties between two individuals cannot affect one's ability to make sound decisions. Cst. Carr completed his Report by noting that the Complainant was well-liked by his co-workers, worked well with others, and was an enthusiastic member.\n[100] Cpl. Avery attached his own comments to those of Cst. Carr. He concurred with the trainer's findings. He noted that the problem for the Complainant lay in his being unable to function under pressure within a reasonable time frame as an integral part of a team with constant demands to action tasks at a high level of quality, while still being able to get on to the next call without constant supervision. Cpl. Avery added that in his opinion, the Complainant had the benefit of being trained by two excellent coaches.\n[101] After receiving the final Assessment Report, the Complainant returned home to Montreal for a couple of weeks. He was crushed and dejected at the near certainty that he would be dismissed for having failed to satisfy just one of the 28 criteria of the RFT. In the preceding months, the Complainant had been speaking to Cpl. Les Allen about the difficulties he had been experiencing. Cpl. Allen was involved with the Division Staff Relations Representative (DSRR) Program as a sub-representative responsible for the Burnaby detachment. Since RCMP members were not unionized, the DSRR Program had been established to represent their collective and individual interests within the RCMP. As it became obvious towards the end of the extension period that the Complainant may not satisfy all of the criteria of his RFT, Cpl. Allen began making it known to senior management that he would be requesting a second extension of the Complainant's RFT.\n[102] The decision on whether to grant a second extension to the Complainant was to be handled by Cpl. Cousins, Inspector (Insp.) Dennis Schlecker, who was the officer in charge of operations at the Burnaby Detachment, and Staff-Sergeant (Staff-Sgt.) Colin Abel, who was the Non-commissioned Officer in Charge of the Field Coaching Program for E Division. His role was to supervise the training being offered by all of the Division's detachments. While the Complainant was away in Montreal, several meetings were conducted to discuss his future with the RCMP. Sgt. Watts and Cst. Carr felt that the Complainant would be unable to overcome his deficiency regarding a crucial component of police work, the ability to make sound decisions. They recommended that the Complainant's training not be extended.\n[103] Cpl. Cousins was also reluctant to support a further extension, but he continued to believe that the Complainant had the potential to be a fully competent member. He testified that he was persuaded in this opinion by the representations of Cpl. Allen. Cpl. Cousins' recommendation for an extension of two months was given only on the condition that the Complainant accept the fact that he was lacking in the area of decision-making and that he would have to make a concerted effort to improve in that category. Cpl. Cousins felt that one of the reasons that the trainee had not managed to achieve full competency was his tendency to deflect responsibility for his shortcomings, and to meet any attempt by his trainers to correct them with resentment.\n[104] Insp. Schlecker adopted Cpl. Cousins' recommendations. The Complainant's RFT was extended for a period that Insp. Schlecker curiously described as no more than and no less than two (2) months in his memorandum to the officer in charge of the detachment. The assessment during the extension would be focussed on the Complainant's decision-making. A new field coach would be assigned to him with the understanding that he or she demonstrate and document with examples what had been done to assist the Complainant and what the results of this assistance had been. If the Complainant did not reach an acceptable level in decision-making, a recommendation for discharge would automatically follow.\n[105] Both Insp. Schlecker and Cpl. Cousins testified that this was the only occasion in their careers, during which they were involved in the training of hundreds of recruits, that they had come across a second extension of an RFT. Staff-Sgt. Abel gave evidence that the Field Coaching Program does not even formally provide for a second extension.\nH. Second Extension of Field Training - Weeks 1 & 2 [106] While in Montreal, the Complainant prepared his comments with respect to the final Assessment Report of September 30, 1997. The remarks were typed and were 14 pages in length. He took the opportunity to express his view on all of the previous Assessment Reports. He provided his perspective on some of the incidents for which he had been criticized. He pointed out that the Reports often failed to make mention of the positive aspects of his performance. In discussing the extension period, he mentioned that Cst. Carr was an excellent trainer. The Complainant added that Cst. Carr spent a lot of his own time to help him succeed, was patient with him and treated him fairly to the end. The Complainant did not provide any appraisal, positive or negative, about Cst. Haney. At no point in his remarks did the Complainant ever allege or suggest that either Cst. Haney or Cst. Carr treated him in a discriminatory fashion. The Complainant concluded his comments by noting that we all learn from our mistakes, and requested an additional training extension if it is the opinion of my superiors that decision-making skill [sic] still needs improvement.\n[107] The Complainant handed in his comments upon his return to the detachment in mid-October 1997. He had not been informed of the exchanges that his superiors had been having about his RFT. He had assumed that he would be dismissed. He only learned that his training had been extended when he arrived at the detachment on October 16, 1997, looked in his basket, and found a copy of Insp. Schlecker's memorandum that set out the conditions of the extension.\n[108] The Complainant was told that he would be working with an entirely new team of police officers and serving a different district in one of the busier areas of Burnaby. Sergeant Murray Ross, who was the Watch Commander for the team, was asked to designate a trainer for the Complainant. In consultation with the non-commissioned officer who would be in charge of the Complainant's patrol, Cpl. Larry Johnson, Sgt. Ross selected Cst. Dwayne McDonald as the new coach. Sgt. Ross described Cst. McDonald in his evidence as an excellent policeman who was very mature despite being a relatively junior member at the time. Cst. McDonald had trained other RCMP officers and, in his previous employment as a customs inspector, he had participated in the ongoing training of new customs officers.\n[109] On October 21, 1997, Cst. McDonald and Cpl. Johnson met with the Complainant to discuss the format that this training would take. It was agreed by the supervisors, and accepted by the Complainant, that he would ride with the coach for the entire duration of the extension. He was to be responsible for the handling, investigation and direction of all files, and Cst. McDonald would be available for assistance, only at the Complainant's request. Cst. McDonald was to assess the trainee solely with respect to his decision-making abilities and his activity would be documented on a weekly basis through written reports. The Complainant had indicated his concern that his experience with the previous trainers would be held against him, but Cst. McDonald assured him that they would be making a fresh start together. Aside from having reviewed the Complainant's file, including the previous Assessment Reports, Cst. McDonald did not know anything about the Complainant, and was only casually acquainted with one of the Complainant's previous coaches, Cst. Carr. Cst. McDonald wrote in a follow-up memo that he was confident that this would work in the Complainant's favour, as there would not exist any bias for or against him.\n[110] Cst. McDonald testified that the Complainant's mood at this meeting was energetic and that he demonstrated an eagerness to get on with the training. They went out on patrol together after the meeting and got along well, with a lot of laughter. The Complainant spoke of how hard Cst. Haney had been on him, and in contrast, how good a trainer Cst. Carr had been. The Complainant's attitude in the first two weeks was positive and well-motivated. Cst. McDonald described the calls that were handled over these blocks of work shifts as routine, but noted nonetheless that the Complainant had performed well. He appeared to be handling the stress of the job despite the obvious pressure he was working under.\n[111] The Complainant confirmed in his evidence that he was pleased with his first two weeks of training under the tutorship of Cst. McDonald. His report-writing was no longer being criticized nor were his activities being clocked. He still felt stressed about the situation, particularly since the coach tended to document the slightest errors in his performance, even in areas where he had already been deemed competent. He nevertheless viewed Cst. McDonald's first two weekly assessments as positive overall, and felt hopeful. For his part, Cst. McDonald was also feeling cautiously optimistic at this point, although he believed it was still too early to draw any final conclusions. The following week would prove to be an entirely different story.\nI. Second Extension of Field Training - Week 3 [112] On November 6, 1997, the Complainant and Cst. McDonald were dispatched to an apartment block where a man had allegedly uttered death threats. Cst. St-Fleur, who was also a recruit at the time, and his trainer, Cst. Marx, were also on patrol in the area, and were first to arrive on the scene. They had spoken to the victim by the time the others arrived. Cst. Marx suggested this incident would provide a good opportunity for both trainers to assess their trainees by letting them handle the inquiries and arrest if needed. By now, Cpl. Johnson, their supervisor, had also shown up. He was interested in observing how the Complainant would perform.\n[113] Before allowing the recruits to proceed, Cst. McDonald pointed out that the Complainant would be in charge of the call because it had originally been dispatched to him. The Complainant understood this to mean that he had the authority to give orders to the other officers on the scene. He informed them of his plan for the operation. Based on the information already collected, there appeared to be grounds for an arrest. The Complainant instructed Cst. St-Fleur to get a statement from the victim. In the meantime, the Complainant would arrest the suspect, with the assistance of either Cst. McDonald or Cst. Marx.\n[114] According to the Complainant, his plan was inexplicably rejected by the senior officers present. He was told that he could not assign Cst. St-Fleur to take the statement nor to arrest the suspect. The Complainant found this confusing as he understood that they were to work the file together. He therefore inquired of the trainers why they were refusing his approach. This discussion escalated into an argument. He claims that Cst. McDonald flew into a rage, grasped the Complainant's arm and pointed a finger to his chest. He yelled to the Complainant that he was only a recruit and he should do exactly as he was told. Cst. Marx and Cst. St-Fleur then left, and the Complainant completed the file on his own.\n[115] Cst. Marx, Cst. McDonald and Cpl. Johnston recorded their initial observations about this incident in three separate 1004 Performance Logs. Their recollections differ from the Complainant's. They claim that it was made clear from the outset that the Complainant would be in charge of the file. Cst. McDonald testified that the direction was typical of what the Complainant would have received in his training to date. It meant that he would be responsible for the entirety of the investigation including all paperwork and follow-up enquiries. The only difference here was that Cst. St-Fleur was assigned to assist him if needed. Cst. Marx referred to Cst. St-Fleur's role as a back-up to the Complainant. All four of the other officers, including Cst. St-Fleur, testified that they were surprised to see the Complainant begin to give orders, particularly to two senior officers, when he had been specifically told to handle the file himself and that the three senior members would observe.\n[116] Moreover, when the Complainant was called back and told specifically how they wanted him to conduct the investigation, he became argumentative and refused to listen. Cpl. Johnson described his attitude as defensive, stubborn and arrogant. To make things worse, the Complainant adopted this tone while in the main entranceway of the apartment building. Several members of the public were watching. Cst. Marx noted that the Complainant appeared to lack the ability to understand what the others were trying to convey to him and make a decision. He was unable to follow a simple direction in a basic file. Cst. McDonald described the Complainant's conduct as unacceptable and unprofessional. He was particularly concerned by the fact that the Complainant's previous trainers had previously documented and addressed with him this type of behaviour. Cst. St-Fleur did not write a report at the time but testified that he had no idea why his fellow recruit was unable to understand the instructions being given. To him, the directions were clear. Cst. St-Fleur testified that he even tried to restate and clarify the instructions in French at one point, but the Complainant refused to listen.\n[117] The incident caused Cpl. Johnson to have serious reservations about the Complainant's competence. The Complainant appeared to him to be at a loss as to what action to take, and even when given directions, he chose not to follow. Cpl. Johnson described the Complainant's performance in this matter as substandard and indicated that his lack of judgment and decision-making skills were of grave concern. Cpl. Johnson found the performance so disturbing that he had no confidence in the Complainant's ability to get the job done without someone standing over his shoulder. Cpl. Johnson concluded, in his Performance Log, that if the Complainant's substandard work continued, it would be questionable whether his employment with the RCMP would continue.\n[118] The Complainant was presented with copies of the negative Performance Logs at the time. He expressed outrage during his testimony that these senior RCMP members opted to make three distinct negative reports about this one incident, an excessive over-reaction in his opinion. Indeed, of the numerous persons acquainted with the RCMP in one way or another who testified at the hearing, most did not recall ever having witnessed a member receive three negative 1004 Performance Logs in respect of one incident. The Complainant feels that one negative report would have been sufficient. He submits that three reports were drafted in order to [TRANSLATION] crush him psychologically.\n[119] All three of the senior officers testified that they each independently decided to prepare a negative 1004 Performance Log about the incident. They did not consult with one another before or during the preparation of their reports. Cst. McDonald claims that considering the presence of three relatively senior officers observing a junior member's conduct in a training context, and the severity of the incident, it would be common for each of them to have wanted to record their observations in writing. He denies having raised his voice or jabbed his finger into the Complainant's chest.\n[120] The Complainant later apologized to the three members for his behaviour, but he testified that his only motivation for doing so was to preserve a good rapport with his trainer and supervisor. He maintains that he was not wrong but that the problem developed on account of miscommunication.\n[121] The Complainant received another negative 1004 Performance Log before the close of that week. It related to a series of events that commenced on November 5, 1997, the day before the death threats incident referred to above. The Complainant had recovered a pick-up truck that had been stolen from an airport parking lot. Numerous gardening tools were found in the vehicle, including a lawnmower, generators and power equipment. The owner of the tools was unknown. On the instructions of Cst. McDonald, the Complainant prepared an advisory of the recovered goods to be distributed through a national police bank, known as CPIC. Because of the national scope of such notices, a supervisor had to sign off on its issuance. The Complainant presented it for approval to Cpl. Wesley Waters, who was the road supervisor for the next shift. The Complainant also asked Cpl. Waters to place the notice on the briefing board, which in effect meant that all the incoming officers reporting for duty would be told to keep an eye out for any information regarding a theft of these goods.\n[122] Cpl. Waters looked at the list of items recovered and saw that many of them were manufactured by Honda. In his experience, the manufacturer kept track of the owners of this type of equipment through serial numbers and could easily provide the Complainant with this information. It was therefore not necessary to issue an advisory or a briefing board report in order to find out who the owner of the stolen goods was. Cpl. Waters looked up Honda Canada's number in the telephone book and gave it to the Complainant, advising him to call the company the following day. However, instead of placing the call, the Complainant went to another supervisor and asked him to brief the other teams, ignoring Cpl. Waters' previous instructions.\n[123] On November 11, 1997, Cpl. Waters ran into the Complainant, who had come into the detachment while on his day off. He asked the recruit how he had made out with his call to Honda. The Complainant responded that he had not managed to call them yet, with the explanation that he was in court all day on November 6th. In point of fact, he was not. The Complainant informed Cpl. Waters that he had in any event sent out the CPIC nation-wide advisory about the goods. Cpl. Waters was upset with the Complainant, reiterating to him that all he needed to have done was call Honda. Cpl. Waters was particularly concerned that the victim of the theft, who was likely a landscaper, was without the use of his tools for so many days and was probably losing revenue on account of the delay. The following day, Cpl. Waters called the Honda customer service department himself. Within a couple of minutes, he had the name and address of the owner.\n[124] Cpl. Waters criticized the Complainant in a 1004 Performance Log for having chosen to ignore the advice of a senior and more experienced investigator, thereby causing a costly delay in the return of the goods and an unnecessary investigation (ie. the CPIC national advisory).\n[125] For his part, the Complainant claims that when he first approached Cpl. Waters, it was primarily to have him check his exhibit report for spelling mistakes. Besides, contends the Complainant, there was nothing wrong in his asking the other road supervisor to brief the next shift about the recovered goods, it was a common practice. On the following day, November 6th, he responded to the death threats call, during which the dispute between him and the other senior officers developed. These circumstances prevented him from contacting Honda. The next day, November 7th, which was a Friday, he was on a night shift and the manufacturer's offices were closed when he tried to place a call in the evening. He was off-shift thereafter but came in to the station on his third day off, the 11th, with the intention of calling Honda.\n[126] It is worth noting, however, that the November 6th death threats call came in at the end of that day's shift, after 5 PM. The Respondent contends that the Complainant had ample opportunity to contact Honda earlier that day but deliberately chose not to comply with Cpl. Waters' instructions.\n[127] The Complainant points out that in the end, the property was returned to the owner on November 13th, barely more than a week after its theft. He argues that this is very quick compared to the months that it ordinarily takes to get stolen goods to their rightful owners. He also notes that the landscaper was so pleased to learn that his tools had been recovered that he offered a gift to the Complainant in gratitude. Cpl. Waters sees no relevance in this latter point, since the owner was simply not aware that he could have had his property returned to him even quicker, had the Complainant followed his original instructions.\n[128] In his summary of that week's activities, Cst. McDonald stated that the Complainant's RFT had been less than positive. He acknowledged that the trainee was under a lot of pressure, which undoubtedly caused him some anxiety. Cst. McDonald added that he did not wish to only dwell on the negatives, so he cited a couple of incidents where the Complainant had acted appropriately and performed very well.\nJ. Second Extension of Field Training - Week 4 [129] The next block of work shifts ran from November 13-19, 1997. Cst. McDonald referred to the week as uneventful, with fairly routine calls involving minimal investigation or follow-up. Yet Cst. McDonald documented three incidents in which the Complainant was said to have displayed poor decision-making skills.\n[130] The first related to a call that was minor in nature. Someone had reported seeing two men leaving an apartment with a television and loading it into a car. The Complainant drove to the scene and unwisely parked in the middle of a bus stop when there were plenty of other parking spaces available. Cst. McDonald had to remind the Complainant to park elsewhere. Then, a few moments later, someone was seen leaving the apartment. The Complainant approached him and asked if he lived there. The individual said no and the Complainant was about to let him drive away in his car. Cst. McDonald intervened and reminded the Complainant to get the person's identity and a better explanation for why he was there.\n[131] After obtaining this information from the man, the Complainant prepared to get back in his patrol car and leave the scene. Cst. McDonald had to step in once again and ask him what remained to be done. The Complainant seemed at a loss, so the coach had to specifically prompt him to locate and speak to the actual occupants of the apartment. This was eventually done and it was determined that they were simply in the process of moving out of their apartment. Cst. McDonald's criticism rested in the Complainant's lack of common sense in conducting this most basic of police work. The instructions given should not have been necessary.\n[132] The second documented negative incident of this week related to an arrest warrant against a young offender that the Complainant and Cst. McDonald executed in Vancouver. The trainer noted that this constituted basic police work, yet he had to prompt the Complainant to notify the Vancouver police force of their activity within that city's limits, and to alert their own dispatcher back in Burnaby once they had arrived. The latter procedure is referred to as a timer and is used in situations that pose some risk. If the dispatcher does not hear news from the officers within a designated period, a call will come in on the radio asking them if they are alright.\n[133] Once they arrived at the young offender's residence, the Complainant arrested the 14-year-old, but Cst. McDonald had to remind him to inform the youth's mother of what was happening. Cst. McDonald noted in his report that these are common sense steps that form part of standard operating procedure and they should be taken without thought by a member with twelve months' service.\n[134] In his testimony, the Complainant expressed frustration at the criticism. The mother did not speak English so he had asked the young offender's 10-year-old sibling to explain the situation to her. Even the young offender confirmed that his mother understood. Cst. McDonald refused to accept the Complainant's explanation that he had already given the information to the mother.\n[135] The final documented incident for the week concerned a call that came from a taxi driver complaining that a 14-year-old female customer had refused to pay her fare and threatened him with a knife. The Complainant and Cst. McDonald were dispatched as the primary vehicle to the scene but Cst. Marx, Cst. St-Fleur and Cpl. Johnson also responded. As primary responder, the Complainant was tasked with handling the file. He spoke to the driver for a couple of minutes about what had taken place. He then went to the young woman's residence, into which she had run after leaving the cab. Cst. McDonald claims that the Complainant immediately arrested her, brought her outside, handcuffed her and placed her in the back of his police vehicle.\n[136] Cst. McDonald decided to constructively challenge the Complainant about the decision that he had just made. He was particularly concerned that the recruit had acted after only having heard one side of the story. He asked the Complainant if he had obtained the young woman's version of the facts before arresting her. The Complainant replied that he had not, so he returned to the car and spoke to her to confirm whether an offence had occurred. It turned out her version differed from the driver's. She had told the cabbie she was going into her house to make arrangements to repay the taxi company, since she had no money with her. He did not want her to leave without paying so he chased her to the house and began shouting and banging on the door. She was frightened and grabbed a kitchen knife, which she displayed through the window to scare him away. As Cst. St-Fleur recounted in his testimony, she had no intention of hurting the driver. She just wanted him to leave. She showed him the knife through the window to deter him and defend herself.\n[137] The Complainant then returned to Cst. McDonald and relayed the young woman's version of the events. Cst. McDonald challenged him again as to what decision he should make now. The Complainant did not respond, so Cpl. Johnson stepped in to ask him again what his decision would be. Cst. McDonald testified that the Complainant appeared to be unsure. It was only once the others suggested to him that the cabbie had not been forthcoming with all of the facts and that no offence had actually occurred, that the Complainant responded by releasing the teenager from custody. Cst. McDonald testified that this decision was ultimately the right course of action to follow, but his concern was that the Complainant was unable to make it on his own, without any prompting or constructive challenges. Cst. McDonald is not persuaded that the Complainant would have made the right choice had he been on his own.\n[138] The Complainant, on the other hand, disputes Cst. McDonald's presentation of the events. In their initial conversation, the driver told the Complainant that the female suspect had placed a knife against his throat and threatened him. The Complainant felt he had enough information to proceed with an arrest. He spoke to the suspect and determined she was lying. He then arrested her for observation and so as to investigate.\n[139] While he was dealing with the teenager, the other officers had the benefit of speaking to the cabbie and realizing that he had misrepresented some of the facts. Thus, they had information that the Complainant lacked and were in a better position to know that an arrest was not warranted. The Complainant claims that when he rejoined the other officers outside, he was neither prompted nor constructively challenged. Instead, they encircled and aggressively confronted him. They did not share their newfound information, but deliberately chose to [TRANSLATION] play with him and force him to try to defend his decision. He was made to feel like an [TRANSLATION] imbecile. The questioning was not in a polite tone. He was yelled at, particularly by Cpl. Johnson, who bellowed that they were all waiting right now! for the Complainant to decide and tell them what he planned on doing. The Complainant claims that in the end the case only resolved itself after he exercised his negotiation skills to convince the driver to not file charges.\n[140] Cst. McDonald and Cpl. Johnson deny having raised their voices and insist that they were merely assessing the Complainant's decision-making ability.\nK. Second Extension of Field Training - Weeks 5 & 6 [141] The next block of work shifts began on November 21, 1997. Cst. McDonald worked with the Complainant for the first two days of this period only. The report for this block noted that the calls were fairly routine and the shifts relatively uneventful. Nonetheless, Cst. McDonald mentioned two specific incidents where the Complainant performed well. In one case, he helped process the arrest of a suspect. During these procedures, he established a good rapport with the detainee. This raised the possibility of his becoming a future informant for the police. In another case, the Complainant and Cst. McDonald were dispatched to a call regarding a break-and-entry theft. The Complainant headed off in the last known direction of the suspect. He soon located and apprehended him. The suspect was a career criminal and Cst. McDonald commended the Complainant for insuring that he would remain off the streets for some time. Cst. McDonald concluded the report with a statement that the Complainant found very encouraging: This week was more positive for Cst. Morin and hopefully it will become the norm rather than the exception.\n[142] For the next several days, the Complainant was tasked by the detachment to provide security at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, held in the Vancouver area. Heads of state and other dignitaries from around the world were in attendance, so security was a vital concern. The Complainant was assigned to work mainly at the final security checkpoint leading into the Simon Fraser University site where some of the meetings were being held. All persons attending this site had to pass through his checkpoint, after having already cleared several others in advance. His task consisted of stopping vehicles, viewing the security passes of the passengers, and relaying their information to the command post by radio. Once their credentials were verified and approved, he would allow the vehicle to enter the grounds.\n[143] The Complainant testified that his role was vital to the security of the area. There was a large risk involved and a potential for danger. If a vehicle tried to break through the barricade without permission, the Complainant would have to act instinctively and make a quick decision. This could even entail the use of his firearm. The Complainant perceived this assignment as reflecting a positive assessment of his decision-making skills and an endorsement of his abilities as a police officer. Why would he be assigned to a position of such responsibility if he was not yet competent?\n[144] The reply, according to the RCMP, is that the Complainant's assumption is mistaken. There was not as much responsibility attached to this posting as he suggests. This was the last of several checkpoints and it would have been highly unlikely for any unauthorized person to have made it that far. Furthermore, there was minimal decision-making involved with the actual functions of the posting. The decision on whether to admit or refuse someone was made at the command post, not by the Complainant. Traffic control and low-end security functions are usually assigned to members with less service.\n[145] Insp. Schlecker testified that when headquarters ordered him to provide a certain number of police officers to work at the APEC Summit, he deliberately sent the weakest members of his detachment, unless officers with specific expertise were being requested. Burnaby was a busy detachment that was already understaffed and he needed to maintain as much competency there as he could. He could not afford to give up his best personnel for basically card and post-viewing duties. Based on the reports he had been receiving, Insp. Schlecker had by then developed some concerns about the Complainant's policing skills, even questioning whether he was a danger to himself and others. But this did not prevent him from assigning the Complainant to the static checkpoint job at the Summit. Areas with a serious potential for volatility were staffed by special groups, such as riot squads and SWAT teams.\n[146] There is no indication in the evidence that any of the more senior RCMP members who testified or whose names were otherwise brought up, were assigned to work at the APEC Summit. Only three individuals from the detachment were mentioned in the evidence as having participated: Cst. Louis Ma, who had just completed his RFT that year and shared duties with the Complainant at the same checkpoint; Cst. St-Fleur, who was doing his RFT at the time and was assigned to open car doors for dignitaries; and the Complainant.\n[147] While the Complainant was away working at the APEC Summit, during the 5th and 6th weeks of the second extension of his training, Cst. McDonald testified that he began to reflect on how the RFT was progressing and whether the Complainant would ultimately be successful. He concluded that certain problems relating to the Complainant's decision-making skills were unlikely to be corrected within the remaining weeks of the extension period. Cst. McDonald cited as specific problems, the Complainant's tendency to rush to judgment without adequate information, his disregard for the advice of others, his unwillingness to accept responsibility for poor decisions, and his lack of common sense. The Complainant had told Cst. McDonald that if he did not succeed, he intended to move back to Quebec and seek employment with another police agency. Cst. McDonald knew that if the RFT was to run its course and the Complainant was still lacking in one of the criteria, he would be dismissed from the RCMP. This would stigmatize him and create an obstacle to his seeking future police-related employment. In addition, if the dismissal came at the end of the two month period, it would unfortunately fall right before Christmas.\n[148] Cst. McDonald claims that out of a sense of compassion, he approached Cpl. Johnson and Sgt. Ross and suggested that the Complainant be offered the immediate opportunity to resign. This would afford him the opportunity to gather his effects and organize his return to Montreal before Christmas as well as ensure that his record would merely show that he had served with the RCMP for a year and then resigned to seek employment elsewhere. There would be no indication that he had been dismissed. Cpl. Johnson welcomed the suggestion, but needed approval from senior management in order to implement it. Insp. Schlecker gave his approval a short time later.\n[149] Consequently, on the morning of November 30, 1997, at the start of the Complainant's first shift after returning from the APEC Summit assignment, Cst. McDonald and Cpl. Johnson invited the Complainant to breakfast at a local restaurant. Cst. McDonald testified that it was a cordial conversation, during which he pointed out the Complainant's positive attributes as well as the areas of concern. He explained his opinion that the Complainant would not be able to correct the problems in the remaining weeks of the RFT extension. Therefore, he gave the Complainant the option of resigning immediately. Cst. McDonald claims he made it clear that he would still be willing to offer the balance of the full two months of training if the Complainant so desired.\n[150] The Complainant was shocked by the proposition being put to him. He felt that he was coming off two very positive weeks. He had been encouraged by his last Performance Log, in which Cst. McDonald expressed hope that his positive performance would become the norm. This was hardly suggestive of a premature dismissal. His assignment to the APEC Summit had given him further cause for optimism.\n[151] After the breakfast meeting, they all went back to the detachment and the Complainant took some time to ponder his decision. Within an hour, the Complainant informed Cst. McDonald that he would exercise the option of resigning from the RCMP. Later that day, they met to discuss Cst. McDonald's final Assessment Report, which reiterated that the Complainant remained in need of improvement with respect to the single criterion of decision-making. The coach attached a three-page narrative to the Report. He listed four ways in which this deficiency manifested itself: the Complainant's tendency to rush to judgment and decisions without adequate information; his disregard for the advice and instruction of senior investigators; his unwillingness to accept responsibility for poor decisions; and his absence of common sense. Cst. McDonald provided details about some of the incidents that had been mentioned in his weekly Performance Logs, as illustrations of the problems experienced, including the November 6th death threats call, the arrest of the teenage girl who had not paid her taxi fare, and the case of the recovered stolen Honda machinery.\n[152] The following day, Insp. Schlecker met with the Complainant and requested his handgun and badge. They discussed some of the incidents referred to in Cst. McDonald's report. The Complainant claims that he tried again to provide his version of the events but Insp. Schlecker refused to hear it. The decision was already made. Insp. Schlecker explained that as a youngster, he wanted to learn to play the violin but realized that he just lacked the talent for it. In the same way, the Complainant was simply not cut out to be an RCMP officer. The Complainant left the meeting a broken person, his dream having gone to pieces. That evening, several colleagues from work came over to his home. It was very emotional for everyone.\n[153] The Complainant prepared and submitted to the detachment his own comments that day with respect to the final Assessment Report. He stated that he was very proud to have had the opportunity to receive the best police training in Canada. He thanked all his co-workers, supervisors and superiors for all their support. He did not regret his journey as a Mountie and working with the best. He expressed confidence that it would provide him various openings back home in Montreal.\n[154] Nevertheless, at the hearing, the Complainant underlined his dissatisfaction with the final Report. Yet again, none of the examples of commendable performance by him during this period were documented in the final Report, even though those incidents had been identified in the weekly Performance Logs. Furthermore, he alleges that he was subjected to differential treatment by his coach and other senior officers throughout this period, including the aggressive confrontation that he endured at the November 6th death threats call, not to mention the subsequent issuance of not one but three negative Performance Logs. He feels that he was also treated unfairly when he was encircled by the other officers during the unpaid taxi fare incident. Most importantly, the Complainant accuses Cst. McDonald of having exhibited conduct that demonstrated a racial prejudice against him and other black persons. Three specific examples were given.\n[155] The first relates to a sketch that Cst. McDonald allegedly drew one day while at the wheel of their parked patrol car. Cst. St-Fleur and his trainer, Cst. Marx, were seated in an adjacent vehicle. The Complainant claims that Cst. McDonald pulled out a sheet of paper and drew a picture of Cst. St-Fleur, who is also a black man of Haitian origin. The size of his nose and lips was exaggerated in the drawing. Cst. McDonald then stated with a laugh that the Complainant's nose and lips were smaller than those of Cst. St-Fleur. The Complainant did not openly react to this incident, nor did he inform Cst. St-Fleur about it, but he testified that inwardly he felt it was a [TRANSLATION] stupid and racist act.\n[156] Cst. McDonald categorically denies that this incident ever took place. The Complainant made no mention of the drawing in his human rights complaint. He never told or complained to anyone at the RCMP about it. The reference to a sketch first appeared in the Complainant's disclosure documents, namely the statement of the material facts of his case, which was filed with the Tribunal in February 2003. Curiously, according to the statement, the Complainant witnessed the drawing of a racist sketch in the fall of 1996, not 1997, the artist was Cst. Haney, and the person being drawn was Cst. Albert. The Complainant testified that he had told the Commission about the drawing when he filed the complaint. He added that shortly before the hearing, he had a flash, and came to the realization that it was Cst. McDonald, not Cst. Haney, who had drawn a picture of Cst. St-Fleur, not Cst. Albert. He completed his testimony on this point by repeating that it was Cst. McDonald who was the artist and that he [TRANSLATION] did not want to add anything else about Cst. Haney, it's enough.\n[157] The second example of racial discrimination given by the Complainant allegedly took place in a fast food restaurant where he, Cst. McDonald and several other officers had stopped during their shifts to have a coffee. Cst. St-Fleur mentioned to Cst. McDonald that his tie was dirty, to which the latter responded, Who looks more dirtier between you and me? The Complainant recalls that Cst. St-Fleur's boots were shined up, his shirt was well-pressed, and he was neatly dressed overall. Indeed, Cst. St-Fleur had a reputation for being a very tidy dresser and in his Field Coaching Assessment Reports, under the criterion of Dress and Deportment, he had received a superior score. The Complainant could only conclude that Cst. McDonald's remark was a reference to Cst. St-Fleur's skin colour. The statement was made in the presence of Cpl. Johnson who did not react in any way. The Complainant viewed this incident as degrading and humiliating, a direct form of racism. This event was not mentioned in the Complainant's human rights complaint, either.\n[158] Cst. McDonald denied ever making the comment. Cst. St-Fleur on the other hand testified to having a vague recollection of it. He recalls that his bullet-proof vest was very dirty that day. He viewed Cst. McDonald's remarks as referring to his vest, as if to say, whose uniform is dirtier, yours or mine? Cst. St-Fleur looked down at his jacket and realized that Cst. McDonald's comments were justified. Cst. St-Fleur testified that he was surprised when the Complainant later approached him with a shocked look and complained about the remark. Cst. St-Fleur asked him what the big deal was. Cst. St-Fleur suspects that the Complainant was simply not aware of the context of the conversation. It was a reasonable misunderstanding on his part, but a misunderstanding nonetheless.\n[159] The third incident where the Complainant claims that Cst. McDonald demonstrated insensitivity to persons of colour relates to a discussion that occurred between the two of them and Cst. St-Fleur regarding the RCMP's employment equity program. The coach asserted that black persons and members of other designated groups were being hired by preference over white males. He took the position that this in itself constituted reverse discrimination. The Complainant and Cst. St-Fleur replied that these measures were necessary to correct the under-representation of these groups within the RCMP. The Complainant acknowledges that this exchange was conducted in a professional tone, but he perceives Cst. McDonald's beliefs as evidence that he did not comprehend the extent of the problems facing black persons in the RCMP. The Complainant claims it was hurtful to have to witness this lack of understanding.\n[160] Cst. McDonald recalled the conversation in his testimony. It related to the initial testing administered to persons applying to join the RCMP. The point score required to advance to the next level of assessment was higher for white males than it was for members of the designated groups. Their discussion turned on whether this was fair, inasmuch as the testing was one-dimensional and persons who would otherwise make competent police officers could end up being screened out. Cst. McDonald claims that he himself pointed out during the conversation that certain groups have historically been under-represented within the RCMP. He alleges that all three of them laughed at the fact that he had to score higher than the other two, but he maintains that he never expressed a negative opinion about that, other than to say that he hoped that the most qualified persons were ultimately selected. According to Cst. McDonald, it was a constructive conversation.\n[161] The Complainant further contends that Insp. Schlecker, the officer in charge of operations, made statements about visible minorities that were offensive and inappropriate. In December 1998, he was asked by the RCMP to provide his comments regarding the Complainant's present human rights complaint, which alleged differential treatment on account of his colour. Insp. Schlecker drafted a memo in which he stated that up until the Commission's investigation into the complaint, he did not know that Cst. Morin was coloured, and added that the Complainant is of darker complexion, as I, and I believed also from European extraction. Asked at the hearing to comment about these remarks, Inspector Schlecker said, Until I was advised that he considered himself black, I really never thought that Constable Morin was black. He further testified that:\nHe [the Complainant] reminds me of a close friend of mine by the name of [...], who is a Hungarian. He could almost be his twin brother. When I look at Constable Morin I never think of him as being a black man. He [the Complainant] tells me he has black heritage. I believe that and then when I look at him I could say, yes, I could see some of that in you. But without being told that, it is not evident to me.\n[162] The Complainant points out that several RCMP documents, including the form that was sent to Burnaby from Depot advising of the Complainant's impending arrival for training, clearly specified that he was a black man of Haitian origin.\n[163] In his memo, Insp. Schlecker also declared that the Burnaby detachment had a much higher than norm ratios [sic] of coloured, race and gender mix because of the high turnover of recruits and managements [sic] desire to mirror the community of Burnaby. Asked at the hearing about his use of the word coloured, he explained that in 1972, he had asked a friend in Saskatchewan who was black, What should we say you are? The friend replied, Well, say I'm coloured. So, when Insp. Schlecker used the term in his memo, he did not think it offensive. The Complainant contends that to the contrary, it is offensive and derogatory, as it relates back to the periods of slavery and segregation in the Old South of the United States. The Complainant points out that there is an important distinction to be drawn between the word used by Insp. Schlecker, and the phrase persons of colour, which is being used increasingly these days, in lieu of the term members of a visible minority group.\n[164] In reference to the remark in the memo regarding Burnaby's population, Insp. Schlecker was asked at the hearing to describe the make-up of the city. He noted that what we consider as the average white European Canadian is in certain areas of the community becoming almost a minority in the lower mainland [of British Columbia] (my emphasis).\nL. Return to Montreal [165] Following his resignation from the RCMP, the Complainant and his fianc\u00e9e, Ms. Cerrato, immediately began preparing for their return to Montreal. They arranged for movers, packed boxes, terminated their lease, and notified utility companies. Throughout this period, the Complainant was not contacted by any senior officer at the detachment to see how he was doing, nor was any logistical assistance offered. A sum of $1,500 was made available to the Complainant to cover some of his expenses for his return home, and he received his salary as a Member until mid-January 1998. Even so, he had no choice but to use up all his savings and incur credit card debt to pay his expenses. In order to minimize his costs, he opted to leave some of his furniture and other property in Burnaby, rather than pay for their transport to Quebec.\n[166] The couple returned home to Montreal by car, a six day trek during which they passed through some bad weather, almost had an accident, and had to repair their vehicle after a breakdown. It was an ordeal. The Complainant was depressed throughout the trip.\n[167] Upon his return to Montreal, the Complainant sought employment with several police forces in Quebec. He applied to the municipal force of the City of Laval, but was informed that he needed a college or university level degree in a policing-related field in order to be screened in. He also made an application to the Suret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. He passed the physical and driving tests, but failed the interview for reasons that were never conveyed to him. He handed in an application to the Brossard municipal police department but never heard any news back. After applying to the police service of the city of \u00cele-Perrot, he was invited to write an exam. He failed the test, due to his lack of familiarity with Quebec provincial statutes.\n[168] On December 22, 1997, the Complainant applied to join the Montreal Urban Community Police Service (MUCPS) as a police officer. In his application, he explained that the reason he decided to leave the RCMP was his desire to work in his native province, to live close to his family, and to work in English and French. No mention was made of his having been expressly or constructively dismissed. The MUCPS had established an employment equity program to encourage the recruitment of employees from designated groups. In accordance with the program, the Complainant filled out a questionnaire in which he identified himself as a visible minority.\n[169] After passing his physical test, the Complainant was invited to an interview conducted by a two-member panel. One of the interviewers was Suzanne Lachance. She testified that the interview lasted for about 1.5 hours. Questions were asked of him to assess his maturity, interpersonal abilities, assertiveness, and tolerance to stress. In addition, the panel assessed his responses to three different policing scenarios that were presented to him. These answers were used to measure his analytical and decision-making abilities. After the interview, the panel assessed him with an overall score of 54.82%. A result of 60% or higher was required to recommend him for further consideration for the position of police officer.\n[170] The panel prepared a report following the interview. The Complainant had only scored 47\/90 with respect to the scenarios put to him. It was noted that he had demonstrated some [TRANSLATION] rigidity in dealing with all three cases. He applied laws and regulations [TRANSLATION] by the book and he was not very [TRANSLATION] open to his decisions being called into question. With respect to one of the situational cases presented to him, the panellists were concerned that in his answer, he chose to ignore the advice of a fellow police officer. In another case, the panel was critical of his decision to arrest some young offenders too quickly, without thinking of the consequences. The interviewers detected some impatience in the manner in which he answered all of these questions. Ms. Lachance remarked that he needed to adopt a more tolerant attitude and better acquaint himself with the use of discretion.\n[171] The panel surmised that the Complainant was still strongly influenced by his exposure to the [TRANSLATION] culture and values of the RCMP, which differed from those of the MUCPS. Ms. Lachance recalled that the Complainant discussed some of the difficulties he faced integrating into the RCMP, primarily as a francophone but also as a black person. He told the panel that he made considerable efforts to adapt. In the end, he opted to resign so as to be closer to his family. The Complainant never informed the panel of his expected failure to pass his RFT that had led to his resignation. Monique Cyr, who was in charge of the selection and performance evaluation process for police personnel of the Montreal Urban Community, explained that the Complaint's concealment of his impending failure might have been discovered later in the process, when an inquiry is done into an applicant's reputation. If such a lack of candour were uncovered at that stage, an unfavourable report would have been drafted regarding his reputation and his candidacy would have been terminated, in the absence of a justifiable explanation.\n[172] Although the Complainant's score did not meet the standard for police officers, the MUCPS was also looking to hire auxiliary police officers at that time. Their jobs consisted principally of handling inmates who were detained in the MUCPS's facilities. They did not carry weapons. The threshold score for the position of auxiliary police officer had been set at 50%. Since the Complainant had achieved this level, and had previously indicated his interest in this auxiliary position as well, the interview panel decided to continue processing his candidacy, but solely for this job.\n[173] The Complainant's file was therefore advanced to the next stage. It consisted of a psychometric assessment of the candidate, in which his psychological traits were measured scientifically. All candidates had to undergo this testing. In the Complainant's case, it was conducted by Dr. Anne Genevi\u00e8ve Girard, PhD, an industrial psychologist and a member of Quebec's professional association of certified human resources and industrial relations consultants (l'Ordre des conseillers en ressources humaines et en relations industrielles agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec). Her mandate from the MUCPS was to determine whether an applicant suffered from any mental or behavioural disorder (psychopathology) and to provide a general overview of the applicant's personality traits. Prior to preparing her assessment of the Complainant, she had not been given any information relating to his first interview or the panel's findings, and was therefore unaware of its decision to consider the Complainant's candidacy for the auxiliary police officer position only. After interviewing and testing the Complainant, Dr. Girard found that the Complainant did not suffer from any disorder that called for an immediate termination of his candidacy. However, she also determined that he only partially satisfied the requirements for the position of police officer.\n[174] The Complainant's scores were assessed against the scores of all other MUCPS job applicants who had been tested in the past, about 600 persons. He was rated poor with respect to three of the assessment factors (responsibility, empathy, flexibility), which meant that his scores were lower than those of 85% of the group (ie. below the 15th percentile). Based on these results, Dr. Girard wrote in her report to the selection committee that the Complainant's sense of responsibility fell below the norm, that he lacked empathy towards others, and that he was inflexible. He tended to [TRANSLATION] firmly hold on to his ideas and not to be very sensitive to the opinions of others. In her recommendations, Dr. Girard stated that the Complainant could satisfy the requirements for the job of an MUCPS patrol officer, and suggested the examination of his candidacy continue. In her testimony, however, she elaborated that she had no mandate to exclude any of the candidates other than those who had exhibited mental or behavioural disorders. In all other cases her opinion was advisory and not binding on the selection committee.\n[175] After receiving Dr. Girard's report, the interview panel decided to reassess their own findings. The panel realized that the Complainant's rigidity was not so much rooted in the RCMP environment from which he had just returned, but was instead embedded in his personality. The panel decided therefore not to proceed any further with the Complainant's candidacy, even in regard to the auxiliary police officer position. A letter was sent to the Complainant, dated May 14, 1998, informing him that, pursuant to his psychometric assessment, it was determined that his candidacy did not correspond to the profile sought for the position of MUCPS officer.\n[176] The MUCPS was not the only prospective employer to administer psychometric testing to the Complainant. On April 9, 1998, he applied to Canadian National Railways (CN) for the position of police officer. In the application, he inscribed resignation as his reason for leaving his previous employment with the RCMP. The Complainant was tested by CN using the General Aptitude Test Battery, which measures some, but not all, of the basic skills required for a clerical position. The aptitudes assessed were intelligence, verbal aptitude, and numerical aptitude. CN set the pass rate at the 25th percentile, which means that 75% of the general population would score higher than this cut-off point. The Complainant placed between the 38th and the 45th percentiles with respect to the three aptitudes assessed by CN. He therefore passed the test, and was in fact offered a job by CN. He had been initially told that a position was available in Quebec, but he was only offered a posting in Toronto. He opted to decline.\n[177] The Complainant did not limit his job searches to policing. He searched through the classified ads for employment. In early 1998, he obtained work as a security guard in a seniors' home. He worked the midnight to noon shift at $10.00 per hour. For a few weeks around the Christmas shopping season of 1998, he was hired by a couple of department stores as a store detective. He worked several other part-time jobs. In 1999, he took a full-time position on contract as a security guard in a private college. Unfortunately, his job functions included emptying garbage cans. Compared to the duties and responsibilities he held as an RCMP officer, he found all of this work demeaning and embarrassing. But he had no choice. He was carrying a significant debt load. Bankruptcy was not an option as it would likely have barred him from any future employment in policing.\n[178] The Complainant sought to improve himself academically, so he registered for correspondence courses in drug addiction prevention given by the University of Montreal. He earned his certificate within two years. Thereafter, he took courses in police management from the same university.\n[179] In July 1999, the Complainant applied for a position with the agency operating Montreal's airports, A\u00e9roports de Montr\u00e9al (ADM), as an officer - dog-handler (patrouilleur - ma\u00eetre de chien). The role of these officers and their dogs is to search airplanes, packages, vehicles, or any other object in order to detect explosives. These functions had been performed by specialized RCMP officers until 2000, when the service was transferred directly to ADM. The Complainant's application was processed as part of ADM's initial recruitment to replace the departing RCMP officers.\n[180] In the job application forms, applicants were instructed to provide truthful information, failing which their applications could be refused. One of the questions asked on the form was whether the candidate had ever been dismissed or asked to resign from a previous position. The Complainant answered no. He explained later in the document that he had left his job at the RCMP because it was too far away from his home in Montreal, the rents were too high in B.C., and it was unlikely he would be transferred back to Quebec in the next 10 years.\n[181] He was asked to take a written exam, which was to be completed within a fixed span of time. In the first portion, the candidate had to complete incident reports in French regarding two video-taped scenarios that were shown to him. The second portion required that he answer two questions in English, one of which also consisted of a scenario. The assessors for this exam did not testify, but the Complainant's answer sheet, together with their comments, were entered into evidence. On one of the incident reports, the remark [TRANSLATION] unsatisfactory is inscribed. The other report is marked [TRANSLATION] satisfactory - borderline - chronology leaves something to be desired. With respect to the English answers, the scenario-based reply was marked [TRANSLATION] unsatisfactory and the other one [TRANSLATION] satisfactory.\n[182] The Complainant's application was advanced to the next stage, which consisted of an interview conducted in August 1999. He also underwent a physical test and some stringent field testing that extended over several days. In September 1999, ADM offered him the position on an indeterminate full-time basis. He has worked there to this day. He considers the job very rewarding. He responds whenever bomb threats are called or suspicious packages are found. He searches luggage and aircraft, and if his inquiries prove negative, he authorizes the flight crew to allow the passengers to board and to depart. His services were called upon extensively on September 11, 2001. With the assistance of the Suret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec and the RCMP, he inspected 21 airplanes that had been grounded following the hijackings in the U.S.\n[183] The Complainant contends that his success at this job demonstrates that he possesses the qualifications to be a police officer, particularly since his job used to be performed by RCMP officers. The Respondent disagrees, pointing out that the Complainant does not have the formal status of police officer, he does not have the power to arrest persons, he does not carry a firearm, and he does not conduct investigations.\nM. Official Languages Complaint [184] Prior to filing the present human rights complaint, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages (OCOL), on May 28, 1998. He alleged that although he satisfied the linguistic requirements for the job in Burnaby, he was dismissed because the senior officers at the detachment considered his English-language abilities to be insufficient. The OCOL staff member who received his complaint noted on the complaint form that the Complainant [TRANSLATION] is aware that his complaint does not relate to a question of discrimination.\n[185] On July 3, 1998, the Complainant, accompanied by his lawyer, attended the OCOL offices in Ottawa and gave a statement regarding his complaint. The notes that were apparently taken by the OCOL staff members who met with him were entered into evidence, but these individuals did not testify. The notes refer to most of the incidents that were raised in the present case. The Complainant reportedly stated that he was annoyed at being called OBO and Kirby Puckett Ass. There is no indication in the notes, however, that he considered these terms to be racist in nature. Indeed, the Complainant did not make any allegation of racism whatsoever before the OCOL.\n[186] A couple of months later, on September 9, 1998, the Complainant filed the present complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[187] In September 1999, the OCOL issued its final report after completing its investigation. It concluded that there was no evidence to support the Complainant's allegation that he lost his job due to an inadequate knowledge of English or that he was subjected to linguistic harassment.\nII. ANALYSIS A. The Section 7 Complaint [188] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 7 of the Act, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, during the course of his employment, on the basis of a prohibited ground, including his colour. It is also a discriminatory practice to dismiss an employee on this prohibited ground.\n[189] The initial burden of proof rests with the complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The basic guidance for what is required to make out a prima facie case was provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley). The Court stated that a prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory. If a reasonable explanation is given, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.); Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at paras. 17-18).\n[190] Discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7 (F.C.A.)). The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\n[191] As was pointed out in Basi, supra, at paragraph 38481, discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances in determining if there exists a subtle scent of discrimination. An inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inference or hypothesis (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, (Toronto: Carswell, 1987), at 142; see also Chopra v. Dept. of National Health and Welfare (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (CHRT)).\nB. Prima Facie Case [192] The Complainant submits that he was subjected to differential treatment throughout his RFT and that his colour was a factor in this differentiation. He also contends that his colour played a role in the decision to terminate his employment, or alternatively, that the mistreatment he experienced impacted on his performance, which ultimately resulted in his dismissal.\n[193] The Complainant argues that he was treated differentially while being trained by all three of his coaches. With respect to Cst. Haney, he cites the following treatment:\nTiming the Complainant's response times to the scene of a call; Timing his report-writing; Insisting that he re-write his reports; Denying him access to the office computers; Insisting that he change the format of his notebook; Refusing to mention positive or commendable acts in the Assessment Reports; Repeatedly yelling at him; Suggesting only weeks into his RFT that he was not suited to be a police officer and should consider quitting.\n[194] The Complainant contends that other trainees were not treated in this way. He believes that his colour was a factor in Cst. Haney's behaviour towards him, as illustrated by the following:\nAddressing the Complainant as OBO and Kirby Puckett Ass; Asking him and Cst. St-Fleur if they had shaken hands like black men do.\n[195] The Complainant contends that not only is the term OBO connected to slave-auctions, but that its usage by Cst. Haney referred back to the mistake that the Complainant had made on his first day at work. It was therefore suggestive of a lack of intelligence, which he argues is a negative racial stereotype ascribed to black persons.\n[196] Dr. Frances Henry, PhD, F.R.S.C., was called by the Complainant to testify as an expert on the basis of her broad and general expertise on notions of racism, racial discrimination and harassment in society at large and in the workplace, from a social sciences perspective. She gave evidence that the reference to Kirby Puckett, who is known for his large posterior, called attention to the well known physical characteristic of many people of African origin - their high rounded buttocks. She submitted that this was therefore an inappropriate nickname, particularly considering the asymmetrical relationship that existed between the coach and his trainee. There was little that the Complainant could do to challenge the use of such terminology other than quietly accept it.\n[197] The repeated timing of the Complainant's work implied that he was lazy and slow. Dr. Henry identified the possibility of stereotyping here as well, in that a powerful and very negative image of Blacks is that they are slow.\n[198] The Complainant submits that the differential treatment continued while he was under Cst. Carr's tutelage. This included the ongoing timing of his activities, the failure to mention praiseworthy conduct in the Assessment Reports, and the attempt to persuade him to quit the RCMP. The Complainant also believes that Cst. Carr was instrumental in Cst. Marx's decision to issue a second Performance Log in connection with the ride-along shift, to negate the positive message that had been conveyed about the Complainant in an earlier Performance Log.\n[199] It is argued that Cst. Carr's overall attitude towards the Complainant was not conducive to the development of a zone of comfort between them, which in turn had a chilling effect on the Complainant's willingness to ask questions and seek advice. Any lapses in his earlier training, attributable to the poor treatment received at the hands of Cst. Haney, were thus exacerbated. His performance naturally bore the cost.\n[200] The differential treatment continued into the second RFT extension period, under Cst. McDonald. The Complainant believes that the circumstances surrounding the December 6th, 1997, incident clearly illustrate that he was treated differently when compared to other RCMP recruits and members. Not only was he affronted and physically attacked by Cst. McDonald in the building hallway, but he was saddled thereafter with three negative 1004 Performance Logs, a never before seen practice, which virtually sealed his fate. This persecution, contends the Complainant, was repeated during the subsequent call involving the teenager who had not paid the taxi driver. The senior officers ridiculed him. Their actions were unjustified.\n[201] In addition, just as was the case with the other trainers, Cst. McDonald did not take into consideration some of the Complainant's better work. Indeed, the Complainant questions how the decision to dismiss him came about, in light of his sound performance during the last block of work shifts and at the APEC Summit. He believes that another factor must have been at play - discrimination on the basis of his colour.\n[202] Three incidents are specifically mentioned in support of this assertion:\nCst. McDonald's sketch, in which Cst. St-Fleur's physical features as a black man were exaggerated, and Cst. McDonald's subsequent comment comparing the respective features of Cst. St-Fleur and the Complainant; Cst. McDonald's remark that Cst. St-Fleur was dirtier than Cst. McDonnald's tie; and Cst. McDonald's disapproving comments about employment equity policies within the RCMP.\n[203] The Complainant also alluded to a sort of domino effect that may have developed from one RFT period to the next. He claims that the Assessment Reports of the initial RFT period were tainted due to Cst. Haney's discriminatory attitude. The negative perceptions of the Complainant were carried forward as these reports were successively read by the other trainers who were therefore influenced by Cst. Haney's discrimination. This influence extended informally to other members of the detachment. For instance, many of the witnesses who were working at the detachment at the time were aware that the Complainant's nickname was OBO, and even knew the circumstances regarding the used car ads which gave rise to its usage. The Complainant believes that in the same fashion, word about Cst. Haney's poor assessment of him must have reached the others at the detachment.\n[204] Although his RFT assessments were made by the three coaches who worked directly with the Complainant, he points out that the decision to constructively dismiss him ultimately rested with Insp. Schlecker. The record, it is argued, contains numerous offensive comments from Insp. Schlecker illustrating a prejudiced view of visible minorities, such as the use of the term coloured people and his comment about average white European Canadians.\n[205] Moreover, the Complainant submits that these remarks are indicative of a widespread prejudice against visible minorities that permeated throughout the Burnaby detachment. It was acknowledged by some of the witnesses that the term DWO, meaning driving while oriental, had been occasionally used at the time by at least a few officers. The use of this term and Insp. Schlecker's remarks indicate the presence of what Dr. Henry described as a discourse of we and they amongst the Burnaby detachment's personnel, where members of minority groups were perceived as outsiders.\n[206] In the end, the Complainant's case boils down to a simple point. He is a black man who, despite successfully completing his training at Depot, was told that he was not going to pass his RFT and would not be hired as a regular member. In effect, he was dismissed from the RCMP. According to the evidence, around the same time as the Complainant's RFT, the only individuals who required an extension in order to pass their RFT at the Burnaby detachment were two black men (Cst. St-Fleur and Cst. Knight). It would appear that a short time prior to the Complainant's RFT, a white female candidate did not pass her RFT. Furthermore, just like the Complainant, Cst. St-Fleur's first coach (Cst. Marx) told him part way through his RFT to consider changing his career. Cst. Marx also found that Cst. St-Fleur needed to improve his ability to define problems and his decision-making skills.\n[207] Taking all of the preceding elements into account, and applying the O'Malley test, I am satisfied that if these allegations are believed, they are complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. The prima facie case has been established.\nC. The RCMP's Explanation [208] According to the RCMP, the Complainant was dismissed because he was not qualified to be a regular member. There was no other factor at play. Police officers are entrusted with extraordinary powers for the execution of their duties. It is therefore essential that they be reliable, honest, and in possession of good judgment. This is a bona fide occupational requirement. It is during an officer's probationary period that a police force assesses these essential qualities in a recruit. If a new member does not demonstrate that he satisfies these requirements, then in the interest of public safety, his employment must be terminated.\n[209] The Respondent submits that the Complainant lacked the qualities and abilities needed to act with good judgment, on a regular and predictable basis. The evidence shows that under stress, he was unable to reason properly, and could not explain or justify the decisions that he made. He did not manage to demonstrate that he was able to reliably, on a regular basis, take all factors into account when formulating his decisions.\n[210] A probationary employee does not benefit from the same level of job security as a permanent employee. Employees on probation are meant to undergo a period of testing, demonstration or investigation of their qualifications and suitability for regular employment as permanent employees (Jacmain v. Attorney General (Canada), [1978] S.C.R. 15 at 38). Probationary employees may be terminated if, in the employer's judgment, they have failed to meet the standards set and are considered to be unsatisfactory.\n[211] In Daniels v. Hamilton-Wentworth (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board (No. 2) (1996), 31 C.H.R.R. D\/189 (Ont. Bd. Inq.), this principle was applied in a police hiring setting. The complainant alleged that he was treated unequally and was dismissed near the end of his probation as a police constable because of his race and colour. The Board found that his race was not a factor and noted, at paragraph 125, that it is within an employer's rights to release an employee who is not considered likely to meet the standards of performance required by the organization. Performance criticisms are legitimate factors to consider in assessing the suitability of retaining a probationary constable to become a member of a permanent police force.\n[212] In the present case, the Complainant was clearly in a probationary situation. He had to meet the required standards under the Field Coaching Program by the sixth month of his field assessment, in order to be recommended for entry into the RCMP as a regular member. If the Complainant did not meet the standards, it was legitimate to dismiss him, subject to the following qualification: the employer's decision could not be tainted by bad faith (see Jacmain, supra at 37), and it could likewise not be tainted by conduct that is proscribed under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[213] The assessment process utilized by the RCMP during the field training was largely subjective. Trainers evaluated recruits against certain criteria, but the evaluation standards and methods could conceivably vary from one coach to another. The Complainant submits, for instance, that Cst. Haney was particularly harsh in his methods and his assessments. But, as was pointed out in Folch v. Canadian Airlines International (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261 at para. 165 (C.H.R.T.), the fact that an employer uses subjective criteria in its evaluation of applicants does not in itself render its hiring decisions subject to attack under the Act. Where subjective criteria are used, it may be necessary to scrutinize the hiring decisions more carefully to insure that subjective assessments are not being used to mask discrimination. However, it is not the function of the Tribunal to determine whether it agrees with each of the hiring decisions made by the employer. Its function is to determine whether the complainant was discriminated against on the alleged grounds of discrimination.\n[214] Did the Complainant meet the RCMP's standards? The Respondent submits that he unquestionably failed to do so. This was meticulously documented by not one, but three separate coaches. Initially there were several concerns, but ultimately the common and key preoccupation for all the coaches were the Complainant's decision-making skills. They constituted one of the 28 specified criteria in which a recruit must demonstrate competence. The Field Coach Program Standard sets out 11 components of decision-making that a recruit must demonstrate to be successful. They include:\nmaking professional decisions that take into account community needs even under difficult and stressful situations;\nconsidering a range of alternative courses of action;\ntaking into account new information or advice and reconsidering decisions;\nclearly and concisely defending decisions made, and responding to questions or challenges that are raised.\n[215] The Respondent submits that the incidents referred to in all three coaches' Assessment Reports document that the Complainant lacked competence in each of these areas. For instance, all four of these components were absent in his handling of the call involving the teenager and the taxi driver that took place in the fourth week of his second extension, shortly before he resigned from the RCMP. The arrest of the girl was not in the community's interest and was implemented before he had considered an alternative course of action. He was unable to defend his decision when challenged by senior members, and when finally presented with new information (the girl's perspective on the incident), he had to be prompted to reconsider his decision.\n[216] Furthermore, in attempting to justify his errors and deflect criticism, he would deliberately mislead senior officers, as occurred in the incident involving Cpl. Waters where the Complainant falsely stated that he was at court all day on November 6, 1997. This demonstrates, it is argued, that he lacks the honesty expected of RCMP officers.\n[217] The three trainers were not alone in finding that the Complainant was lacking in his decision-making skills. Cst. Albert found that the Complainant was rushing to judgment and was not thinking things through, when he let the teenaged shoplifter return to the group home unescorted. Cst. Van Overbeek complained about the Complainant's decision to leave a suspect unattended at a crime scene. Cst. Akow questioned his decision to leave seized marijuana stored in his duty locker for a month. Cst. Merritt criticized the Complainant for concentrating his attention on a civil dispute instead of focussing on the criminal matter for which he had been called.\n[218] There is no evidence to support the Complainant's claim that these officers and the trainers who succeeded Cst. Haney were somehow influenced or tainted by the first trainer's alleged racial biases. Burnaby was, after all, a very large detachment and over the course of his RFT, the Complainant worked with several teams, during various work shift blocks and in three different districts. Cst. McDonald did not even know Cst. Haney, and had only a passing acquaintance with Cst. Carr.\n[219] The Complainant takes issue with most of the negative assessments ascribed to his performance. He contends that he was wrongly criticized, and that his versions and explanations of what transpired during the various incidents cited were not considered. In most of the cases, the Complainant feels that he took the appropriate action, or that his errors were inconsequential and did not warrant criticism. That may be, but in my view, we cannot lose sight of the fact that this is a probationary period during which the employer is subjectively assessing the qualifications of the candidate. The mere fact that the Complainant's performance was criticized by his trainers and other more senior members does not prove that he was being discriminated against. As spelled out in Folch, it is not the role of the Tribunal to second-guess an employer's assessment of an employee's performance, unless there is evidence that a discriminatory ground was a factor. I would add that it is also not the role of the Tribunal to second-guess the choice of training and assessment methods that an employer may utilize with respect to a particular individual (e.g. measuring his time to respond to a call or imposing a specific format for a notebook), provided once again that discrimination is not a factor in their implementation.\n[220] The Complainant submits that if one takes into consideration the circumstantial evidence surrounding his RFT at Burnaby, an inference can be drawn that the RCMP's explanation is just a pretext and that in fact, his colour was a factor. The Complainant's most oft-cited proof in support of this assertion was the fact that Cst. Haney gave him the nickname OBO, and that the term continued to be used by the coach and others at the detachment thereafter. I do not, however, accept the Complainant's contention that this term is in and of itself infused with racial overtones that hearken back to slave auctions in pre-emancipation America. No evidence from any reference source, be it dictionary, encyclopaedia, almanac, or text book, was introduced to support this assertion. To the contrary, the Complainant's own witness, Dr. Henry, who is an expert in racism and racial discrimination, testified that she had never before heard of the use of the terms OBO\/or best offer as racial epithets. It leaves one with the distinct impression that the meaning ascribed to the term was devised for the sole purpose of advancing this case. I am mindful that one of the Complainant's witnesses, Cst. Aubrey Bacchus, an RCMP officer who worked with him at Burnaby, testified that he was aware of the term's claimed connotation. However, he presented his evidence in a manner that was remarkably similar to that previously put forth by the Complainant. In light of the utter absence of any other independent source for this definition, Cst. Bacchus' testimony is cast into doubt. I am therefore not at all persuaded that the term bears in and of itself any racial connotation.\n[221] But what of the Complainant's subsidiary submission that the nickname is suggestive of a lack of intelligence, which is a racial stereotype? In this regard, I note that the Complainant was not the only person in the RCMP to have a nickname. Cpl. Cousins testified that one person who developed lice while at Depot was called Bugs for years thereafter. Cst. McDonald recalled that another recruit who apparently had misunderstood the meaning of the abbreviation L.N.U. in relation to a suspect (last name unknown), ended up being called by this phrase thereafter. Cst. Anthony Akow testified that he was known as Silent H because he pronounced his first name Antony. Cst. Haney testified that he was known as Dumbo, in reference to the shape of his ears, and Weenie Boy because he liked to eat hot dogs.\n[222] None of these terms are particularly flattering, nor arguably are they respectful of another's dignity. Cst. Haney and others confirmed that it is now increasingly frowned upon within the RCMP to address anyone by anything other than their proper names. This is a welcome development perhaps, but does it imply that the nicknames used in the past were discriminatory? In the case of the particular term OBO, none of the witnesses who called the Complainant by this nickname or who were aware of its existence, gave any indication that they associated it with a lack of intellect on the part of the Complainant. To the contrary, it was noted by several witnesses, including Cst. Haney, that the Complainant was considered by them to be an intelligent, not to mention amicable, person. Cst. Haney's explanation that the name was simply in keeping with the level of camaraderie that existed amongst members of the detachment is entirely consistent with the scene that appears in the home video. None of the witnesses testified ever having been asked by the Complainant to cease calling him by that name. In all of these circumstances, I am unconvinced that the use of this nickname by Cst. Haney suggests that his opinions about the Complainant's intellect were tainted by racial or discriminatory overtones.\n[223] The term Kirby Puckett Ass, with its reference to the famous African-American athlete, might have appeared more obviously linked to the Complainant's colour, especially given the Complainant's somewhat perplexing testimony as to how the term was first used. The impression he gave was that suddenly, one day, without any warning, Cst. Haney turned to him in the locker room while he was getting dressed, and called him Kirby Puckett Ass. There was no context given for the statement. It is unfortunate that the Complainant chose not to provide the background to the remark in his evidence because his failure to do so could have had a misleading effect.\n[224] Cst. Haney gave the context in his evidence, which was not contradicted. He explained that they were speaking jovially with one another, pleased with their accomplishment at having apprehended a suspect after a difficult chase. The Complainant asserted that he could have outrun Cst. Haney. It seems perfectly logical for someone in the coach's position to have questioned sarcastically, in defence of his own running skills, whether the other individual thought he possessed a professional athlete's talent. Cst. Haney was asked in his cross-examination why he chose the name of a black athlete and not someone else. His explanation was that Kirby Puckett is an athlete who looked like the Complainant in build and in colour. In my opinion, the selection of a black person as a comparator does not lend to the comment a biased or prejudicial connotation in itself. If Cst. Haney wanted to invoke the name of an athlete, must he necessarily have chosen the name of a white athlete in order to avoid the risk of his remark being labelled as racist, as argued by the Complainant? This seems absurd.\n[225] Does the addition of the word ass connote a degrading remark related to what Dr. Henry described as the well known physical characteristic of people of African origin? Several popular idioms certainly exist in our times that incorporate the word ass, but do not necessarily make reference to a person's posterior. For instance, smart-ass is used to describe someone who is a smart aleck (The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary), and hard-ass is slang for one who inflexibly follows or enforces rules (American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition). Cst. Haney said he had no particular reason for having added the word ass to the name, though he did indicate that he associated the Complainant's and Kirby Puckett's running ability with a powerful lower torso. He categorically denied having in any way intended to refer to the Complainant's race or colour.\n[226] The Complainant contends that even if Cst. Haney did not bear any such intentions, underlying his comments subconsciously were the stereotypes alleged. Dr. Henry testified about a phenomenon, which she called whiteness in discourse, pursuant to which white persons are generally not aware of their racial classification as white and do not realize that they see the world through white eyes. In my opinion, although the interpretation of the term being proposed by the Complainant is certainly possible, Cst. Haney's explanation, in the specific context of the conversation, seems equally persuasive.\n[227] With respect to Cst. Haney's remark about how black men shake hands, the Complainant submits that it exemplifies what Dr. Henry described as the we and they discourse. It shows that Cst. Haney views black RCMP officers as outsiders. On the other hand, Cst. St-Fleur did not perceive the comment as having a racial tone. Can an inference of racist overtones be drawn? I am not convinced that the interpretation made by the Complainant is more probable than that proposed by Cst. St-Fleur and the RCMP. I am therefore not persuaded that there were racist overtones in the comment.\n[228] The Complainant seemed to suggest that Cst. Haney's coldish attitude with respect Ms. Cerrato was somehow demonstrative of his prejudice. I fail to see how. Cst. Haney's explanation is reasonable. The relationship between him and the Complainant had already become somewhat strained by the time she arrived at Burnaby in late December 1996. After all, it was at about the same time that the Complainant had complained to Cpl. Fischer about Cst. Haney's training techniques. There is nothing to indicate that this explanation is unfounded or pretextual.\n[229] It is difficult to accept the Complainant's submission that by timing his performance, Cst. Haney and Cst. Carr were expressly or implicitly suggesting that he was lazy, and by inference, applying a stereotype commonly attributed to black persons. It is a fact that when the Complainant first arrived, he was not familiar with the geography of Burnaby and his response times were slow. Furthermore, several senior officers, in addition to Cst. Haney and Cst. Carr, recognized that it was taking a long time for the Complainant to draft his reports. The adoption of the timing tool was meant to improve the Complainant's performance, and indeed his response times did get better. It may have put additional stress on the Complainant, but as I have stated earlier, it is not the function of the Tribunal to determine if a certain training technique is appropriate or not. The same could be said of Cst. Haney's alleged shouting, which he denied and which was not corroborated by any other witness.\n[230] It should also be added that according to the Field Coaching Program Standard, coaches were clearly not supposed to record in their Assessment Reports examples of conduct demonstrating that the employee had met the suitable standard. Only work that did not meet the standard or that was superior was to be documented. I therefore find no fault with the trainers' recording so-called negative acts in their reports. This is what was expected of them.\n[231] The Complainant does not point to any specific evidence from which one may infer that discrimination was a factor in Cst. Carr's conduct, other than the fact that he continued applying the training techniques and practices first adopted by Cst. Haney. Moreover, there is evidence that Cst. Carr (and Cst. Haney for that matter) made additional efforts to help the Complainant pass his RFT: Cst. Carr prepared fact-based scenarios on audiotape for the Complainant to use; Cst. Haney conducted special training sessions at his home. In addition, other than the Complainant's suspicions, there is no evidence to support the contention that Cst. Carr had anything to do with Cst. Marx's filing of a second 1004 Performance Log. On the contrary, the evidence is that Cpl. Avery asked for the revision.\n[232] The situation changes somewhat with respect to the final trainer, Cst. McDonald. The Complainant submits that his biases were revealed in his sketch of Cst. St-Fleur. However, I do not give this evidence any weight. Here is an alleged incident with fairly obvious discriminatory overtones. Yet the Complainant makes no mention of it to anyone at the time, nor does he allude to it in his remarks following his final Assessment Report. Furthermore, he does not raise it in his OCOL complaint, in his human rights complaint, nor even with the Commission investigator. The matter is brought up for the first time in February 2003, in the disclosure of the material facts of his case, and even then, we are later told at the hearing of a sudden last-minute recollection that the sketch artist and the person caricatured have been wrongly identified in the disclosure document. The Complainant's allegations with respect to the sketch are simply not credible.\n[233] Cst. McDonald's remark to Cst. St-Fleur about who is dirtier is similar to the black men comment; it could support more than one interpretation. Cst. St-Fleur, who was directly involved in the conversation, states that the Complainant misunderstood, and that the comment related to his vest, not his skin colour.\n[234] Finally, there are the comments about the RCMP's employment equity program. I am not persuaded that Cst. McDonald's expression of an opinion on this matter is necessarily demonstrative of intolerance to others. The Complainant acknowledged they had a civil discussion on the subject. The interaction between employment equity policies and traditional staffing processes is a topic of recurring public discussion. In fact, the provisions and operation of the Employment Equity Act, R.S.C. c. E-5, are themselves subject to a comprehensive review by the House of Commons every five years (s. 44). I do not therefore believe that an underlying racist or discriminatory tendency can be inferred from Cst. McDonald's actual comments on the issue.\n[235] Insp. Schlecker made several remarks relating to the Complainant's visible minority status, both in the documentation that he filed during the course of the Commission investigation, and in his testimony. His comments were certainly demonstrative of the discourse of we and they. His apparent belief in the existence of ordinary Canadians of any particular colour or origin is disconcerting. It is equally astonishing that someone of his stature and experience within the RCMP would refer to people of African ancestry as coloured, showing disregard for the significance and regrettable history behind this term. Nonetheless, it is also clear from the evidence that while the formal decision to dismiss the Complainant emanated from Insp. Schlecker, in reality, he merely deferred to the opinions of the Complainant's trainers and supervisors, as well as Cpl. Cousins. It is evident that he did not have any determinative role to play in the process.\n[236] The Respondent argues that no inference of discrimination can be drawn from the experiences of Cst. St-Fleur and Cst. Knight. Cst. St-Fleur testified that he had a personality conflict with his trainer, Cst. Marx, and that they did not agree on the manner in which police work should be conducted. Therefore, at his own request, he was assigned a new trainer with whom he was better able to relate. He ultimately passed his RFT. He testified that he does not believe Cst. Marx discriminated against him. He and Cst. Marx simply did not get along.\n[237] Interestingly, Cst. Knight's replacement trainer was Cst. McDonald, and it was under his tutelage that he passed his RFT. He found Cst. McDonald very fair and relaxed. He was at ease working with this trainer. Cst. Knight required an extension because his report-writing was found to still be in need of improvement after the first six months, possibly as a result of dyslexia. The Respondent alleges that if there was a common factor to be found between the Complainant and Cst. St-Fleur, which could have influenced their performance during their RFT, it was not discrimination on the basis of their colour. Rather, they were both francophones working in a unilingual English environment, which put them at a certain disadvantage. Whether or not this was the case, however, I find that there is insufficient similarity between the experiences of the two other officers and the Complainant to allow for the drawing of any inference. Ultimately, there is a fundamental difference between the other two recruits and the Complainant - they succeeded in their RFT, while the Complainant did not.\n[238] Does all of this evidence put together raise the subtle scent of discrimination? In my opinion, it does not. The evidence offered in support of the Complainant's claim does not render the inference of discrimination more probable than not. On the contrary, in light of what transpired after the Complainant's departure from Burnaby, I am convinced that the explanations provided by the Respondent are reasonable and complete.\n[239] The Complainant's application upon his return to Montreal to join the MUCPS as a police officer was refused for virtually the same reasons as those cited by the RCMP. These findings were reached despite the MUCPS' having absolutely no knowledge of the Complainant's assessments and the circumstances surrounding his departure from the RCMP. After interviewing and testing him, the selection committee discovered that he was excessively rigid in his decisions, that he applied laws by the book without taking all factors into consideration (including the advice of another officer), and that he was not open to criticism. Similar conclusions were independently reached by Dr. Girard after her psychometric examination of the Complainant. These conclusions are strikingly similar to those given by all three of the Complainant's coaches, not to mention the other RCMP members who had also made observations about his performance.\n[240] Although the Complainant was not hired by several other police departments, the Respondent chose, during the hearing, to place particular emphasis on the Complainant's application to the \u00cele-Perrot force. The Complainant attended the hiring exam without having studied Quebec provincial statutes in advance. He was therefore unprepared and did not pass. The Respondent argues that it would have been only logical to expect that an exam being given by a municipal force in Quebec would test applicants on provincial law. The Complainant's failure to realize this and prepare accordingly demonstrates the same lack of judgment that was perceived by his coaches and supervisors back in Burnaby.\n[241] Even the Complainant's current employer, ADM, identified some problems with his report-writing abilities (an area in which the RCMP also found him deficient going into his first extension period) and with his answers regarding a crime-based scenario.\n[242] Moreover, one also finds evidence upon the Complainant's return to Montreal of a lack of honesty that the RCMP had also purportedly perceived during his RFT. He never informed any of his potential or actual employers of the true circumstances regarding his employment with the RCMP. I can appreciate the Complainant's explanation given in his testimony. He was in dire financial straits and feared that such a disclosure could jeopardize his employment opportunities. However, I am also mindful that at least two of these employers had made it abundantly clear that misrepresenting the facts on an application would almost automatically lead to a rejection of his candidacy. He opted to withhold the information just the same.\n[243] The Folch decision cautioned that where an employer uses subjective criteria to assess an employee, the hiring decision should be subjected to greater scrutiny. I have scrutinized the RCMP's decisions closely and I am satisfied that the explanation given for not hiring the Complainant is reasonable, particularly in light of the independent yet strikingly similar evaluations he received from the other employers. I have not been persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that discrimination on the basis of the Complainant's colour was a factor in his failure to pass his RFT.\n[244] There is no question that discrimination is not likely to be practised overtly in Canada, particularly within organizations like the RCMP. A human rights tribunal must inescapably inquire into all the circumstances in order to detect the presence of that odious yet subtle scent of discrimination. I have engaged in this exercise in the present case and determined that the circumstantial evidence of alleged discrimination, particularly as it relates to the conduct of the coaches and other senior members at Burnaby, was equivocal at best. A case will not be substantiated where the inference a complainant is proposing is not shown to be more probable than that proposed by the respondent. In the present case, I am convinced that not only is the RCMP's explanation more probable, it reflects the genuine and sole cause of the Complainant's dismissal. Discrimination on the basis of his colour was not a factor.\nD. The Section 14 Complaint [245] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 14 of the Act, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment.\n[246] Harassment, as proscribed under the Act, has been broadly defined as unwelcome conduct related to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284; Rampersadsingh v. Wignall (No. 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237 at para. 40 (C.H.R.T.)). In Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 at paras. 29-50 (F.C.T.D.) (Franke), Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer articulated the test for harassment under the Act. In order for a complaint to be substantiated, the following must be demonstrated:\nThe respondent's alleged conduct must be shown to be related to the prohibited ground of discrimination alleged in the complaint (in the present case, the Complainant's colour). This must be determined in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms. The acts that are the subject of the complaint must be shown to have been unwelcome. This can be determined by assessing the complainant's reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment and ascertaining whether he expressly, or by his behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. A verbal no is not required in all circumstances - a repetitive failure to respond to a harasser's comments constitutes a signal to him that his conduct is unwelcome. The appropriate standard against which to assess a complainant's reaction will also be that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. For instance, a single physical assault may be serious enough to constitute harassment, but a solitary crude joke, although in poor taste, will not generally be enough to constitute harassment since it is less likely, on its own, to create a negative work environment. The objective, reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well. Finally, where a complaint is filed against an employer regarding the conduct of one or more of its employees, as in the present case, fairness demands that the victim of the harassment, whenever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct. This requirement exists where the employer has a personnel department with a comprehensive and effective harassment policy, including appropriate redress mechanisms, which are already in place.\nE. Was the Impugned Conduct Related to the Complainant's Colour? [247] The Complainant alleges that he experienced both a direct, more focussed form of harassment, as well as one that was more broad and general in scope. He argues that the use of the nicknames OBO and Kirby Puckett Ass clearly constituted harassment on the basis of his colour. On the other hand, he claims that his allegedly harsh treatment during his training, the unfair evaluations and the overall micro-management of his RFT, together also amounted to harassment.\n[248] I have addressed the term OBO earlier in my decision. I am not persuaded that it bears any racial connotation. In Stadnyk v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. D\/290 at para. 25, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that where a sexual harassment complainant is a woman, the reasonable person standard should be adapted to the standard of a reasonable woman. The Court noted that there was expert evidence before the tribunal to explain the variance in perception between a reasonable man\/person and a reasonable woman. In the present case, all we have is the evidence of Dr. Henry, an acknowledged expert in the field of racism, who testified that she had never heard of any relationship between the term OBO and slave auctions. She did, however, suggest that the nickname implied a lack of intellect, which alludes to a racial stereotype of black persons. As I have already indicated, the actual circumstances of this case do not support this contention. This nickname arose as other nicknames did in the RCMP - as a sign of familiarity and camaraderie. In any event, as I elaborate below, Dr. Henry's findings were based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts of the case, and their value to the Tribunal is significantly diminished, as a result. I am satisfied that the nickname does not reasonably have any connection to a black person's colour.\n[249] On the other hand, I find that the evidence supports the argument that a reasonable person would perceive the Kirby Puckett Ass remark as relating to a black person's colour, whether or not Cst. Haney intended it to be so. I am satisfied that Kirby Puckett is an African-American baseball player who, aside from his athletic abilities, had a reputation for having a muscular, corpulent build, incorporating what some viewed as a rather large posterior. Considering certain racial stereotypes about the physical features of persons with African ancestry, it would be reasonable for a recipient of this comment who is black to view it as relating to his or her colour.\n[250] I do not, however, feel that a reasonable person in the circumstances of this case would perceive the micro-management of the Complainant's training as being related to his colour. As I have already explained, the Complainant's performance was wanting, and the employer, particularly during the probationary period, was entitled to use the means it deemed appropriate, both to train and to assess the recruit.\n[251] As I just mentioned above, I feel it important to note that many of Dr. Henry's assertions in her evidence were made based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts of this case. Prior to preparing her report and testifying, she had been presented with only a few documents, such as the Commission investigation report and a synopsis prepared by Commission counsel. Notably, she did not have the benefit of viewing any of the evidence relating to the Complainant's job applications upon his return to Montreal. She was also one of the first witnesses to testify for the Complainant and obviously did not hear any of the evidence regarding the Complainant's performance during the RFT that was introduced by the Respondent later on in the case. Overall, the Tribunal has some misgivings with regard to many of Dr. Henry's findings in her report and in her testimony. She drew numerous conclusions based on incomplete information, and in a manner that occasionally tended to usurp the Tribunal's functions.\n[252] I would make a similar remark with respect to a portion of Dr. Girard's evidence as well. Aside from testifying about her observations regarding the MUCPS testing that she had conducted in 1998, the Respondent asked her to draw certain conclusions about the Complainant's abilities. These conclusions were formulated based on the results of the psychometric testing administered to the Complainant by CN, and on his alleged conduct while at Burnaby and thereafter. Dr. Girard did not have the benefit of hearing all of the evidence in this case. Indeed, the facts on which she based some of her assumptions were incomplete. I have therefore chosen not to take these particular conclusions into account.\nF. Was the Impugned Conduct Unwelcome? [253] The only conduct that I have found to be related to the Complainant's colour is the use of the nickname Kirby Puckett Ass. Cst. Haney testified that the Complainant did not show any outward signs that the name was unwelcome. On the contrary, he smiled and poked fun back at the coach by calling him Dumbo. Cst. Carr testified that he witnessed the Complainant use the nickname himself, in an exchange of electronic communications with Cst. St-Fleur. In explaining the name to Cst. Carr, the Complainant did not convey taking offence to its usage.\n[254] Cst. Haney testified that had he been told by the Complainant that he was offended by the name, he would have immediately stopped. Constable Christine Briand, who is a francophone, testified that at one point in her career, someone called her Frenchie. She made her objections to the name known, and the usage immediately stopped.\n[255] The Complainant argues that given the asymmetrical nature of his relationship with his trainers, in whose hands his future with the RCMP rested, he had no choice but to refrain from outwardly displaying any disapproval to them. This is a satisfactory explanation in the circumstances. It is reasonable for an employee at an early stage in his career, particularly while on probation, to be reluctant to put his job at risk by protesting against the actions of his superior (see Bouvier v. Metro Express (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/313 at para. 65 (C.H.R.T.); Woiden v. Lynn (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296 at para. 104 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[256] Cst. Haney claims that there was no racial or discriminatory motivation in his choice of the term - the Complainant argues the contrary. However, for the purposes of the harassment analysis, the nature of the term from the coach's perspective is irrelevant. The nickname must be judged against a different standard - that of a reasonable person. In my opinion, a reasonable person would understand that a black person is not likely to welcome a statement that can be interpreted as making fun of his posterior on racial grounds.\nG. Was the Impugned Conduct Serious or Repetitive Enough? [257] The evidence suggests that the term was used more than once. Cst. Haney testified that he said it no more than five times. The Complainant was not specific, stating that it was used repeatedly. However, I found his evidence uneven on this issue. While he made a point of stating that the nickname OBO was used continuously, throughout his RFT, and this was independently confirmed by numerous witnesses, a similar assertion was not made with regard to Kirby Puckett Ass. Aside from Cst. Carr's evidence referenced just above, no other witness testified to having observed the Complainant being called by this name. Having regard to all the circumstances, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Cst. Haney used the term on a few occasions only, as indicated in his evidence, around the time of the incident that gave rise to its usage, in the fourth month of the Complainant's first RFT period.\n[258] Where the impugned conduct takes the form of racial slurs, jokes in bad taste, and stereotyping, it must be persistent and frequent in order to constitute harassment. An isolated racial slur, even one that is very harsh, will not by itself constitute harassment within the meaning of the Act (see Rampersadsingh, supra at para. 54; Dhanjal v. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/367, at para. 212). In the present case, I am not persuaded that a reasonable person would consider these five or so instances over a short period of time where the term was used, as being serious or repetitive enough to poison the work environment for the Complainant and constitute an impugned form of harassment under the Act.\n[259] I do not doubt for a moment that the Complainant genuinely felt uncomfortable in the workplace, and that he eventually dreaded the thought of going in to work with Cst. Haney, principally for fear of the criticism he would face. He very likely considered his work environment to be poisoned, but I am convinced that it was not on account of any harassment based on his colour. Rather, the training had not turned out as he had expected, the rapport with his trainer was poor, and he was not achieving the success that he had expected of himself. This was unfortunate, but I am satisfied that his colour was not a factor in what he was experiencing.\nH. Notification to the Employer [260] Even if the nickname Kirby Puckett Ass was found to constitute harassment, the Complainant did not notify his supervisors or any senior RCMP member of this allegedly offensive conduct. The RCMP had in place a comprehensive and extensive anti-harassment policy and infrastructure to deal with any matters that may arise. The policy incorporated appropriate and wide-ranging redress mechanisms. However, in order to initiate this process, alleged victims had to make their disapproval known to offenders as soon as possible. If the problem was not resolved in this manner, victims were to report the harassment to their supervisors. If the alleged harasser was a supervisor, the reporting was made to the harasser's supervisor or the commander. The details regarding the policy were distributed and made available to all RCMP members, including recruits.\n[261] The only complaint of any sort made by the Complainant was to Cpl. Fischer during a Christmas party, in regard to Cst. Haney's alleged use of harsh training techniques. He did not make reference to any objectionable names or epithets. Notwithstanding the rather informal circumstances in which these concerns were conveyed, Cpl. Fischer followed up by speaking to his own supervisor, Sgt. Watts, as well as to Cst. Haney. As a result, the Complainant was given the opportunity to change trainers. He declined.\n[262] The Complainant could therefore have followed the same course of action to protest the use of the offensive term, Kirby Puckett Ass. He did not. Nor did he call upon the services of his DSRR sub-representative, Cpl. Allen. The Complainant asserted that he only learned of the services offered by the DSRR during the first extension of his RFT. Yet many of the RCMP members who testified confirmed that all members, including recruits, are made aware of the DSSR as soon as they arrive at the detachment.\n[263] In the particular circumstances of this case, given the absence of any notification to the employer of the harassment, the employer cannot be held responsible.\n[264] For all the above noted reasons, the Complainant's claim against the RCMP of discrimination in the form of harassment is unfounded.\nIII. CONCLUSION [265] The Complaint has therefore not been substantiated and is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 42 2005\/10\/20\n[1] On June 16, 1998, Aleta Gaucher filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that the Canadian Armed Forces discriminated against her on the basis of sex, race, national or ethnic origin, marital status, family status and age by failing to promote her and by refusing to continue to employ her.\n[2] The Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for further inquiry on February 26, 2004.\n[3] On January 13, 2005, the Tribunal granted the Commission's motion to amend the complaint to include allegations that, contrary to section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Canadian Forces engaged in discriminatory policies and practices relating to retention and promotion which have had an adverse impact on women, aboriginal women and single mothers.\n[4] The parties have run into difficulties with the disclosure of documents in preparation for the hearing of this matter. Although some disclosure has already taken place, the Commission and Ms. Gaucher are not satisfied with the extent of that disclosure. They have each brought a motion for additional disclosure, arguing that they need more documentation from the Canadian Forces in order to prepare their case.\nI. BACKGROUND [5] Ms. Gaucher enrolled in the Canadian Forces in February 1975 as a Military Police Officer. She was promoted from Private to Corporal in the Military Police in 1979. She became eligible for promotion to Master Corporal in 1981. In January, 1988, Ms. Gaucher transferred to another trade and became eligible for promotion again from 1990 to 1996. In 1996 she retired from the Canadian Forces.\n[6] The promotion system in the Canadian Forces is complex. For the purposes of this motion, it is sufficient to note the evidence of the Canadian Forces' witness that, during the relevant periods of time, all members who were eligible for promotion were first evaluated and scored by their unit on the basis of certain documents in their personnel file. Together with other documents in the file, the score was sent to National Headquarters in Ottawa where a Merit Board file for each candidate would be assembled. The Merit Board file is a package of documents including performance reports, course reports, personnel record, resumes and letters of commendation.\n[7] A body known as the Merit Board then assessed the candidates for promotion on the basis of their Merit Board files. At the conclusion of their consideration of eligible candidates in a given year, the Merit Board issued a Board Report which explained, to some extent, the process that was followed in developing the Merit List. The Board also issued a Merit List which ranked the candidates in order of their suitability for promotion.\nA. The Motions [8] In its motion, the Canadian Human Rights Commission is requesting an order for:\n(1) All documentation relevant to the Merit Board Selection process for all of the years that Ms. Gaucher was eligible to be promoted, including but not limited to:\nthe Merit Board Reports; the Merit Board Personnel Record Resumes (MPRR's) for all candidates that ranked ahead of Ms. Gaucher; and, the Personnel Records for the relevant time period for all successful candidates in each year.\n(2) All documentation concerning the Canadian Forces' practices and policies in connection with the hiring and retention of Aboriginal members.\n[9] In her motion, Ms. Gaucher is requesting an order for:\nthe full and complete personnel files for five named individuals who received promotions and who were allegedly no more qualified than Ms. Gaucher; the coordinates of the witnesses that Ms. Gaucher's intends to call during the hearing.\nII. Law and Analysis [10] The appropriate test regarding the disclosure of documents is whether the document is arguably relevant. In order for the document to be relevant there must be some nexus between the documents and a fact in issue (Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2004 CHRT 34 at para 42).\n[11] The threshold for arguable relevance is low and the tendency is now towards more, not less disclosure (Communications, Energy & Paperworkers Union, Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, Interim Ruling No. 2 dated February 9, 2000, File No. T503\/2098; Neusch v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation) [2002] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 11 at paras 72 and 73). Nonetheless, it is important that the disclosure request not amount to a fishing expedition. (CEP v. Bell, supra).\n[12] With these principles in mind I will turn to an examination of each of the requests for disclosure.\n(1) All documentation relevant to the Merit Board Selection process for all of the years that Ms. Gaucher was eligible to be promoted\n(i) Merit Board Reports and Merit Lists [13] The Merit Board Reports and Merit Lists for all of the periods during which Ms. Gaucher was eligible for promotion are clearly relevant to the present inquiry. They provide an indication of where Ms. Gaucher ranked on the list that was used to make promotion decisions as well as the process that was involved in selecting candidates for promotion.\n[14] The Canadian Forces state that they will disclose the Merit Board Reports and Merit Lists for the period from 1993 to 1996. However, according to the Canadian Forces' witness, Lieutenant-Commander Tracey Lonsdale, Board Reports and Merit Lists are not available for the promotion period of 1981 to 1988 and the year 1990. It was not clear from the record as to whether the Reports and List are available from 1991 to 1993.\n[15] If the Merit Board Reports and Lists are available for the period 1991 to 1993 and have not been disclosed, I order the Canadian Forces to disclose them.\n[16] During the hearing on the motion, counsel for the Commission and counsel for Ms. Gaucher argued that it might be possible to reconstruct the Merit Lists and Merit Board Reports for the years from 1981 to 1988 and 1990 using existing documentation in personnel files (which is kept for a much longer time) and other information from Canadian Forces personnel. The Canadian Forces indicated that this would be very difficult, if not impossible to do.\n[17] I am not going to require the Canadian Forces to reconstruct the Merit Lists and Merit Board Reports that are no longer in their possession. Rule 6(3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure stipulates that a party shall provide copies of the documents in its possession. The plain meaning of the words in its possession suggests that parties are not required to create documents for disclosure. Indeed, this is how the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has interpreted similar provisions in its Rules. (See, for example: Auchoybaur v. Walcan Seafood Ltd. 2005 BCHRT 35 at para 13)\n(ii) The Merit Board Files and The Personnel Files [18] During the hearing, counsel for the Commission stated that while he was not relinquishing his request for the Merit Board files for all of the candidates that ranked ahead of Ms. Gaucher, he was prepared to accept an order for the disclosure of the Merit Board files for only those candidates who were promoted during the relevant time period.\n[19] Counsel for the Commission suggested that this disclosure might be satisfactory and if not, he would renew his request for disclosure of the Merit Board files for all candidates that ranked ahead of Ms. Gaucher during the relevant time period. To be clear, counsel for the Commission also indicated that he was not going to insist on the disclosure of the entire personnel file for the successful candidates.\n[20] There are apparently some eighty-three (83) individuals who received a promotion during the period from 1991 to 1996. Counsel for the Canadian Forces argued that only the file of the candidate that was last to be promoted each year could be potentially relevant.\n[21] I disagree. In my view, the relevance of the Merit Board files for all of the candidates that were promoted ahead of Ms. Gaucher relates both to the individual and systemic portions of her complaint.\n[22] Firstly, in a case dealing with age discrimination in the Canadian Forces' promotion process, this Tribunal has stated that the documents that are used to assess the merit of all persons against whom the complainant was rated are clearly relevant (Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 41 at 129, aff'd 2005 FCA 154). This is because they constitute the means by which the complainant and the Commission normally attempt to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Although in Morris, the Tribunal ultimately found that the documents were not necessary for the Commission and the complainant to make out a prima facie case of discrimination; this does not negate the relevance of the documents in the Merit Board files.\n[23] Furthermore, the Merit Board files of all of the successful candidates are clearly relevant to the respondent's explanations as to why the complainant was not promoted.\n[24] Finally, the relevance of the Merit Board Reports also lies in their potential to reveal practices or policies that contravene section 10 of the Act. The respondent argues that the Commission and Ms. Gaucher have not been clear enough about the practices and policies to which they are referring. However, the Canadian Forces themselves have stated in their Statement of Particulars, that they have taken all reasonable steps to eliminate discrimination in their hiring, promotion and retention policies and practices. Therefore, the Canadian Force's own references to policies and practices that may have been discriminatory provide the nexus between the requested documents and the facts in issue.\n[25] The Canadian Forces argue that the inconvenience associated with the production of the Merit Board files outweighs the utility of the documents in the tribunal hearing process. Again, I disagree. The importance of providing all parties with full disclosure has been underscored by numerous courts and tribunals (See for example: Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Dofasco Inc. (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 693 (Ont.C.A.) and Neusch v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation) [2002] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 11).\n[26] Furthermore, in her Affidavit, the Canadian Forces' witness stated that it would take approximately two to three months to produce the personnel records for the approximately 500 individuals who ranked ahead of Ms. Gaucher on the Merit Lists. However, in cross-examination she admitted that it would take less time to produce the Merit Board files for the eighty-three individuals who were promoted between 1991 and 1996. Therefore, a request to produce these records would not, in my view, be unduly burdensome.\n[27] There is the remaining problem of the disclosure of files for the periods during which neither Merit Lists nor Merit Board Reports are available from 1981 to 1988 and 1990. I reiterate the point that I made above: the Canadian Forces should continue to use their best efforts to locate and disclose documentation relating to members that were promoted in Ms. Gaucher's occupational groups during the relevant time periods.\n(2) All documentation concerning the Canadian Forces' practices and policies in connection with hiring and retention of Aboriginal members.\n[28] In their submissions in response to the motion, the Canadian Forces stated that they would amend their Statement of Particulars to disclose and produce additional material regarding the hiring and retention of Aboriginal members. No other issues were raised on this point. I would, therefore, simply remind the Canadian Forces of their ongoing obligation to disclose any documentation related to this issue and, more particularly, documentation that relates to the point they have raised in paragraph 1 (n) of their Statement of Particulars.\nIII. ORDER A. Order with Respect to the Commission's Motion\nTo the extent that they have not already done so, and to the extent that they are still available, the Canadian Forces are ordered to disclose the Merit Lists and Merit Board Reports relevant to Ms. Gaucher's ranking for promotion for 1991 to 1996. The Canadian Forces are ordered to use their best efforts to locate and disclose documentation relating to the Merit Board selection process for all remaining years that Ms. Gaucher was eligible for promotion. The Canadian Forces are ordered to disclose the Merit Board files for all of the candidates on the Merit Lists who were promoted during the period 1991 to 1996. The Canadian Forces are ordered to use their best efforts to locate and disclose all documentation relating to members that were promoted in Ms. Gaucher's occupational groups during the period 1981 to 1988 and in 1990. The Canadian Forces are ordered to use their best efforts to locate and disclose documentation related to the hiring and retention of Aboriginal members and more particularly, documentation which relates to the point they have raised in paragraph 1 (n) of their Statement of Particulars.\nB. The Complainant's Motion [29] Ms. Gaucher has requested disclosure of the full and complete personnel files for five named individuals whom she alleges were promoted in spite of being no better qualified than her. The Canadian Forces have disclosed the Merit Board files for four of the five individuals named in Ms. Gaucher's Statement of Particulars.\n[30] The Canadian Forces argue that, in making promotion decisions, the Merit Boards do not review the entire personnel file, only the documents contained in the Merit Board file. Therefore, they argue, only the Merit Board files are relevant to the promotion issue.\n[31] However, the cross-examination of the Canadian Forces' witness revealed that the Performance Evaluation Reports, which are included in the personnel file but not the Merit Board file, are completed by the candidate's immediate supervisor and then scored. The score is sent on to the Merit Board. Therefore, in my view, this document is arguably relevant and must be disclosed for each of the named individuals. There is also some indication that other parts of the members' personnel files are considered in the preparation of the documents for the Merit Board files. For these reasons, I order that the entire personnel file for the named individuals be disclosed.\n[32] In spite of its best efforts, the Canadian Forces have been unable to locate the file for the fifth person. Counsel for Ms. Gaucher has stated that he will explore alternate spellings and names with Ms. Gaucher. This seems to be the best that can be done in the situation. The Canadian Forces are to continue to work with counsel for Ms. Gaucher to determine if the personnel file for this individual can be located.\n[33] Ms. Gaucher has also requested the names and contact information for the witnesses that she intends to call. Counsel for the Canadian Forces undertook to provide Ms. Gaucher's counsel with an indication of which individuals on Ms. Gaucher's witness list are no longer members of the Canadian Forces. With this information, Ms. Gaucher's counsel will be in a better position to seek out the information he needs to make contact with those witnesses who are no longer members of the Canadian Forces.\n[34] In the event that Ms. Gaucher's counsel is unsuccessful in obtaining the information that he needs, he may provide letters to the potential witnesses in stamped and sealed envelopes to the Canadian Forces who will then mail the envelopes to the last-known addresses of those individuals who are no longer in the Canadian Forces. Of course, it is entirely up to the individuals whether they wish to respond to the communication or not.\nC. Order with Respect to the Complainant's Motion\nThe Canadian Forces are ordered to disclose the personnel files for the named members whom Ms. Gaucher alleges were promoted although they were no better qualified than her. The Canadian Forces are ordered to continue to use their best efforts, in cooperation with counsel for Ms. Gaucher, to locate the personnel file for the fifth named individual. In the event that counsel for Ms. Gaucher is unsuccessful in making contact with those potential witnesses who are no longer members of the Canadian Forces, the Canadian Forces will forward stamped and sealed envelopes containing correspondence from Ms. Gaucher to the last-known addresses of the those individuals.\nD. Order with Respect to Confidentiality [35] In order to address the concerns regarding the confidentiality of the documents, I order the disclosure on the following conditions:\nThe names and contact information of the individuals whose files are disclosed shall be whited out; The Commission and Ms. Gaucher shall not use the disclosed information for any purpose outside the hearing; Neither Ms. Gaucher nor the Commission shall disclose the documents or their contents to anyone other than their legal counsel; Additional copies shall not be made of the disclosed documents and they shall be returned to the Canadian Forces one week after the close of the hearing in this case.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

I naturally disagree with the suggestion that my request for further submissions on the application for a penalty under s. 54(1)(c) is untoward.\n[2] The Commission's statement that the constitutional issues under the subsection were never raised in the hearing neglects the rather obvious fact that the Respondent did not participate in the case. If the logic of the Complainant and Commission was correct, it would not be possible to consider any defences in the present case, since the Respondent was not there to raise them.\n[3] I am obliged to reject this line of argument, which would compromise the fairness of the process. The prosecution of a complaint regarding the communication of hate messages is different than an ordinary civil matter. A respondent does not give up his rights to a full airing of the issues, simply by failing to appear. If there is an obvious defence, the Tribunal has an obligation to canvass it.\n[4] I have no fault to find with the Commission. It needs to be said, however, that I was informed by the parties that the constitutional issues under section 54(1)(c) have been resolved. This is simply not the case. The issues that arise under the provision are pressing and need attention.\n[5] There is also the idea that a respondent who refuses to participate in the process must somehow notify the other parties of the constitutional issues in the case. This seems rather forced. I cannot see anything to prevent the delivery of constitutional notice after an issue has raised itself. It is the substance of the requirement that matters, not the form.\n[6] I nevertheless agree that it is best to deal with the constitutional issues in a hearing where the respondent is represented by counsel. This does not preclude a Tribunal from dealing with the matter in a case where the fairness of the process requires it. This is as much a matter of conscience as anything else.\n[7] There is no need to continue the discussion. The Complainant and the Commission have informed me that they wish to abandon their request for a penalty under the section. That is their choice to make. There are no outstanding issues and the case is closed.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nNovember 17, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT998\/11804\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

The motion came very late in the inquiry process, some time after I had dismissed the complaint on a non-suit. There is probably an argument that the motion should have been made in the course of the hearing. I am nevertheless willing to put that aside, for the purposes of deciding the application.\n[2] The application is also complicated by the fact that the Respondent is seeking costs against the Canadian Human Rights Commission rather than the Complainant. This is in spite of the fact that the Commission did not participate in the hearing. I think the Respondent feels it is sufficient that the Commission is named as a party in the style of cause. The Commission has also filed a judicial review of my decision to dismiss the complaint. This would indicate that it remains a party to the action.\n[3] The exact status of the Commission in the inquiry is unclear to me. There is a more fundamental problem, however. The Respondent is relying on the fact that complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act are referred to the Tribunal by the Human Rights Commission. It is the Commission and not the Complainant that decides whether a case will go forward.\n[4] The Respondent has at least implicitly submitted that the complaint should never have been referred:\nGarfield's counsel spent a significant amount of time in preparation for the said hearing before the Tribunal. Had the Commission effectively requested and\/or reviewed Ronaldo's evidence prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Commission would have recognized Ronaldo's inability to substantiate any aspect of the aforesaid complaint.\nThe Respondent subsequently sent a letter to the Commission, declaring that it would seek costs if the matter went to a hearing.\n[5] This is the wrong approach. Once a complaint has been referred to the Tribunal, the Commission cannot stop the process. The inquiry must proceed. If the Respondent was unhappy with the referral, it should have sought a review of the Commission's decision in the Federal Court. This is not a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n[6] I have no knowledge of the evidence that was before the Commission. I think I am obliged, however, to proceed on the basis that the complaint was properly referred. The situation might be different if there was something that suggested an improper motive or an abuse of process. It is clear that the Tribunal has the authority to manage and protect the integrity of its own process.\n[7] That does not come into play in the situation before me. I think the matter should be dealt with in the Federal Court, which has supervisory jurisdiction over the Commission. The Respondent can always raise the issue on the review.\n[8] The motion is dismissed.\nsigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario November 18, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT952\/7204\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRonaldo Filgueira v.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 45 2005\/11\/28\n[1] The Canadian Forces have submitted a motion to compel the disclosure of certain medical files of the complainant, Micheline Montreuil.\n[2] Ms. Montreuil filed a complaint against the Canadian Forces on December 17, 2002, alleging that the Forces discriminated against her on the basis of sex and perceived disability when they refused to allow her to re-enlist in the Canadian Forces. The Forces cited Ms. Montreuil's failure to meet the required medical conditions as the reason for their refusal.\n[3] Ms. Montreuil considers herself to be a transgendered person. She was born a man. However, at a certain point in time she began the medical process to become a woman. She did not complete this process.\n[4] Ms. Montreuil consulted with three physicians for the purpose of changing her sexual identity. Those physicians are Dr. Serge Ct, a psychiatrist, Dr. Roland Tremblay, an endocrinologist and Dr. Martine Lehoux, a dermatologist. The Canadian Forces now want Ms. Montreuil to disclose the medical files of these three physicians as well as the names and files of any other physicians that might have been involved in the sex change process.\n[5] Ms. Montreuil refuses to disclose the files of the three physicians because, she says, they are not relevant. She argues that the Canadian Forces are attempting to make a medical issue out of what is essentially a sociological question of fact and attitude regarding transgendered people. She argues that the medical process involved in changing her sexual identity is not in issue in this case.\n[6] However, it must be noted that Rule 6(1)(d) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure requires the disclosure of all documents that relate to a fact or issue in the case, including those facts and issues that have been identified by other parties.\n[7] The Canadian Forces maintain that Ms. Montreuil has medical conditions related to the sex change process and her sexual identity which prevent her from meeting the medical standards for enlistment. While Ms. Montreuil may not believe that there are any medical issues with regard to her sexual identity and the sex change process in this case, the Canadian Forces believe that there are.\n[8] As this Tribunal stated in Beaudry v. Attorney General of Canada [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 32 at para. 7 (Q.L.), the respondent must not be deprived of the right of access to all relevant information needed to present a complete defence to the complaint. The Canadian Forces have stated their intention to call an expert witness to testify about Ms. Montreuil's medical condition. The medical files relating to the sex change process will be of assistance to the Respondent's expert in assessing Ms. Montreuil's medical condition.\n[9] Ms. Montreuil has also taken issue with the scope of the disclosure request, arguing that it amounts to a fishing expedition. However, in my view, the scope of the disclosure is appropriately restricted; only those medical files dealing with Ms. Montreuil's involvement in the sex change process and her sexual identity are to be disclosed. According to the material filed on this motion, Ms. Montreuil's consultations with Doctors Ct, Tremblay and Lehoux were limited to the sex change process. Therefore, the disclosure of these doctors' files on Ms. Montreuil is unlikely to result in the disclosure of information that is unrelated to the issues in the complaint.\n[10] A point of clarification is needed here. The Canadian Forces have requested a subpoena duces tecum for the doctors' medical records. A subpoena duces tecum is an order compelling a person to appear for examination under oath and to bring with them certain documents. At the disclosure stage of the Tribunal's process, this is not necessary. All that is needed at this point is simply an order from the Tribunal that the documents must be disclosed.\n[11] Therefore, I order that the complete medical files of Micheline Montreuil (or Pierre Montreuil, as she was previously known) including clinical study notes, consultation reports, blood test results and any other laboratory or test results from the following physicians be disclosed:\nDr. Serge Ct, M.D., psychiatrist, CSPQ, FRCP (C), Htel-Dieu du Sacr-Cur de Jsus de Qubec, avenue du Sacr-Cur, Qubec (Qubec) G1N 2W1; Dr. Roland R. Tremblay, D.Sc., M.D. Ph.D., endocrinologist, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qubec, 2705, boulevard Laurier, Sainte-Foy (Qubec) G1V 4G2; Dr. Martine Lehoux, M.D. Centre Dermatologique du Qubec Mtropolitain, 2880, chemin des Quatre-Bourgeois, suite 101, Sainte-Foy (Qubec) G1V 4X7.\n[12] To protect Ms. Montreuil's right to confidentiality, the documents should be disclosed to counsel for the Canadian Forces and should not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and without notifying Ms. Montreuil. The documents may be consulted by medical experts retained by the Canadian Forces for the purposes of this litigation only and should not be used for any purpose outside of the present litigation. The documents must be returned when the legal file is closed.\n[13] In her response to the motion, Ms. Montreuil stated that she has not consulted with any other specialists concerning her transition from a man to a transgendered person prior to 1997. Therefore, it would not appear that any further disclosure of medical documentation regarding the sex change process is required beyond the medical files of the above-noted doctors. However, Ms. Montreuil is reminded that she has an ongoing obligation to disclose all existing documentation relating to the sex change process whether before or after 1997.\n[14] In response to the motion for disclosure, Ms. Montreuil indicated that from the ages 13 - 43 years, she was a transvestite in various different ways. The Canadian Forces, in reply, have stated that Ms. Montreuil's transvestitism is relevant to whether she had and continues to have a gender identity problem. Therefore, the Forces have requested the disclosure of all medical documentation dealing with Ms. Montreuil's transvestitism.\n[15] This issue may warrant further discussion. Therefore, I will provide the parties with an opportunity, if needed, to discuss the disclosure of such documentation, as well as other outstanding issues, during the next case management conference call. At that point I will, if necessary, issue a ruling. The parties will be contacted within a week of the date of this ruling to set up that conference call.\nSigned by Karen A.

Jensen\n2005 CHRT 46 2005\/12\/06\n[1] The United Transportation Union has asked that it be granted interested party status in a complaint involving Catherine Hoyt and Canadian National Railway. The Complainant, Ms. Catherine Hoyt, has consented to the motion and the Respondent, Canadian National Railway, has indicated that it neither objects nor consents to the request. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate in the motion.\n[2] Section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act gives the Tribunal wide discretion with respect to the granting of interested party status (Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd. [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 16 at para. 3 (Q.L.)). In deciding whether or not to grant interested party status in a particular case, the onus is on the Applicants to show how their expertise would be of assistance in the determination of the issues before the Tribunal (Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service) [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 15 at para. 23 (Q.L.); Canadian Union of Public Employees (Airline Division) v. Canadian Airlines International Ltd., [2000] F.C.J. 220 (F.C.A.), at para. 12).\n[3] In its Statement of Particulars, CN has raised the issue of the Union's involvement in the efforts to accommodate Ms. Hoyt. In particular, CN alleges that the Union did not act cooperatively or reasonably with respect to Ms. Hoyt's accommodation.\n[4] The Union argues that it is in a better position than Ms. Hoyt to respond to these allegations since Ms. Hoyt did not hold a position in the Union and therefore, does not have direct knowledge of what went on between the Union and CN. The Union asserts that without its participation, the Tribunal will have an incomplete picture of the case. I accept that the Union's participation is necessary to gain a full understanding of the efforts that were made to accommodate Ms. Hoyt.\n[5] Would it be sufficient if the Union's representatives participated as witnesses in the hearing? I think not. Allegations have been made in this case which, if substantiated, may have an impact on the Union's interests. Therefore, in my view, the Union should be given an opportunity to address the question of its involvement in the accommodation efforts and any other issues where its interests may be affected.\n[6] For this reason, the Union will be granted interested party status, including the right to introduce evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses and present argument on issues where its interests may be affected and on its involvement in the accommodation efforts. I would encourage the Union to consult on an on-going basis with counsel for Ms. Hoyt, in order to ensure that there is no duplication in their efforts.\n[7] The Union will provide a Statement of Particulars and full disclosure of the evidence that it seeks to adduce in accordance with Rule 6 of the Tribunal Rules. The disclosure must include the names of proposed witnesses and a short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness. The Statement of Particulars will be filed and disclosure completed by January 27, 2006. The Respondent shall have until February 27, 2006 to file an amended Statement of Particulars and to disclose any responding evidence.\n[8] The Tribunal reserves the right to address any case management issues arising from this ruling.\nSigned by Karen A.

THE RCMP'S ANSWER TO THE SECTION 10 COMPLAINT: THE ALLEGED POLICY\nOR PRACTICE DOES NOT EXIST\nVII. CONCLUSION - COMPLAINT DISMISSED\nI. THE COMPLAINT [1] In 2001, the Complainant applied to become a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) but, according to his human rights complaint, he was refused on discriminatory grounds, namely his perceived sexual orientation and his family status (his relationship with his brother). He alleged that this refusal was a breach of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Complainant also alleged that the RCMP conducted an inquiry in connection with his prospective employment that implied the existence of a limitation, specification or preference based on his perceived sexual orientation, in violation of s. 8 of the Act. In addition, the Complainant alleged that the RCMP pursued a policy or practice of determining his sexual orientation that deprived or tended to deprive him of an employment opportunity, in breach of s. 10 of the Act.\n[2] The Complainant and the Respondent were represented by counsel at the hearing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission opted not to appear at the hearing.\nII. WHAT MUST THE COMPLAINANT PROVE TO SUBSTANTIATE HIS COMPLAINT? [3] A complainant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley) provides the basic guidance for what is required to make out a prima facie case. The Court states that a prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[4] Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory. If a reasonable explanation is given, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No.1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[5] In order for the complaint to be substantiated, it is sufficient that discrimination be just one of the factors in the employer's decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7 (F.C.A.)). The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\n[6] Discrimination is not a practice that one should expect to see displayed overtly. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances in determining if there exists what has been described as the subtle scent of discrimination. In cases involving circumstantial evidence, an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (Basi, supra at paras. 38486-7; see also Chopra v. Dept. of National Health and Welfare (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[7] In accordance with the principles set out above, and after having carefully considered all of the evidence and representations in this case, I have determined that the Complainant has established a prima facie case with respect to the s. 7 and s. 10 portions of his complaint. However, the RCMP has provided an explanation that is reasonable and not pretextual. I am therefore dismissing those portions of the complaint.\n[8] The Complainant did not advance any argument with respect to the s. 8 component of the complaint during the opening statement or during final submissions. The Complainant did not direct the Tribunal to any evidence that would support or relate to the s. 8 allegation. I can only assume that the Complainant has opted not to pursue this aspect of the complaint. In any event, it would be a breach of fairness and natural justice for the Tribunal itself to try to formulate arguments in support of this aspect of the complaint and then attempt to make findings thereon. The case for the s. 8 complaint must therefore be dismissed.\nIII. THE COMPLAINANT HAS ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE CASE WITH RESPECT TO THE SECTIONS 7 AND 10 PORTIONS OF HIS COMPLAINT [9] The Complainant is a native of New Brunswick. In November 1989, he graduated from the police science programme of the Atlantic Police Academy at Holland College in Charlottetown, P.E.I. In 1990, he began his police career by working as a part-time officer for the municipal forces of Shediac and Tracadie-Sheila, in New Brunswick. In June of the same year, he was hired by the police force of the city of Dieppe, New Brunswick, where he worked until 1993. He eventually re-joined the Tracadie-Sheila municipal police service, and in 1997, he moved on to the police department of the nearby city of Caraquet, on the Acadian Peninsula.\n[10] In the 1990's, in furtherance of the provincial government's policy for the development and implementation of uniform policing standards across New Brunswick, numerous municipal police forces were absorbed into the RCMP by special agreement. In December 2000, the Municipality of Caraquet approved the absorption of its police force into the RCMP, to take effect on November 1, 2001.\n[11] According to the absorption plan, the RCMP undertook to hire, insofar as possible the full time police officers of the Caraquet police department who possessed the necessary professional qualifications. In order to be hired by the RCMP, the Caraquet officers had to be interviewed and undergo medical and psychometric examinations. In addition, they had to clear a security and reliability check. In contrast to new recruits, they did not have to attend the RCMP's training facility in Regina, and were not required to pass fitness tests or write written exams.\n[12] The Complainant was confident that the RCMP would hire him. The absorption had been expected for several years, so he and most of his fellow officers at Caraquet had already undergone and passed their medical examinations by the year 2000. Although he had been asked at one point to redo his psychometric test, he was not informed of any difficulties with the ultimate results. Everything was proceeding as expected by the time he filed his formal application to become a member on March 2, 2001.\n[13] Numerous colleagues and supervisors from the police departments of Caraquet and the other municipalities where he had worked testified that he was a very competent police officer. He was honest, reliable, polite, good-humoured and well-liked. To this day, they would recommend him without reservation for employment with any policing organization, including the RCMP. Indeed, many of these witnesses had joined the RCMP after the absorption of their respective municipal forces and they asserted that the Complainant could perform the functions of an RCMP member without any difficulty. The RCMP's eventual refusal to hire him was as much of a surprise to them as it was to the Complainant himself.\n[14] On March 14, 2001, the Complainant was interviewed in Caraquet by RCMP member, Cst. Jean-Paul St-Laurent. At the time, Cst. St-Laurent was working within the RCMP's human resources office in Fredericton, as a Recruiting and Security Coordinator. He was charged with the duty of coordinating the security and reliability screening for all RCMP applicants, whether they were new recruits, or existing police officers who were working in police departments that were being absorbed.\n[15] Cst. St-Laurent's questions during the interview were varied, ranging from the Complainant's finances and hobbies to his friends and family, and the extent of his alcohol use if any. The meeting ended without the Complainant sensing any concern about his application. Cst. St-Laurent told him that in the next stage of the process, his interview answers would be verified, as part of his security and reliability screening.\n[16] Several weeks later, the RCMP assigned Joseph Yves Desaulniers to conduct some of the field investigation into the security and reliability of the Caraquet officers who had applied to join the RCMP. Mr. Desaulniers was a retired RCMP member whose services were regularly retained on contract to conduct these types of enquiries. At the request of the RCMP, the Complainant had provided the names of several acquaintances and colleagues as references. Mr. Desaulniers met with many of these individuals, including Rodrigue McGraw.\n[17] Mr. McGraw was an experienced officer with the Caraquet police force and had worked with the Complainant for about three years. Mr. McGraw had not passed the medical examination, which he and the other Caraquet officers had taken in advance of the absorption. In the knowledge that the RCMP would therefore not be hiring him, he had sought out and obtained employment with the provincial public service in advance of the absorption. When Mr. Desaulniers contacted him, he was already employed at his new job and was no longer working with the Complainant.\n[18] Mr. Desaulniers interviewed Mr. McGraw at the latter's office in Bathurst. They had a quick conversation lasting no more than 20 minutes. Mr. McGraw testified that the initial questioning was open-ended and related to what sort of person the Complainant generally was. Mr. Desaulniers then asked if the Complainant was homosexual. Mr. McGraw was taken aback and visibly upset with this question. Mr. Desaulniers explained that the matter had come up earlier in his investigation. He was not necessarily saying that the Complainant was homosexual; he was just asking. Mr. McGraw told the investigator that he would be surprised if the Complainant was homosexual.\n[19] Mr. McGraw claims that he was so upset with the questioning, he spoke about it to a colleague at his new workplace immediately after the meeting. He claims to have also raised the incident with Aubin Albert, who was the Chief of the Caraquet Police department at that time. Mr. Albert did not make mention of such a conversation in his testimony, however. Mr. McGraw only managed to tell the Complainant about the questioning on or about April 17, 2001.\n[20] One of the Complainant's other character references who was also interviewed by Mr. Desaulniers was Denis McLaughlin. He and the Complainant had worked together in the Tracadie-Sheila police department. Mr. McLauglin had successfully transferred into the RCMP upon the absorption of the Tracadie-Sheila police department in 1997.\n[21] Mr. McLaughlin testified that he was interviewed by Mr. Desaulniers about the Complainant. He told Mr. Desaulniers that in his opinion, the Complainant could perform the duties of an RCMP officer as well as any other member. However, he also testified that during the interview Mr. Desaulniers asked him a question regarding the Complainant's sexual orientation, although he could not recall exactly how the question was framed. Mr. McLaughlin was surprised to hear the question, and testified that his only answer was that he did not know and did not care if the Complainant was homosexual or not.\n[22] On May 8, 2001, Cst. St-Laurent called the Complainant to a meeting at the RCMP's offices in Caraquet. Cst. St-Laurent told the Complainant right away that he had bad news - the Complainant's application to the RCMP was being turned down. The Complainant asked why. Cst. St-Laurent explained that his file had been reviewed by high-ranking officers back at the Fredericton headquarters, and it was determined that due to several small items, he did not fit the image of an RCMP officer. The Complainant asked for specific reasons. He was told that his brother, who lived in British Colombia, had a criminal record for sexual assault, which played a role in the decision. The fact that the Complainant had previously applied to the RCMP in the late 1980's and had been refused was also a factor. His declared prior usage of marijuana and hashish also played a role.\n[23] During the meeting, the Complainant mentioned having heard that questions had been asked by the RCMP about whether he was a homosexual. According to the Complainant, Cst. St-Laurent replied that this subject was never on the table.\n[24] Despite Cst. St-Laurent's denial, and in light of Mr. McGraw's information about the questions posed by Mr. Desaulniers, the Complainant suspected that his perceived sexual orientation may have been a factor in the decision not to hire him. He therefore asked Mr. McGraw to sign a written statement setting out what had transpired during the latter's meeting with Mr. Desaulniers. The Complainant prepared a questionnaire in a typical question and answer format, with spaces provided for Mr. McGraw to write in his answers. Mr. McGraw filled out and signed the document on May 19, 2001.\n[25] Mr. McGraw attached a separate sheet to the questionnaire, on which he had recorded his recollection of the conversation in narrative form. I have included the following excerpts from the narrative, as they were written. Mr. McGraw refers therein to Denis Albert and Serge Losier, both of whom were persons whom the Complainant had identified in his application to the RCMP as character references. Mr. Desaulniers had already interviewed both of them prior to meeting up with Mr. McGraw:\n[TRANSLATION]\nOn or about March 28, 2001, I received a phone call from Jean Yves Desaulniers, asking me if it would be possible to meet me in person. . . . The meeting took place between eleven o'clock and noon at my office. He said to me: do you personally know Daniel Maillet of the Caraquet Police well? I replied: I think so, yes.\nQ [Mr. Desaulniers]: What kind of guy is he [the Complainant]?\nA [Mr. McGraw]: A guy who keeps to himself. He lives in a house built in the woods in Caraquet. He minds his own business, hard working and polite.\nQ : What is he like at work?\nA : Everybody likes him. We really enjoy teasing him. It is as if he does not feel liked if we do not tease him.\nQ : Is it true that he is homosexual?\nA : What . . . What are you saying? Now, where is that story coming from?\nQ : Denis Albert, what does he have to do with Daniel?\nA : He's a friend.\nQ : Why are they called Daniel and Denise?\nA : That's a joke. Denis is far too macho to be queer.\nQ : He has an earring or a pin in his ear, something like that?\nA : I haven't noticed. Wow, but that's a serious accusation.\nQ : I am not saying that he is one. That's what I learned from my investigation. They are often together. Their Jeeps are almost the same. There is also another guy from Tracadie, over there, who is with them a lot. Is he a homo too, that one?\nA : I don't know him. I cannot swear that Daniel Maillet is not homo but I would be more surprised than anyone.\nQ : Why would he almost always go out in Tracadie and not in town and why with either Denis Albert or Losier from Tracadie?\nA : A few years back, Daniel Maillet fell madly in love with a girl [. . .] from Tracadie. I do not remember her name. He dated her for almost two years. He still loves her even if he tries to hide it and it shows. That's why he goes over there. May be he is hoping they will get back together.\nQ : Whether he is homosexual or not, it does not change anything. He only has to admit it and it's okay.\n[...]\n[26] The Complainant expected to get a written letter of refusal from the RCMP following his second meeting with Cst. St-Laurent, but as the weeks passed, none arrived. Aside from Mr. McGraw, who as mentioned earlier was not qualified for medical reasons, all the Complainant's fellow Caraquet police officers who had applied to join the RCMP were accepted. As the date for the handover of policing from Caraquet's force to the RCMP approached (November 1st, 2001), the Complainant decided to inform the media about what he perceived as the RCMP's discriminatory refusal to employ him. His case was reported on TV and radio, as well as in the written press.\n[27] On October 31, 2001, an article was published in the local newspaper, l'Acadie Nouvelle. The reporter, Sylvie Paulin-Grondin, interviewed the Complainant and several others for her column, including the non-commissioned officer in charge of operations at the RCMP's Caraquet detachment, Sgt. Michel Pag\u00e9. Prior to the absorption of the municipal force, the RCMP had already been operating a detachment based in Caraquet and serving the surrounding area. Sgt. Pag\u00e9 was therefore acquainted with the members of the Caraquet police department, including the Complainant, and was involved in the absorption process.\n[28] To obtain this interview from Sgt. Pag\u00e9, Ms. Paulin-Grondin testified that she had left a message for him at his office. He called her back and she conducted the interview by telephone. She claims to have cited Sgt. Pag\u00e9 verbatim in the article. Sgt. Pag\u00e9 did not testify at the hearing. Sgt. Pag\u00e9 was quoted as initially saying that he could not comment on the Complainant's case nor that of any other individual. He nonetheless went on to affirm that the Complainant's candidacy did not satisfy the RCMP's criteria. He added that all the applicants are treated equally - their medical condition, reputation, character, and finances are examined. However, he also made the following statement regarding candidates' sexual orientation:\n[TRANSLATION]\nBut I can tell you that sexual orientation is not a criterion. The RCMP does not discriminate against a person who is gay, absolutely not! It could however create problems if the employer was not aware of it.\nLet us say that a person is gay and the employer is not aware of it. That could be a risk in terms of security. If a member of the RCMP has a given orientation and does not want his or her employer to know about it, he or she could be exposed to blackmail, extortion, extraction of information. This is speaking in general terms and not about a particular case. But we must comply with the Charter of Rights. That is very important.\n[29] After the publication of these remarks, neither Sgt. Pag\u00e9 nor the RCMP contacted Ms. Paulin-Grondin to suggest that she had misunderstood or misinterpreted his statements.\n[30] On the same day that the article was published, a letter was sent from the RCMP to the Complainant formally advising him that his application was being dismissed. It was signed by Staff-Sergeant Joseph Rogers, non-commissioned officer in charge of recruitment (Senior Career Manager) for J Division (New Brunswick). He noted that in the Complainant's case, the RCMP decided that his evasive manner during the interview and the fact that he provided information that was later found to be inconsistent, raised issues regarding his integrity and honesty.\n[31] The following day, November 1, 2001, the Complainant wrote Staff-Sgt. Rogers back, complaining that he had never been told previously that he had been evasive during the interview nor that he had provided erroneous information. He was shocked by these new allegations and asked for more particulars. On November 22, 2001, Staff-Sgt. Rogers wrote back to the Complainant, advising him that the RCMP's decision had not changed and was final. His file had already been reviewed internally and a complete assessment had been made.\n[32] On December 21, 2001, the Complainant filed the present complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[33] In sum, the Complainant has led evidence that prior to being denied employment by the RCMP, questions were asked about his sexual orientation. Sgt. Pag\u00e9's subsequent remarks that an applicant's concealed sexual orientation would be of interest to the RCMP corroborates the Complainant's contention that his perceived sexual orientation was a factor in the RCMP's decision. In addition, the Complainant has led evidence of being told outright that his brother's criminal record was also a factor in the decision not to hire him. I am satisfied in the absence of an answer from the Respondent that if this evidence is believed, it is complete and sufficient to justify a finding of discrimination, pursuant to s. 7 of the Act, based on the Complainant's perceived sexual orientation and his family status. A prima facie case has been made out.\n[34] Similarly, if the evidence is believed, a prima facie case has been made out regarding the s. 10 component of the complaint. Mr. Desaulniers's questions relating to the Complainant's sexual orientation - coupled with Sgt. Pag\u00e9's remarks - and the ultimate rejection of the Complainant's candidacy, suggest, in the absence of a reasonable and non-pretextual explanation, that there was a policy in place to inquire into the Complainant's sexual orientation, which may have or tended to deprive the Complainant of an employment opportunity.\nIV. THE RCMP'S ANSWER TO THE SECTION 7 COMPLAINT - WHY WAS THE COMPLAINANT NOT HIRED? [35] The RCMP claims that neither the Complainant's perceived sexual orientation nor his relationship with a family member was in any way a factor in its decision not to accept his application for employment. He was refused for numerous other reasons, principally related to what was perceived as his lack of candour and honesty during his interview with Cst. St-Laurent. I have determined this explanation to be reasonable. Moreover, the Complainant has not demonstrated that the explanation was a pretext for otherwise discriminatory conduct.\n[36] The security and reliability screening interview is of high significance for the RCMP, which must ensure that a member's integrity is not in doubt. The interviewer is provided a form on which the questions to be asked to candidates are set out and the answers are recorded. The form is for the interviewers' use only - it is not shown to candidates. The form used by Cst. St-Laurent during the Complainant's interview was entered as an exhibit at the hearing.\n[37] In accordance with the form's instructions, Cst. St-Laurent told the Complainant from the outset that the RCMP would conduct a field investigation afterwards to verify everything he said during the interview. He therefore advised the Complainant to be honest, forthright and complete in his answers. Any deliberate attempt to lie or omit information would remove the candidate from further consideration for employment.\n[38] The RCMP claims that many of the Complainant's answers were, on subsequent verification, proven untrue or incomplete, calling into question his integrity and qualities as a police officer.\n[39] Cst. St-Laurent was not impressed with the Complainant's overall performance and conduct during the interview. He described the Complainant as very quiet and reticent in providing the information being sought. Most candidates are initially nervous but they eventually open up and freely engage in a discussion with the interviewer. Such was not the case with the Complainant. He was not talkative and answers often required prompting and probing on Cst. St-Laurent's part. Questions frequently needed to be repeated in order to extract a response.\n[40] There is a section at the end of the interview form where the interviewer writes his overall impression of the interviewee. Cst. St-Laurent wrote that the Complainant appeared to be very nervous, and that it was difficult to get straight answers to many of the questions; the Complainant could not remember or was unsure.\n[41] Cst. St-Laurent testified that these concerns about the Complainant's answers, combined with several contradictions that emerged during subsequent verifications (set out below), led Cst. St-Laurent to conclude that he could not recommend the Complainant's candidacy. Cst. St-Laurent documented these findings in a memorandum dated April 25, 2001, that he submitted to Staff-Sgt. Rogers, the Senior Career Manager.\nA. Inconsistencies and discrepancies regarding the Complainant's use of drugs [42] The security and reliability interview form contains a series of questions relating to drug usage. Candidates are asked whether they have ever been exposed to or used drugs. If so, they are to explain the type of drug, the frequency of its use, the dates it was first and last used, and the circumstances or motives that gave rise to its use.\n[43] The Complainant told Cst. St-Laurent that he had used cannabis and hashish. Cst. St-Laurent recorded on the form that each drug had been used twice, the circumstances being experimentation\/social. As for the dates of usage, the answer indicated is don't know, it was long ago. The Complainant testified that Cst. St-Laurent insisted he be more specific but the stress of this line of questioning caused him to blank out, and he was unable to give any details.\n[44] Cst. St-Laurent also asked the Complainant to provide the names and addresses of his relatives, as required by the interview form. Many of his relatives live in the United States and he was consequently unable to give these particulars during the interview either. The Complainant explained that he would be able to come up with this information after the interview. Cst. St-Laurent agreed to let him send in these details by fax following the meeting.\n[45] Upon returning to his office at the Caraquet municipal police station later that day, the Complainant called his mother and obtained his relatives' contact information. He then prepared a two-page hand-written letter, which he sent by fax to Cst. St-Laurent. In it he set out these details, but also added, under the heading Section on Drugs two paragraphs specifying the two occasions on which he had used drugs. The first is listed as winter 1994, outside of a high school entrance, before entering a dance that was being held inside. The second occasion is indicated as being in the spring or summer of 1995, outside of a club named Cosmo, in Moncton. On each occasion, he states that he used marijuana and hashish.\n[46] The Complainant explained at the hearing that he had in fact used the drugs in 1984 and 1985, not 1994 and 1995. He did not realize the error in his faxed letter until a few days before his second meeting with Cst. St-Laurent on May 8, 2001. The Complainant made no attempt to inform Cst. St-Laurent of the error prior to that meeting. He brought the mistake to Cst. St-Laurent's attention during the meeting, but Cst. St-Laurent said that it was too late; the decision not to recommend his candidacy had already been made.\n[47] Cst. St-Laurent testified that he had indeed told the Complainant to fax in the addresses of the American relatives. It was understandable for the Complainant not to have readily recalled these details during the interview. However, Cst. St-Laurent was not impressed by the fact that the Complainant took this as an opportunity to complete or supplement some of his other interview answers. Cst. St-Laurent testified that the purpose of the interview is to test candidates' reliability and honesty, by verifying the accuracy of their answers. They are therefore expected to reply in full during the interview to all questions that are put to them, aside perhaps from questions requiring detailed answers, like a relative's address and phone number.\n[48] Furthermore, Cst. St-Laurent was surprised to see the Complainant declare that he had used drugs so recently, at a time when he had already begun his career as a police officer. He was also taken aback by the age that the Complainant would have been at the time of the reported drug usage, so much so that he inscribed a comment on his copy of the faxed document: 30 years old. Cst. St-Laurent did not interpret this illegal drug usage as mere experimentation by a young person. Cst. St-Laurent testified that the RCMP will generally not turn down candidates just because they may have tried out certain less serious drugs while in high school. However, more recent usage, even as experimentation, particularly at a time when the person has already entered the policing profession, is of much greater concern. Cst. St-Laurent also wondered why the Complainant was suddenly able to remember the exact years of usage, after having had such difficulty doing so during the interview.\n[49] Another of the questions asked of the Complainant during the security and reliability and screening interview was whether any police force, including the RCMP, had ever refused him employment. The Complainant replied that he had applied to join the RCMP in the mid-1980's, but was turned down at the interview stage because he had admitted trying drugs a few years earlier.\n[50] Cst. St-Laurent testified that he took all the information provided by the Complainant, at face value. The refusal for drug use in the 1980's, combined with the faxed declaration that he had used drugs in 1994 and 1995 implied more than mere experimentation.\n[51] As part of the verification process, Cst. St-Laurent contacted Staff-Sgt. Jacques Ouellette, the RCMP staffing officer who had interviewed the Complainant in the mid-1980's. Staff-Sgt. Ouellette had no specific recollection of the Complainant. However, he added that for him to have rejected an application on this ground, the declared drug use must have taken place on at least three or four occasions.\n[52] Cst. St-Laurent therefore became generally apprehensive with the level of discrepancies that were emerging regarding the Complainant's drug use. What began as an admission of drug usage on four occasions as a form of experimentation, which had occurred so long ago that the Complainant was unable to remember the actual circumstances, had now developed into a minimum of seven or eight occasions of usage, having taken place as recently as 1995, at a time when the Complainant was a police officer by profession.\nB. Inconsistencies and discrepancies regarding the Complainant's departure from the Dieppe Police Department [53] The Complainant's answers with respect to his employment at the Dieppe police department gave Cst. St-Laurent another cause for concern. The investigation conducted by the RCMP to verify the Complainant's interview answers revealed significant discrepancies.\n[54] In advance of the security and reliability screening interview, candidates must fill out a Personnel Security Clearance Questionnaire, which includes a series of questions regarding previous employment. If candidates have ever been dismissed from a position, they are required to give the name of their supervisor and a brief explanation of the reason for the dismissal. The Complainant indicated in his questionnaire that he had been dismissed from his employment with the Dieppe police department in 1993, after three years service. He explained that he had been suspended and dismissed for alleged errors in his work, following which he took his case to arbitration and resigned for money.\n[55] The Complainant elaborated on this incident during his interview with Cst. St-Laurent. The suspension related to an impaired driving case in which he was to testify. Unfortunately, he was ill with the flu on the day of the trial, and while waiting to take the stand, he had to step out of the courtroom to visit the restroom. It seems that the prosecutor was unable to locate the Complainant when his turn came to testify. For some reason, instead of asking for an adjournment, the Crown decided to withdraw the charges.\n[56] Dieppe's Chief of Police, Terry Rouse, later notified the Complainant that he would be suspended for seven days. The Complainant filed a grievance, but some time afterwards he was fired from the police department outright. He grieved the dismissal as well. On the day of the arbitration hearing, the employer was reticent to proceed, so it offered the Complainant $40,000 to leave the force, in final settlement of both grievances. The Complainant accepted the offer. He preferred this option over returning to a workplace where his activities would be constantly scrutinized.\n[57] The Complainant testified that Rouse was well-known within New Brunswick's policing community as being very strict in his dealings with his officers. He claims that he discussed this fact with Cst. St-Laurent, who knew of the Chief's reputation and agreed that this would probably explain the events that led to the Complainant's dismissal.\n[58] The Complainant had brought with him to the interview documents relating to the dismissal, and offered to show them to Cst. St-Laurent. The offer was turned down. The Complainant testified that he even offered to take a lie detector test in connection with his explanation of the Dieppe dismissal, if so requested. Cst. St-Laurent has no recollection of this offer.\n[59] Following the interview, Cst. St-Laurent wrote some personal remarks on the interview form. He noted that the Complainant's dismissal from the Dieppe police department and his other employment records would have to be examined closely. He added that there may be a performance issue that needed to be clarified and addressed.\n[60] Cst. St-Laurent asked Dale Mitton, a retired RCMP staff sergeant, to look into the Complainant's employment history with the Dieppe police department. That city's police service had by then also been absorbed into the RCMP, as part of the provincial amalgamation process. Chief Rouse, who had dismissed the Complainant, had died several years before, so Mr. Mitton met with the former Deputy Chief of Police, Alan Parker, who was now a member of the RCMP serving in Moncton. The Complainant had listed Mr. Parker in his questionnaire as one of his supervisors at Dieppe who could be contacted for additional information.\n[61] Mr. Parker told Mr. Mitton that while employed with the Dieppe police department, the Complainant had been a poor performer and did not meet the minimum standards of a junior constable. He did not complete his work on time and he never met his diary dates. He was slack in doing his work. Mr. Parker also told Mr. Mitton that the Complainant was suspended and later dismissed on account of his poor performance and his failure to meet minimum requirements. Mr. Parker confirmed that the Complainant had accepted a payout and resigned from the force. Mr. Parker also mentioned that a former Moncton municipal police officer, Paul Desroches, had once told him that the Complainant had been seen in the Cosmo night club in Moncton, drinking to excess and hanging around poor charactered people. He may even have been into drugs.\n[62] Mr. Mitton met Mr. Desroches to follow up on this information. Mr. Desroches recalled having received a call from a concerned citizen alleging that the Complainant had been seen in downtown Moncton night clubs keeping company with ill charactered ladies, engaging in drinking and driving, and using drugs. Mr. Desroches pointed out that he was unable to confirm the accuracy of the information - the citizen had withheld his name. Mr. Desroches simply passed on the information to Mr. Parker.\n[63] Neither Mr. Desroches nor Mr. Parker was a witness at the Tribunal hearing. Mr. Mitton testified and entered into evidence an investigation report that he had prepared and remitted to Cst. St-Laurent in late March 2001, in which these details about his conversations with Mr. Desroches and Mr. Parker were set out.\n[64] Mr. Mitton also visited Dieppe's City Hall, as part of his investigation. He obtained copies of the minutes of the municipal council's meetings relating to the Complainant's suspension, dismissal and grievances, which he also forwarded to Cst. St-Laurent.\n[65] The minutes of May 25, 1993, dealt extensively with the Complainant's suspension. Chief Rouse informed the council that the Complainant had been suspended with pay as a result of difficulties in his work performance since the completion of his six-month probationary period. The Chief stated that the Complainant did not meet his work requirements, referring to three or four incidents, one of which concerned the impaired driving trial, where the Chief claimed that the Complainant fell apart on the stand after direct questioning. The Chief added that the Complainant had problems responding to serious calls involving physical contacts. After some follow-up questioning, the council decided to support Chief Rouse in his decision to suspend the Complainant.\n[66] The minutes of the April 25, 1994, meeting of council relate to the agreement that had been negotiated with the Complainant, in settlement of his labour grievances. Some of the agreement terms are set out, including the Complainant's undertaking to withdraw his grievances and resign from the police department, in exchange for a sum of money. Chief Rouse is cited as having assured the council that the City had a tight case, but that it would cost more in legal fees to pursue the matter rather than settle on the negotiated terms. A resolution was therefore passed approving the settlement.\n[67] Mr. Mitten also obtained copies of the Complainant's employment and pay records from Dieppe City Hall. The City had provided the Complainant with two records of employment to enable him to apply for employment insurance benefits. The first was completed following his suspension and dismissal, and the second after the grievance settlement. Both forms contain a comment to the effect that the employee was not expected to return to his employment because he failed to meet [the] minimum requirements of the police department.\n[68] One of the Complainant's supervisors at the Dieppe police department was Robert Bastarache, who had later joined the RCMP as part of the absorption. At the time of the field investigation, Mr. Bastarache was stationed at the Bouctouche detachment of the RCMP. Cst. St-Laurent asked Pierre Quinn, a retired RCMP investigator, to interview Mr. Bastarache. According to Mr. Quinn, Mr. Bastarache stated that he had heard a lot of rumours concerning the Complainant but that they were just rumours. Mr. Bastarache did not want to elaborate. However, he pointed out that in supervising the Complainant, he found him lacking in experience and maturity.\n[69] Mr. Bastarache confirmed to Mr. Quinn that he never saw the Complainant take any drugs, come to work with a hangover, or display any other sign of substance abuse. He concluded his conversation with Mr. Quinn by stating that although the Complainant was proud to wear the uniform, he forgot [the] responsibility that went along with it. Mr. Bastarache identified the Complainant's lack of maturity as the reason for his lack of responsibility.\n[70] The results of Mr. Quinn's and Mr. Mitten's field investigations gave Cst. St-Laurent cause for concern. The information gathered suggested that the Complainant had performed poorly while working for the Dieppe police department and that he had failed to meet the minimum standards for a police officer. This in itself was a concern but Cst. St-Laurent was also troubled by the fact that the Complainant had not mentioned during the security and reliability screening interview that poor performance had been a factor in his suspension. Cst. St-Laurent began to perceive a significant discrepancy between the Complainant's description of the incidents leading to his departure from the Dieppe police department, and the picture being developed through the RCMP's investigation.\n[71] Even the Complainant's conduct outside of work was being called into question. Cst. St-Laurent recognized that some of the information was based on hearsay and rumour. The reliability of the information received from the anonymous concerned citizen had obviously not been established. However, in his opinion, the fact that the nightspot involved, the Cosmo Club, was where the Complainant had also admitted using drugs in the past corroborated this information to a certain extent.\nC. The Complainant's failure to disclose his brother's criminal record [72] As part of the security and reliability screening interview, Cst. St-Laurent was required to ask the Complainant whether a member of his immediate family or a close friend had ever been involved in any criminal activities. According to Cst. St-Laurent, the Complainant mentioned two of his character references. The Complainant testified at the hearing that both of these friends had once been caught and fined for fishing out of season, which was a statutory offence. In addition, one of these men had been involved in an altercation with a neighbour, resulting in assault charges being laid. He was later given an absolute discharge by the court.\n[73] After the interview, as part of the normal verification process, Cst. St-Laurent checked if any criminal activity had been registered regarding any of the Complainant's friends or family members, or any of the individuals whom the Complainant had provided as character references. Cst. St-Laurent conducted his search on the national computerized databank that is available to all police services, known as CPIC.\n[74] The search yielded a surprising result. One of the Complainant's brothers, who is about one and a half years younger than the Complainant, appeared on the Criminal Names Index (CNI), which apparently lists the names of individuals who have been charged and finger-printed in the past. The CNI report for the Complainant's brother stated that his files related to violence, theft, sex. The report cautioned, however, that this entry did not document a criminal record. Cst. St-Laurent therefore inquired further into the database, and learned that the Complainant's brother had been convicted in 1986 of a theft under $1,000, under the Criminal Code. There was also an indication that the brother had been charged with sexual assault in 1987, and assault in 1998. Both of these charges were laid in British Columbia, but they were subsequently stayed.\n[75] Again, Cst. St-Laurent found himself having doubts and concerns about the Complainant's openness and honesty. Why had he not mentioned his brother when he was asked to list the names of any immediate family members who had been involved in criminal activity?\n[76] The Complainant testified that at the time of the interview, he had no knowledge whatsoever of these charges and conviction. He had been estranged from his brother for many years and had little knowledge of his activities. He was aware that when his brother was a teenager and still living at home in New Brunswick, the police had questioned him one time about an alleged sexual assault. However, no charges were ever laid against him. The Complainant recalls having mentioned this latter incident to Cst. St-Laurent, but he could not affirm with certainty when he did so.\n[77] Cst. St-Laurent, on the other hand, does not recall the Complainant's ever having provided information regarding any of his brother's criminal activity, including the police questioning about the sexual assault in New Brunswick. No mention thereof is recorded anywhere on the form that Cst. St-Laurent was filling out during the interview. The names of the Complainant's two friends who committed fishing offences are, however, clearly identified in the section of the form designated for the listing of acquaintances involved in criminal activities.\n[78] Cst. St-Laurent acknowledged having remarked during the May 8th, 2001, meeting that the Complainant's failure to mention his brother's criminal activity was a factor in the decision not to recommend him for admission to the RCMP. Cst. St-Laurent reminded the Complainant that he had been advised at the start of the March 14th interview about the importance of not withholding any information being sought by the investigator.\n[79] Cst. St-Laurent testified that the RCMP does not have a practice of refusing candidates due to the criminal activities of their friends or relatives. Indeed, the RCMP did not dispute the Complainant's assertion that some of the police officers hired during the absorption process had close relatives with far more serious criminal records than that of the Complainant's brother. Cst. St-Laurent explained that if a friend or relative who is very close to an applicant is involved in serious criminal activity, the RCMP looks into the matter more closely to determine the extent of any influence that person may have over the applicant. However, this factor is not an automatic bar to entry.\n[80] In any event, Cst. St-Laurent testified that the brother's actual criminal activity was not the issue with respect to the Complainant. The concern was that he omitted or withheld important information during the interview, just as he had done with respect to his work experience with the Dieppe police department and to some extent, his drug use. It is noteworthy that in his memorandum to Staff-Sgt. Rogers, Cst. St-Laurent does not so much emphasize that the brother was engaged in criminal activity, but rather that the Complainant had failed to disclose that his brother had a CNI for violence, theft, and sex. For Cst. St-Laurent, this constituted yet another discrepancy that emerged during the verification process.\nV. ARE THE RCMP'S EXPLANATIONS REGARDING THE SECTION 7 COMPLAINT REASONABLE, OR ARE THEY MERELY A PRETEXT FOR DISCRIMINATION? [81] I find that the Respondent's explanations with respect to the s. 7 portion of the complaint are reasonable and not pretextual.\n[82] It is unfortunate that when the Complainant filed his complaint, he was not in possession of Cst. St-Laurent's April 25th, 2001, memorandum to his superior, Staff-Sgt. Rogers, explaining the reasons for which he did not recommend the Complainant as suitable for employment in the RCMP. It is evident from the memorandum that Cst. St-Laurent's decision was motivated by the discrepancies that had emerged following the verification of the Complainant's security and reliability interview answers. Staff-Sgt. Rogers testified that after reading the memorandum, he met with Cst. St-Laurent to discuss the findings. Staff-Sgt. Rogers was satisfied with Cst. St-Laurent's conclusions and endorsed them. Staff-Sgt. Rogers reiterated in his testimony the importance for a candidate to be brutally honest during the security and reliability screening interview. All candidates are told this.\n[83] According to the RCMP, its field investigation had revealed that the Complainant had not been brutally honest. The Complainant, however, claims that his answers during the interview were truthful, and he maintains that the information garnered subsequently by the investigators was incomplete and misleading, if not altogether wrong. For instance, the Complainant insists that his departure from the Dieppe police department was entirely voluntary, and made solely with the intention of avoiding any further interaction with Chief Rouse, with whom he and many of his fellow officers could not get along. Several witnesses agreed with the Complainant's assessment of the Chief, and the Chief's attitude towards his staff. The Complainant also takes issue with the fact that some of the information gathered in Dieppe was based on rumour and hearsay. He denies the veracity of any of those allegations.\n[84] The fact remains, however, that the information and material forwarded to Cst. St-Laurent by the two investigators assigned to this aspect of the inquiry suggested otherwise. They indicated that the Complainant had performed poorly, and that his dismissal for cause would have ultimately been proven justified before the labour arbitrator, had the city not settled the grievances in advance. As for the rumours, Cst. St-Laurent acknowledged that they were of minimal probative value, but the information was before him just the same.\n[85] Cst. St-Laurent had no way of knowing that the Complainant was estranged from his brother. The fact is, however, that his research on the CPIC data bank yielded information that he would have expected the Complainant to disclose. I am satisfied that Cst. St-Laurent developed a genuine concern about the Complainant's honesty in this regard. This explanation is reasonable and there is no evidence to suggest that it was a pretext for discrimination based on the Complainant's family status.\n[86] With respect to the drug use, it was on account of the Complainant's own omissions and errors that Cst. St-Laurent was led to believe that the usage extended up to 1995, when the Complainant was already a police officer by profession. This posed an obvious concern for the RCMP. The Complainant contends that the RCMP should have probed further. It should have somehow realized that the Complainant had provided the wrong dates. He argues that it did not make sense for a 30-year old man to have smoked hashish and cannabis outside a high school dance. Cst. St-Laurent should have realized this, called back the Complainant and asked for the correct date.\n[87] In my view, to make such an assertion defies reason. It was the Complainant who was applying to join the RCMP, and it was his duty to ensure that the answers and information he was providing to Cst. St-Laurent were accurate and complete. He cannot blame the RCMP for taking him at his word with respect to the years of his declared drug usage. This detail was not given verbally during the interview, when a misstatement could understandably occur. Rather, it was included in a document drafted by the Complainant in his own handwriting after the interview and sent by him to the RCMP from the fax machine in his office at the Caraquet police station.\n[88] The Complainant argued that some of the discrepancies do not in fact exist. He claims that all his answers were not accurately recorded by Cst. St-Laurent during the interview. For instance, he denies having stated that the amount and frequency of his alcohol use per week was at the level recorded by Cst. St-Laurent on the form. Cst. St-Laurent testified that he wrote down the answers given and that in any event, the level of alcohol use shown was acceptable and posed no obstacle to the Complainant's candidacy.\n[89] The Complainant acknowledged that many of the other parts of the questionnaire accurately reflected his answers. Cst. St-Laurent's notes regarding the Dieppe police department correspond to the explanation that the Complainant testified having given during the interview. The field investigation, however, presented a different story than that told by the Complainant. Similarly, on the issue of drug use, the discrepancy was not so much between the Complainant's interview answers and the entries on the questionnaire, but rather between his interview answers and the erroneous fax he sent later on.\n[90] Finally, it makes little sense for Cst. St-Laurent to have omitted to write down the name of the Complainant's brother as an acquaintance involved in criminal activity, if the Complainant had indeed disclosed what he knew about the police questioning of his brother while he was still living at home in New Brunswick. I find it implausible that Cst. St-Laurent would have recorded the names of two friends who had illegally fished and not the name of a brother who had been questioned about a sexual assault. The Complainant argued that this and the other claimed omissions were deliberate and part of a larger organized scheme to keep him out of the RCMP. As I explain later in this decision, the evidence does not support this allegation.\n[91] Complainant counsel argued strenuously that Cst. St-Laurent's entire testimony is untrustworthy because he initially testified that at the second meeting with the Complainant, the decision to refuse his transfer had not yet been made. Yet, later on in Cst. St-Laurent's cross-examination, it was revealed that his report to Staff-Sgt. Rogers had been presented and accepted by a senior management committee as of April 27, 2001, almost two weeks before the second meeting (May 8, 2001).\n[92] Cst. St-Laurent explained that there was no contradiction. Senior management of the RCMP's J Division met on April 27, 2001. The minutes of the meeting state that Cst. St-Laurent's investigation findings and his recommendation were produced, and that the Commanding Officer concurred with this recommendation. Cst. St-Laurent claims that the decision to reject the Complainant's transfer had not yet been formally finalized. Despite the Commanding Officer's endorsement of the recommendation, the Complainant's application could still in theory have been accepted. This scenario seems unlikely, but in my opinion, the so-called contradiction in Cst. St-Laurent's testimony, as put forth by the Complainant, has no bearing on the reliability of his evidence.\n[93] Irrespective of whether the final decision had or had not already been taken when Cst. St-Laurent met with the Complainant on May 8, 2001, the documentary evidence proves that the recommendation not to accept the Complainant's candidacy was based on the discrepancies that had emerged during his reliability and security check. These discrepancies raised questions about the Complainant's honesty, integrity, and performance. The RCMP concluded that the Complainant had not been honest in his interview, as demonstrated by his failure to mention any of his brother's criminal activity, and his merely partial disclosure of information regarding his employment history with the Dieppe police department and his drug usage. The RCMP also developed some general concerns about his qualifications as a police officer, arising from the information gathered that suggested he had performed poorly during his employment at Dieppe, as well as from his subsequent apparent admission of drug use at a relatively mature age, well after he had commenced his career in law enforcement.\n[94] These explanations are reasonable.\nA. Did the RCMP inquire into the Complainant's sexual orientation? [95] The Complainant contends that the RCMP's explanations are merely a pretext for the discrimination practiced against him. I have already addressed the issue as it relates to his brother. I find the RCMP's explanations reasonable and not pretextual.\n[96] With respect to the Complainant's claim of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the conversation that took place between Mr. Desaulniers and Mr. McGraw is obviously key. It is common ground between the parties that the Complainant's sexual orientation came up during their conversation. Mr. Desaulniers readily acknowledged that the topic was discussed, but he denies that the issue was raised by him in the manner set out by Mr. McGraw.\n[97] Cst. St-Laurent had contacted Mr. Desaulniers by telephone in late March 2001, to ask him to conduct field investigations into all of the Caraquet police officers who were seeking entry into the RCMP, not just those of the Complainant. He met with over 100 people in the Caraquet\/Tracadie-Sheila area over the course of a week, consisting mainly of the candidates' character references, neighbours, and employers. He did not manage to get around to conducting any interviews with regard to the Complainant until late on Wednesday of that week.\n[98] During their initial telephone call, Cst. St-Laurent told Mr. Desaulniers that he had some concerns about the Complainant's candidacy, arising from the answers given during the security and reliability screening interview. Mr. Desaulniers recorded these concerns in his notebook, which was entered into evidence, and included the Complainant's use of drugs, as well as his possible release for cause from the Dieppe police department.\n[99] Before meeting with Mr. McGraw, Mr. Desaulniers interviewed several of the Complainant's friends and work associates. They uniformly made positive comments about the Complainant, stating that he was an honest, hard-working police officer and a good person overall. One of the friends whom Mr. Desaulniers interviewed was Denis Albert, an ambulance attendant who had met the Complainant about five years earlier, when the latter was working for the Tracadie police department. According to Mr. Desaulniers's notes, Mr. Albert said that he considered the Complainant to be like an older brother. They regularly went scuba diving together, hunted small game, and went off-roading in their jeeps. Mr. Albert told Mr. Desaulniers that he believed the Complainant was a good police officer who would also do well in the RCMP.\n[100] Mr. Desaulniers noticed that Mr. Albert's head was shaved bald and that he bore a tattoo on his arm. He testified that Mr. Albert left him with an impression. In the notes that he took during the interview, Mr. Desaulniers wrote:\nBald head \/ tattoo\nAlternative lifestyle ????\nStraightforward but something ????\n[101] Mr. Albert testified at the hearing that he did indeed shave his head bald at the time, and that he has a tattoo on his arm that reflects the level he has attained in the martial art of jujitsu. He also wore a pin in his ear. He felt that Mr. Desaulniers was judging him visually from top to bottom during the interview, but he acknowledged that many people used to look at him differently due to his appearance, which he described as military. People were often reticent to speak to him as a result.\n[102] Mr. Desaulniers testified that by using the term alternative lifestyle, he meant to refer to someone who is different than others and outside societal norms - someone like Mr. Albert, who had a shaved head, wore tattoos and an ear pin. Mr. Desaulniers found Mr. Albert to be a curious person, but he also pointed out that his notes in this regard were personal. None of this information was passed on to Cst. St-Laurent. In Mr. Desaulniers's final report to Cst. St-Laurent, which was produced at the hearing, he simply set out the sports activities that Mr. Albert did with the Complainant, as well as his positive recommendation. Mr. Desaulniers wrote that Mr. Albert vouched for the Complainant.\n[103] Following the interview with Mr. Albert, Mr. Desaulniers met with Mr. McGraw. Contrary to the questionnaire that Mr. McGraw had filled out for the Complainant in which he stated that the meeting took place on March 28, 2001, Mr. Desaulniers's notebook documents the meeting as having taken place on April 6, 2001. Mr. Desaulniers testified that he followed the same methodology as in all of his interviews. He simply asked Mr. McGraw his opinion of the Complainant. Mr. McGraw said that he was an honest and good person. Mr. Desaulniers told Mr. McGraw that he had already spoken to several other character references, including the Complainant's friend, Denis Albert. Mr. Desaulniers added that Mr. Albert was not an easily forgettable person, considering his bald head, tattoos, and ear pin.\n[104] At this point, according to Mr. Desaulniers, Mr. McGraw interjected, Oh, you're talking about Denise and Daniel. Mr. Desaulniers did not understand this comment and asked what it meant. Mr. McGraw explained that certain unidentified persons, whom Mr. Desaulniers assumed were fellow Caraquet police officers, used to refer to the Complainant and Mr. Albert by that term. Mr. Desaulniers asked why. Was Denis Albert the Complainant's chum or boyfriend? Mr. Desaulniers recalls Mr. McGraw saying, Oh no, he's not that kind of guy, and then going on to speak for around a minute about the Complainant's girlfriend. Mr. Desaulniers cut off Mr. McGraw and told him that he was not interested in knowing if the Complainant was gay.\n[105] He then asked Mr. McGraw, as the Complainant's former supervisor, to give an opinion about the Complainant's performance on the job with the Caraquet police department. Mr. McGraw reiterated that the Complainant was a good worker who performed well. They then discussed what Mr. Desaulniers had perceived, during his own visit, as the isolated location of the Complainant's residence. Mr. McGraw stated that the Complainant lived a somewhat solitary life. This was a point that Chief Aubin had also mentioned during his interview.\n[106] The questioning eventually turned to the circumstances surrounding the Complainant's departure from the Dieppe police department. Mr. McGraw knew nothing about the incident and according to Mr. Desaulniers, this question seemed to shock him more than the discussion about Mr. Albert. On another note, Mr. McGraw mentioned during the interview that the Complainant had experienced some understandable difficulty dealing with the sudden death of his father a few years earlier. That was the extent of their conversation, which lasted about 15 minutes, according to Mr. Desaulniers.\n[107] Mr. Desaulniers testified that, just as he had done after all of the other interviews conducted in Caraquet, as soon as he returned to his car, he recorded a synopsis of the interview on his laptop computer. The entry with respect to Mr. McGraw was 11 lines long. There is no reference to sexual orientation. The concluding sentence is to the effect that Mr. McGraw made no derogatory remarks about the Complainant and that he vouched for him. These same notes were copied word-for-word into the report that Mr. Desaulniers later sent to Cst. St-Laurent.\n[108] The Complainant's sexual orientation is not mentioned anywhere in the report, which summarizes all of Mr. Desaulniers's interviews regarding the field investigation into the Complainant. All of the comments noted are positive, stating generally that the Complainant is both a good police officer and a good person overall.\n[109] Mr. Desaulniers filed an additional document at the hearing entitled Investigator's Comments regarding the Complainant, which had also been typed into his computer. Mr. Desaulniers insisted in his evidence that he never sent this note to Cst. St-Laurent, nor communicated its contents to him in any other way. It was simply a note that he consigned to his file. It states that although nothing of a negative nature surfaced during the field investigation, none of the persons interviewed offered what he termed strong support. He explained that this was his interpretation of the character references' comments, which all tended to say that the Complainant was a good and honest person, as well as a good worker. No one described the Complainant, however, in terms that Mr. Desaulniers would characterize as [TRANSLATION] extraordinary.\n[110] Mr. Desaulniers also pointed out in the note that the Complainant was a single individual living in a somewhat isolated home\/cottage in the woods. He concluded his note by stating that all of these comments were just observations being noted for file purposes. He explained in his testimony that he had initially planned on including these observations with his report to Cst. St-Laurent, but in putting together the final version of the report, he decided that these comments were not necessary, so he did not attach them to the report. The electronic file containing the text just stayed on his computer's disk.\nB. Can the evidence of Mr. Desaulniers and Mr. McGraw be reconciled? [111] In my assessment, both Mr. McGraw and Mr. Desaulniers appeared honest and forthright in their evidence. I am mindful that Mr. McGraw is an acquaintance of the Complainant, and that, for medical reasons, he did not qualify to join the RCMP with his other Caraquet police department colleagues. Counsel for the Respondent suggested that he may therefore be biased against the RCMP. I am equally mindful that Mr. Desaulniers is a former RCMP officer. He confirmed in his testimony that RCMP policy forbids making inquiries into an applicant's sexual orientation, and acknowledged that any future field investigation assignments that he may receive from the RCMP may be put in jeopardy if it was established that he made such an inquiry in this case.\n[112] Bearing this in mind, can their evidence be reconciled? I believe it can. On the one hand, Mr. McGraw's recollection was based in large part on the questionnaire that he completed at the Complainant's request, over a month following the interview. Errors can occur with respect to one's recollection of events as time passes on. Thus, for instance, Mr. McGraw identified the date of his meeting in the questionnaire as being on March 28, 2001. I am satisfied, however, based on several documents in evidence, that the meeting occurred on April 6, 2001. On the other hand, Mr. Desaulniers recorded his recollection of the meeting on his laptop computer only minutes after the interview had ended. Those notes make no mention of any inquiry into the Complainant's sexual orientation. Of course, one would not ordinarily expect someone who has knowingly asked discriminatory questions to acknowledge such blameworthy conduct in his notes.\n[113] But, in any event, I do not find a large disparity between the two men's recollections of their conversation. Both witnesses testified that the Complainant's sexual orientation was discussed. Mr. McGraw wrote in his questionnaire that Mr. Desaulniers initiated the discussion by asking whether the Complainant was homosexual, followed by an inquiry as to why people called him and his friend Daniel and Denise. In the sequence of events presented by Mr. McGraw, this question came quite unexpectedly and seems entirely out of context. Although Mr. Desaulniers's recollection of the sequence of events was not formally put to Mr. McGraw for his reaction, it is significant that in cross examination, Mr. McGraw admitted that his questionnaire did not constitute a verbatim restatement of the conversation. He acknowledged that the questions and answers may have taken place in a different order. The questionnaire was a general recollection of what was said during the meeting.\n[114] In my view, Mr. Desaulniers's version of events makes much more sense and is consistent with the circumstances surrounding the field investigation. Mr. McGraw was the last person interviewed by Mr. Desaulniers that week. Mr. Desaulniers brought up the name of one of the persons he had just visited, Mr. Albert. Mr. McGraw then mentioned the collective nickname that had been given to the Complainant and Mr. Albert, Daniel and Denise. Mr. Desaulniers testified that he had not heard of the term before. Indeed, none of the other character references whom he had interviewed, all of whom were called by the Complainant to testify at the hearing, stated that they had discussed this term with Mr. Desaulniers.\n[115] Mr. Desaulniers acknowledges having asked in reply whether Mr. Albert was the Complainant's chum or boyfriend. This is a question that obviously relates to the Complainant's sexual orientation but I do not believe it to have been a calculated inquiry into this area. It is noteworthy that Mr. Desaulniers did not only interview Mr. McGraw about the Complainant, but also with respect to another male candidate from the Caraquet police department. Mr. McGraw admitted in his testimony that Mr. Desaulniers did not ask any questions regarding the other candidate's sexual orientation. I am convinced, in all of the circumstances, that Mr. McGraw's remark about the nickname Daniel and Denise prompted Mr. Desaulniers to ask his question in a spontaneous fashion, perhaps more out of ordinary curiosity than out of any duty on his part to inquire into the Complainant's sexual orientation for the purposes of his investigation.\n[116] In the end, irrespective of the manner in which the topic came up, both witnesses concur as to Mr. Desaulniers's final comment to the effect that the Complainant's sexual orientation did not make any difference with respect to his application to join the RCMP.\n[117] Most significantly, there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate or even imply that Mr. Desaulniers ever conveyed in any way information to Cst. St-Laurent about the Complainant's sexual orientation, presumed or actual. Indeed, both Mr. Desaulniers and Cst. St-Laurent testified that to this day, they have no idea what the Complainant's sexual orientation is. If anything, Mr. McGraw's reply to Mr. Desaulniers, in somewhat coarse language (he is too macho to be a queer), would have indicated to Mr. Desaulniers that the Complainant was not homosexual.\n[118] Mr. McGraw, of course, was not the only witness to claim that he was asked about the Complainant's sexual orientation. Mr. McLaughlin testified that he was asked a question in this regard as well. Mr. Desaulniers, in his evidence, stated adamantly that he had no recollection at all of having asked any such questions to Mr. McLaughlin. He had a clear recollection of the circumstances of the interview, which was conducted in the basement of Mr. McLaughlin's home. Mr. McLaughlin's son was present during their discussions. In addition, Mr. Desaulniers took copious handwritten notes during the interview. They reflect the same information that Mr. McLaughlin said he had provided, namely that the Complainant was a good employee who did good work, and that he had no derogatory remarks to make. The notes even accurately indicate the number of years that Mr. McLaughlin had worked as a police officer. There is no mention in them of any discussion about the Complainant's sexual orientation. As in the case of Mr. McGraw's comments, Mr. McLaughlin's positive recommendation of the Complainant's candidacy was carried over into the report that was later sent to Cst. St-Laurent.\n[119] There would therefore appear to be a clear contradiction between the testimonies of Mr. Desaulniers and Mr. McLaughlin. Considering all of the circumstances, on the balance of probabilities, I do not find Mr. McLaughlin's account of the conversation persuasive. First of all, his assertion emerged for the very first time near the end of his testimony at the hearing. Parties to Tribunal hearings are required by the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure to file a Statement of Particulars in advance of the hearing setting out, amongst other things, a list of all witnesses the party intends to call, together with a summary of their anticipated testimonies, commonly called a will-say statement.\n[120] Mr. McLaughlin's will-say statement indicated only that he would be testifying that he had worked with the Complainant as a police officer, and the Complainant had the qualifications and character to be a member of the RCMP. In fact, Mr. McLaughlin's will-say statement was no different than those of at least 10 other witnesses, who all basically testified that the Complainant was an individual of good character who would make a good RCMP officer. Mr. McGraw's will-say statement, on the other hand, was quite explicit. He would be testifying that he had been questioned by Mr. Desaulniers regarding the Complainant's sexual orientation. This turned out to be an accurate representation of his testimony.\n[121] The Commission's investigation report was filed in evidence at the hearing by the Complainant. Although the report elaborates extensively with regard to Mr. McGraw's assertions, there is no mention whatsoever of any similar assertions emanating from Mr. McLaughlin. In fact, the Commission investigator wrote that of the ten individuals who were interviewed by Mr. Desaulniers, and who agreed to speak to her about the case, all but Mr. McGraw stated that they were not asked about the Complainant's sexual orientation. The Commission investigator did not specify the names of all the persons to whom she had spoken, but Mr. Desaulniers's report to Cst. St-Laurent indicated that he had interviewed eight friends and work associates, as well as three neighbours. It is therefore very probable that Mr. McLaughlin was one of the ten persons she contacted.\n[122] It seems that even Complainant Counsel had no knowledge of Mr. McLaughlin's allegation prior to the hearing. Complainant Counsel informed the Tribunal during final arguments that he only learned this information at the hearing. In addition, although the Complainant's human rights complaint devotes a five-line paragraph to Mr. McGraw's allegations, there is no mention at all of Mr. McLaughlin's allegations.\n[123] I find it striking that this evidence, which could be considered as equally significant to the Complainant's case as Mr. McGraw's, arose for the first time at the hearing. This alone brings into question the credibility of this evidence, especially when it is juxtaposed against a credible denial by Mr. Desaulniers, which is supported by detailed contemporaneous notes and a clear recollection of the interview.\n[124] In any event, as I have already stated, there is ultimately no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Desaulniers gave any indication or comment to Cst. St-Laurent about the Complainant's sexual orientation, perceived or actual, or that the matter was ever discussed between them. I have not found any evidence, even circumstantial, to suggest otherwise. Mr. Desaulniers testified that his only verbal discussion with Cst. St-Laurent about the Complainant occurred during their initial telephone call. Afterwards, he was provided with an envelope containing photocopies of all the Caraquet applicants' questionnaires, which detailed the names of their family members, friends, and work associates who were to be contacted during the field investigation.\n[125] Mr. Desaulniers testified that he spoke to Sgt. Pag\u00e9 during the Caraquet field investigation, but only in regard to another candidate, not the Complainant. After completing his investigation, he simply dropped off his reports at the RCMP office in Fredericton. He had no other communication with Cst. St-Laurent regarding the Complainant until months later, when Cst. St-Laurent called to tell him that the Complainant had filed a human rights complaint. Mr. Desaulniers was even surprised to learn that the Complainant had not been hired by the RCMP. He had just assumed that the Complainant's application had been accepted.\nC. What is the Complainant's theory for why his application was turned down? [126] In his final submissions, Complainant counsel presented a theory as to how and why he believes the Complainant was discriminated against in this case.\n[127] The story would begin with Sgt. Pag\u00e9. His remarks in the newspaper interview revealed that he did not want homosexual RCMP members at his detachment, due to the risk that they may be subjected to blackmail by criminal elements. Sgt. Pag\u00e9 made his opinion known to Cst. St-Laurent before the security and reliability check had begun. Cst. St-Laurent, as a result of Sgt. Pag\u00e9's request, then deliberately proceeded to ensure that the Complainant's security and reliability check would be so negative, Staff-Sgt. Rogers would have no choice but to reject his candidacy. Cst. St-Laurent therefore inaccurately recorded some answers on the Complainant's security and reliability screening questionnaire sheet. To the same end, Cst. St-Laurent also refused to look at the Complainant's Dieppe file that he had brought with him to the meeting.\n[128] Following the meeting, in furtherance of Sgt. Pag\u00e9's request, Cst. St-Laurent deliberately did not call the Complainant back to ask him if the dates that he had provided regarding his drug use were incorrect. In addition, when briefing the field investigators assigned to look into the Complainant's Dieppe work experience, Cst. St-Laurent instructed them to seek out only negative and false information. It is argued that Cst. St-Laurent also told Mr. Desaulniers to inquire into the Complainant's sexual orientation, in furtherance always of the same objective - to keep the Complainant out of the RCMP.\n[129] The allegedly false and misrepresented information gathered by the investigators enabled Cst. St-Laurent to fulfill Sgt. Pag\u00e9's request, and exclude the Complainant from entry into the RCMP.\n[130] Upon consideration of the above, I have concluded that the facts do not support the Complainant's theory. There is no evidence whatsoever of Sgt. Pag\u00e9's ever speaking to Cst. St-Laurent about the Complainant. Nor, for that matter, is it apparent from the newspaper article that Sgt. Pag\u00e9 objects to the admission of homosexuals into the RCMP. Sgt. Pag\u00e9 was not called to testify by either party.\n[131] There are some obvious logical gaps in the theory. For instance, if Sgt. Pag\u00e9 already thought the Complainant to be homosexual, and wanted him to be excluded from the RCMP, why would Mr. Desaulniers be instructed to ask Mr. McGraw about his sexual orientation? And if such a question was necessary, why was the question asked of Mr. McGraw (and allegedly Mr. McLaughlin), and not of any of the other character references interviewed (at least nine other persons)?\n[132] I have already pointed out that the Complainant's assertion that Cst. St-Laurent deliberately omitted anything from the questionnaire is groundless and that it defies logic for the Complainant to lay blame for the recording of erroneous dates of his drug use on anyone but himself. Any discrepancies were not so much between Cst. St-Laurent's notes and the Complainant's alleged answers, as they were between the answers and the field investigations. I am satisfied that all of the field investigators conducted themselves in good faith. They simply reported back what they heard and their testimonies, for that matter, were all credible. They were at times buttressed by independent documentary evidence, and they often contained positive accounts. In fact, with regard to Mr. Desaulniers, the person who is alleged to have inquired into the Complainant's sexual orientation, his report back to Cst. St-Laurent was the most positive of all the field investigation reports.\n[133] It is not necessary to address the Complainant's theory any further. It is not supported by the evidence, and it is therefore rejected.\n[134] For all the above reasons, I find the Respondent's explanations reasonable and not a pretext for discrimination. The s. 7 portion of the complaint is therefore dismissed.\nVI. THE RCMP'S ANSWER TO THE SECTION 10 COMPLAINT: THE ALLEGED POLICY OR PRACTICE DOES NOT EXIST [135] With regard to s. 10, the Complainant alleged in his complaint form that the RCMP pursued a policy or practice on a prohibited ground (his sexual orientation) that deprived or tended to deprive him of an employment opportunity. The evidence establishing a prima facie case with respect to this portion of the complaint consisted principally of Sgt. Pag\u00e9's remarks to the journalist and Mr. McGraw's account of what Mr. Desaulniers asked during the interview on April 6, 2001.\n[136] I have already determined earlier in this decision that the exchange that took place during the interview did not exactly follow the course presented by Mr. McGraw in his evidence. I have concluded that Mr. Desaulniers's questioning was more happenstance than a planned and orchestrated inquiry, and that it was Mr. McGraw's bringing up the nickname that initiated the discussion about sexual orientation. In addition, on the evidence, no information relating to the Complainant's sexual orientation was ever transmitted by Mr. Desaulniers to Cst. St-Laurent or anyone else at the RCMP. I therefore do not find that this evidence supports the Complainant's claim that there existed a practice or policy to inquire into his sexual orientation, which deprived or tended to deprive the Complainant of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground.\n[137] The Tribunal heard evidence from Normand Goulet, an Inspector with the RCMP who is in charge of the RCMP's human resources office in Fredericton. He stated that the RCMP has no interest in knowing a candidate's sexual orientation. Field investigators are specifically instructed, in the training that they receive at the RCMP Academy in Regina, that they are not to ask questions regarding applicants' sexual orientation.\n[138] The Complainant argues that if no policy exists, why did Sgt. Pag\u00e9 defend this so-called non-existent policy to the journalist? In addressing this submission, it is important to take specific note of what Sgt. Pag\u00e9 is reported to have said. He reiterated that an applicant's sexual orientation is not a factor in the determination of whether to admit the person or not. However, if an RCMP member wanted to keep his sexual orientation secret, it could expose the person to blackmail or extortion. The officer's security, as well as the greater interests of the RCMP, may in that case be placed in jeopardy. Implicit in Sgt. Pag\u00e9's statement is the importance that the RCMP attaches to an applicant's being, as Staff-Sgt. Rogers said, brutally honest during the security and reliability screening interview.\n[139] Therefore, if indeed a policy or practice exists, it consists of asking prospective RCMP members if they have engaged in any activities that they have hidden from public knowledge, which could render them susceptible to blackmail or extortion. In fact, there is a question to this effect in the security and reliability interview form that was used by Cst. St-Laurent during his initial interview of the Complainant.\n[140] The Complainant did not advance any argument at any stage of his case, as to whether the RCMP's interest in generally ascertaining concealed information can adversely affect an applicant or class of applicants, based on their sexual orientation or another prohibited ground. The Complainant simply never made this an issue in the case.\n[141] Indeed, the Complainant barely made any argument whatsoever with regard to the s. 10 portion of the complaint. It was only after direct questioning from the Tribunal that Complainant counsel articulated the s. 10 allegation to some extent. He defined the scope of the alleged discriminatory practice as being the establishment by the RCMP of a policy and practice to ask about the sexual orientation of an applicant, and specifically the Complainant (pages 1841-1842 of the Official Transcript). Complainant counsel expressly excluded from the definition any reference to a class of applicants, and he did not refer to any policy or practice requiring applicants to generally disclose to the RCMP activities that they have hidden from public view.\n[142] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to analyze whether this more general disclosure policy adversely affected an individual or a class of individuals on the basis of a prohibited ground. To do so would lead the Tribunal into an uncanvassed area that quite simply was never at issue between the parties to this case. This would be unfair to the parties and could give rise to a breach of natural justice. The Tribunal cannot deal with matters that were never placed before it, and that were not debated by the parties (see Bergeron v. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e., 2005 FC 879 at para. 63; Beauregard v. Canada Post, 2005 FC 1384 at paras. 26-27).\n[143] As I have already stated, I am persuaded by the Respondent's explanation that the short discussion at issue between Mr. McGraw and Mr. Desaulniers does not reveal the pursuit of a practice or a policy on the latter's part of inquiring into the Complainant's sexual orientation. The manner in which this question came up does not support the contention that it was posed in pursuit of a policy or practice, nor is there any evidence, for that matter, that the questioning deprived or tended to deprive the Complainant of an employment opportunity. As Sgt. Pag\u00e9's comments can at best only serve to imply the existence of a separate and significantly different policy, the legality of which has not been placed before me, there is no other evidence in this case to support the Complainant's contention.\n[144] The s. 10 portion of the complaint is therefore dismissed.\nVII. CONCLUSION - COMPLAINT DISMISSED [145] The Complainant testified that he is still working as a police officer for a small municipal force in New Brunswick. It is possible that the RCMP's assessment of the Complainant was flawed or incomplete, and that had his candidacy been accepted, he would have performed his functions and duties as an RCMP member competently.\n[146] Be that as it may, it is not the role of the Tribunal to adjudicate on the merits of an employer's recruitment decision, but rather to determine whether discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground under the Act was a factor in that decision. I have concluded that the Complainant's sexual orientation and his family status were not factors in the decision to reject his candidacy. In addition, no policy or practice was either established or pursued that deprived or tended to deprive him of an employment opportunity. His complaint is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by Athanasios D. Hadjis\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 21, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT935\/5504\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDaniel Maillet v.

INTRODUCTION [1] In the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision, dated November 6, 2003 and found at 2003 CHRT 37, the following Orders were issued:\nAutocar Connaisseur take steps, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to formulate a policy that ensures that individuals who suffer from substance-related disabilities who test positive in employer-sponsored drug tests are accommodated to the point of undue hardship, in accordance with this decision.\nWithin six months of this decision, the parties shall file with the Tribunal copies of Autocar Connaisseur's revised drug testing policy. If the parties are unable to agree with respect to any terms of the revised policy, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to deal with any outstanding issues.\n[2] Although many attempts were made, both in writing and through meetings, the parties have been unable to reach a consensus on certain matters regarding the Respondent's policy dealing with drugs and alcohol testing.\n[3] The parties having arrived at an impasse, the Respondent, in accordance with the Tribunal's order, is now seeking the guidance of the Tribunal on two issues which deal first, with the definition of Safety-Sensitive Position and, second, with the question of accommodation.\nII. THE MATTERS IN ISSUE A. Safety-Sensitive Positions [4] The Respondent's proposed Alcohol and Drug Policy defines a Safety-Sensitive Position as a position in which individuals have a key and direct role in an operation where performance limitations due to substance use could result in a significant incident or accident causing fatalities or serious injury, significant property damage or significant environmental damage. For the purposes of this policy, employees who are required to operate a motor vehicle in the care or control of the company, either as part of their regular duties or from time to time are considered to hold a Safety-Sensitive Position.\n[5] In a letter dated March 15, 2004, the Commission commented as follows on this definition: With respect to the definition of safety sensitive, I note that this section has been modified somewhat, however the Commission would need assurances that Motor Coach Canada will not be subjecting mechanics who are under regular supervision to drug testing. I therefore suggest that the definition be further modified to state: employees who are required to operate a motor vehicle in the care or control of the company, either as part of their regular duties or from time to time, and are not under regular supervision, are considered to hold safety sensitive positions.\n[6] The Respondent disagreed with this suggestion, considering it ambiguous. In a letter, dated March 24, 2004, it responded: Insofar as the definition of Safety Sensitive Positions, our client is not prepared to accept the change proposed, because the entire point of including mechanics who, as part of their regular duties or from time to time, drive vehicles, is that the employer has a duty towards public safety and public interest. The addition proposed would nullify entirely the purpose of the inclusion because it is obvious that mechanics are under supervision when they are in our client's facility while it is also obvious that they are not under any supervision whatsoever when called upon to drive a vehicle.\n[7] The issue, according to the Respondent, is not whether mechanics, per se, should be tested but whether those mechanics who are commercial motor vehicle drivers and who, as part of their duties, are called upon to drive a commercial motor vehicle should be covered by the policy.\n[8] The Respondent is of the opinion that it is clearly within the Tribunal's jurisdiction to make a ruling on this issue because when a mechanic, duly authorized and licensed to drive a commercial vehicle, is driving a bus, he\/she is a commercial motor vehicle driver and not a mechanic. It insists that it has no intention of including mechanics that are not commercial motor vehicle drivers to its Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy.\n[9] According to the Commission, the issue raised by the Respondent is whether or not the proposed Alcohol and Drug Testing Policy applies to employees other than commercial bus drivers; that is, employees who were not the subject matter of the Tribunal's initial hearing in this case. The Commission takes the position that this is an issue that cannot be determined by the Tribunal.\n[10] The Commission refers to paragraph 189 of the Tribunal's initial Reasons for Decision in which the Tribunal indicated:\nBefore turning to the question of remedy, we wish to make a brief comment with respect to Autocar Connaisseur's new alcohol and drug testing policy. It will be recalled that this policy, which only came into force in March of this year, applies not just to bus drivers, but to bus mechanics as well. This policy is not the subject of Mr. Milazzo's complaint, and, in our view, we would be overstepping our jurisdiction if we were to extend the scope of our inquiry to include a consideration of the legality of testing mechanics. Accordingly, we make no finding regarding Autocar Connaisseur's new policy, and specifically with respect to the question of whether the testing of Autocar Connaisseur's bus mechanics is reasonably necessary.\n[11] The Tribunal further indicated that during the initial hearing very little time was spent by either of the parties on the question of testing mechanics. Consequently, the Commission asserts that the only guidance the Tribunal can provide to the parties in these circumstances is that they have come as far as they can and that they have not been able to agree on the scope of what constitutes a Safety-Sensitive Position.\n[12] The Commission further argues that mechanics are supervised during their entire workday other than when they take a bus on the road. The issue in this case is to try to find a way of systematically capturing those people who may represent a risk for the company. It was determined that when employees are unsupervised, they should be subjected to the Policy. While this is the case for the drivers, the Commission asserts that it is not the case for mechanics. In order to overcome this problem, the Commission suggested that the words and are not under regular supervision be added to the definition of Safety-Sensitive Position.\nB. Accommodation [13] The issue of accommodation still unresolved has to do with Part IX of the Respondent's Alcohol and Drug Policy entitled Consequences of a Policy Violation. The very last sentence of that section states Failure to meet these conditions, including a second violation of this policy, will result in termination of employment in accordance with the agreement. It is the Commission's position that the word will must be replaced in this sentence with the word may. According to the Commission, the stringent consequence imposed by the policy for a second violation for an addiction type disability completely ignores the law and the obligation of accommodation.\n[14] This issue also brought forward the matter of last chance agreements. These agreements involve the Respondent, the Union representing the employees and the employee who has tested positive and has gone through a rehabilitation process. According to this agreement, when an employee who has completed his rehabilitation program tests positive again, his\/her job will be terminated without further accommodation.\n[15] The memorandum of settlement or last chance agreement provided as evidence at the hearing states, among other things: The Union and the Operator [employee] agree that it would be unreasonable for the Employer to further accommodate the Operator's performance beyond the accommodation provided in this settlement and that the Employer's duty to accommodate under the Canadian Human Rights Act has been satisfied. Paragraph 7 further adds, It is also agreed by the Union and the Operator that any further accommodation by the employer would be undue hardship under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nIII. CONCLUSIONS OF FACTS DURING FIRST HEARING [16] In order to better understand the conclusion of the Tribunal on the present issues, it is important to recall certain conclusions on the facts arrived at during the initial hearing:\n[20] Evidence with respect to the state of the motor coach industry was provided by James Devlin, and Brian Crowe. Mr. Devlin is the current President of Autocar Connaisseur. Mr. Crowe is the President of Motor Coach Canada, the trade association representing motor coach companies and motor coach tour operators in Canada. Motor Coach Canada represents approximately 95 bus operators and 115 tour operators - somewhere between 75% and 90% of the Canadian industry.\n[21] Motor coach companies generally have approximately 75% of their employees working as drivers. Fifteen or 20% of the employees are mechanics, and the remainder provide administrative services. Most Canadian companies are fairly small, family-run businesses.\n[22] The motor coach industry operates on an `on demand' basis. According to Mr. Crowe, a typical operator in the bus industry operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As Mr. Crowe noted, the industry has to have services available when people want to move. This means that route patterns may be quite unpredictable: Mr. Crowe cites the example of travel to the United States, stating that a company may not go to the United States at all one month, and then make 20 U.S. trips the next month, because of customer demand.\n[23] According to Mr. Crowe, it is this ability to respond quickly to customer demand that is one of the strengths of the motor coach industry.\n[24] Mr. Crowe described the Canadian motor coach business as a `mature industry', meaning that there is little growth in this sector. Indeed, the industry is in decline. Mr. Crowe explained that charter bus companies in Canada have to compete against heavily subsidized transport providers such as the airlines and Via Rail. World events, such as the Gulf War, the September 11, 2001 attacks, the war in Iraq, the SARs epidemic and the outbreak of Mad Cow disease in western Canada have combined to greatly reduce the tourism business available to the motor coach industry.\n[25] The state of the market creates serious economic challenges for motor coach operators. Mr. Crowe explained that a motor coach costs $600,000.00. Charter rates in Canada now vary between $500 and $700 per day, meaning that bus companies operate on very thin margins. This has resulted in a number of company bankruptcies in the industry in recent years.\n[26] The motor coach industry in Canada is heavily regulated. Because Autocar Connaisseur operates out of the Province of Quebec, it is the regulatory environment in that Province that is germane to our inquiry.\n[27] An Act respecting owners and operators of heavy vehicles (Bill 430) came into force in Quebec in 1998, as a result of the tragedy at Les \u00c9boulements - a bus accident that took some 40 lives. The Bill was designed to increase road safety, and introduced an administrative registration system for owners and operators of heavy equipment, including buses. Amongst other things, this regulatory scheme calls for on-going conduct reviews. The Quebec Transport Commission is authorized to impose administrative measures on operators who have been assigned conditional or unsatisfactory safety ratings. In particular, the Commission has the power to cancel the operating licences of companies who are found to have operated in an unsafe manner, effectively putting them out of business. As will be described further on in this decision, in 1999, Autocar Connaisseur was itself the subject of safety-related proceedings before the Transport Commission, and was at risk of losing its operating licence.\n[28] Amongst other safety measures implemented as a result of Bill 430, motor coach company registration forms require bus companies to advise whether the company has a plan in place to control the consumption of alcohol and drugs by bus drivers.\n[29] There are numerous other statutory obligations imposed on bus operators, including obligations under the Canada Labour Code, the federal Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987, and the Qu\u00e9bec Civil Code.\n[30] Cross-border travel presents a particular challenge for bus operators, as operators providing services to the United States are also subject to American laws, including laws relating to drug testing.\n[...]\n[32] American law requires that bus drivers operating vehicles in the United States be subjected to pre-employment, random, post-accident and for-cause drug testing. The testing process is subject to strict regulation, and there are stringent protocols in place regarding the collection and analysis of samples.\n[33] Several witnesses testified that the use of drug testing in the transportation industry was introduced as a part of the American War on Drugs. Whatever the reasons for the enactment of the legislation, as of July 1, 1996, commercial motor vehicle operators driving in the United States are subject to Federal Department of Transportation Alcohol and Drug Testing Regulations. This legislation also applies to Canadian companies driving in the United States, as well as to any Canadian driver who has the reasonable potential for crossing the border. According to Ms. Butler [qualified as an expert in policy development and implementation for issues relating to alcohol and drugs in the workplace], this means any driver ... who can, will or does cross the border.\n[34] Ms. Butler testified that infractions of the law are treated very seriously by the American authorities: companies are liable to fines of up to $10,000 (US), per driver, per trip, if drivers enter American territory without having been tested for alcohol or drugs. American government auditors regularly visit bus companies in Canada, in order to ensure that any cross-border travel is carried out in accordance with the American regulatory regime. Flagrant violations of U.S. law can result in the cancellation of the certification that bus companies require to drive in the States.\n[...]\n[40] As was previously noted, the bus industry in Quebec is under the supervision of the Quebec Transport Commission. In late 1997, Mr. Devlin became aware that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance-automobile du Qu\u00e9bec (or SAAQ) had commenced proceedings before the Transport Commission against Autocar Connaisseur. SAAQ was evidently seeking to have Autocar Connaisseur's operating license cancelled because of the way that the company was conducting its business. Autocar Connaisseur's new owners discovered that the company had previously lost its right to certify the roadworthiness of its buses, because of earlier problems with the Transport Commission. According to Mr. Devlin, at this point, serious consideration was given to simply shutting the company down, although ultimately the decision was taken to work with the SAAQ, to try to turn the situation around.\n[41] Mr. Devlin testified that he attended a show-cause hearing before the Transport Commission in January of 1999. At the hearing, Mr. Devlin explained the different programs that he was going to implement at the company, dealing with bus safety and driver education. Mr. Devlin advised the Commission that it would take six to nine months before the company would be in total compliance with the applicable regulations. The hearing resulted in a warning to Autocar Connaisseur that any further infractions would result in the automatic cancellation of the company's operating licence. Such a step would mean the end of Autocar Connaisseur.\n[42] One of the measures taken by Autocar Connaisseur to satisfy the commitments made to the Transport Commission was a review of the implementation of the company's drug testing policy. [...]\n[...]\n[104] The onus is on Autocar Connaisseur to establish that its refusal to tolerate employees having drug metabolites in their system while at work is reasonably necessary to accomplish the company's goal of promoting road safety, by preventing driver impairment. To show that the zero tolerance standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible for Autocar Connaisseur to accommodate disabled employees who test positive for drugs, without imposing undue hardship on the company.\n[105] In examining whether Autocar Connaisseur's drug testing policy is reasonably necessary to promote road safety, consideration must first be given to the employment context in which Autocar Connaisseur's bus drivers operate.\n[106] Mr. Devlin described the duties associated with driving a motor coach, explaining that alertness, as well as an ability to `multi-task' are essential. In addition to having to navigate a large vehicle through traffic, drivers have to be aware of the passengers at all times. By way of example, Mr. Devlin says a driver has to be aware if a passenger gets up to use the washroom, as a quick manoeuver by the driver could result in serious injury to the passenger.\n[107] Further, the environment in which motor coach drivers work makes it very difficult for bus companies to ensure that drivers are always up to the task.\n[108] Unlike the situation in previous drug testing cases, where employees worked under fairly close supervision inside bank offices (TD Bank), petroleum processing plants (Entropy) or the administrative offices of an Indian Band (Elizabeth M\u00e9tis Settlement), bus drivers at Autocar Connaisseur spend a considerable portion of their time on the road, away from the watchful eye of their superiors. Drivers doing casino and airport runs would be on the road much of each day, whereas drivers taking charter groups on tour could be away from the Autocar Connaisseur offices for as much as thirty days at a time. While drivers check in with Autocar Connaisseur dispatchers each day by telephone, the company is unable to verify that the driver had actually carried out the necessary pre-trip inspections, or to properly assess if the driver is indeed fit to drive.\n[...]\n[110] This inability on the part of Autocar Connaisseur management to closely supervise its workforce presents particular challenges for the company in monitoring employee performance. These difficulties are compounded by the somewhat transient nature of much of Autocar Connaisseur's workforce, with many drivers working for the company on a seasonal basis.\n[111] Mr. Crowe described the precarious economic position of the Canadian motor coach industry, indicating that the situation at Autocar Connaisseur was no different than that at other Canadian motor coach companies. As Mr. Devlin explained, Autocar Connaisseur's ability to monitor its workforce was also limited by the financial constraints under which the company operated. Mr. Devlin testified that in 1999, Autocar Connaisseur had a fleet of 125 buses. Although the company generated gross revenues of $10 million in 1998, in fact, Autocar Connaisseur was losing substantial sums of money. Mr. Devlin quickly realized that the charter market in Quebec was simply not there to support a fleet of that size. The decision was thus made to reduce the size of Autocar Connaisseur's fleet, and the company currently operates 29 vehicles.\n[...]\n[119] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson each gave testimony with respect to the effects of cannabis consumption on the human brain, and once again were in substantial agreement on many points. The active ingredient in cannabis is Nine Delta tetrahydrocannabinol or 9THC. The level of 9THC in the cannabis available in Canada today is significantly higher than in the past, and the drug accordingly that much more potent.\n[...]\n[125] Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson agree that individuals employed in safety sensitive positions - that is, positions where an employee could put his own safety or the safety of others at risk -should not be performing tasks such as driving motor vehicles while their ability to drive is impaired by the use of cannabis.\n[...]\n[128] Insofar as the transportation industry is concerned, Ms. Butler testified that the Canadian government's lack of involvement in regulating alcohol and drug testing means that there is a limited amount of Canadian research available in this area. She did refer to a study conducted by the British Columbia Trucking Association in 1989. According to Ms. Butler, three-quarters of the drivers surveyed reported that alcohol had compromised safety, with one in nine drivers admitting that his or her own alcohol use had compromised safety at work. Seven out of ten drivers reported having worked while affected by alcohol, and half of the drivers reported knowing other drivers who drank at work. With respect to drugs, three-quarters of the drivers surveyed reported that drug use had compromised safety, with one in twelve drivers admitting that his or her own drug use had compromised safety at work.\n[129] This evidence certainly suggests that the use of drugs by drivers in the transportation industry is a real problem, with significant implications for public safety.\n[...]\n[168] It is clear from the testimony of Dr. Baker and Dr. Chiasson that there is no single, ideal means of detecting employee impairment, or of identifying those who are at increased risk of being intoxicated in the workplace. While the approach advocated by Dr. Baker is a good one, in principle, it is clear from the evidence of Dr. Chiasson that it will not necessarily catch all of those employees who are at risk of putting the lives of passengers in jeopardy. We are also not persuaded that, in the specific context in which Autocar Connaisseur found itself during the summer of 1999, that Dr. Baker's method would have been all that workable.\n[169] First of all, Dr. Baker's approach relies to a large extent upon the observations of supervisors. While such an approach may work well in a factory or office environment, where employees are closely supervised, it is less useful in a work environment such as that at Autocar Connaisseur, where bus drivers are unsupervised for much of the time.\n[...]\n[171] Although a positive drug test does not indicate that a bus driver was actually impaired while on the job, for the reasons discussed earlier in this decision, we are satisfied that a positive test result is a `red flag', to use Dr. Chiasson's term. The presence of cannabis metabolite in an employee's urine does assist in identifying drivers who are at an elevated risk of accident.\n[172] We have also found that the presence of a drug testing policy will serve to deter at least some employees from using alcohol or drugs in the workplace, in a manner that would put themselves or others in danger.\n[173] For these reasons, we find that Autocar Connaisseur's drug testing policy is reasonably necessary to accomplish the company's legitimate work-related goal of promoting road safety.\n[174] There is one further reason why we have concluded that Autocar Connaisseur's drug testing policy is reasonably necessary, and that is the company's obligation to comply with American drug testing legislation. [...]\n[175] For these reasons, we find that Autocar Connaisseur has met the burden on it of establishing that subjecting its employees to pre-employment and random drug testing is a legitimate way to promote road safety.\n[176] That is not the end of the matter, however. According to the Supreme Court decisions in Meiorin and Grismer, in order to satisfy the third element of the bona fide occupational requirement defense, Autocar Connaisseur must also show that it is impossible for it to accommodate employees who test positive for drugs, and who suffer from a drug-related disability, without imposing undue hardship on the company.\n[...]\n[186] At the very minimum, however, a company such as Autocar Connaisseur should be able to extend the same opportunity to a substance-dependent driver who has tested positive as it does to drivers who come forward voluntarily with substance abuse problems. That is, these individuals should be afforded the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and to return to work when they are fit to do so. In our view, the company would also be justified in implementing appropriate follow-up monitoring measures to ensure that the individual continues to abstain from the use of alcohol or drugs. Finally, Autocar Connaisseur may also be able to terminate the employment of those individuals who fail to rehabilitate themselves after being afforded the reasonable opportunity to do so, although each of these situations would have to be carefully considered, on a case-by-case basis.\n[...]\n[189] Before turning to the question of remedy, we wish to make a brief comment with respect to Autocar Connaisseur's new alcohol and drug testing policy. It will be recalled that this policy, which only came into force in March of this year, applies not just to bus drivers, but to bus mechanics as well. This policy is not the subject of Mr. Milazzo's complaint, and, in our view, we would be overstepping our jurisdiction if we were to extend the scope of our inquiry to include a consideration of the legality of testing mechanics. Accordingly, we make no finding regarding Autocar Connaisseur's new policy, and specifically with respect to the question of whether the testing of Autocar Connaisseur's bus mechanics is reasonably necessary.\nIV. THE DECISION [17] We will deal first with the issue of the definition of safety-sensitive position. In its proposed policy, the Respondent suggested that it apply to employees who are required to operate a motor vehicle in the care or control of the company, either as part of their regular duties or from time to time. The Commission suggested that the following words be added to this definition: and are not under regular supervision.\n[18] We do not agree with the Commission that those words are necessary in the present context. The evidence submitted at the initial hearing clearly established that one of the reasons why the Respondent wanted to submit its bus drivers to drug and alcohol testing was because bus drivers spend a considerable portion of their time on the road, away from the watchful eye of their superiors. Drivers can be on the road much of each day or longer. In these situations, the company is unable to properly supervise their drivers. We feel that adding the words suggested by the Commission would do nothing more than create uncertainty as to the meaning of regular supervision.\n[19] It has been well established in the evidence given at the initial hearing that the inability of the Respondent to closely supervise its workforce presents particular challenges for the company. Furthermore, it was also established that the Respondent's ability to monitor its workforce is limited by the financial constraints under which the company operates.\n[20] Before turning to the other issue, we wish to add that the definition of safety-sensitive position applies only to those employees who are licensed to drive a bus and who are required to operate a bus, either as part of their regular duties or from time to time. It thus applies to bus mechanics who are licensed to drive a bus and called upon to drive a bus in the performance of their work.\n[21] This said, we reiterate that the Tribunal would be overstepping its jurisdiction if it were to extend the scope of its inquiry to include a consideration of the legality of testing the mechanics or other employees not licensed to drive buses. Accordingly, we make no finding with respect to the question of whether the testing of these employees is reasonably necessary.\n[22] With regards to the second issue, it has to do with Part IX of the Policy entitled Consequences of a Policy Violation. The last sentence of that section states that Failure to meet these conditions, including a second violation of this policy, will result in termination of employment in accordance with the agreement.\n[23] It is the Tribunal's opinion that the use of the word will imposes an inflexible consequence for a second violation of an addiction type disability. In our initial decision, we indicated clearly, at paragraph 186, that the Respondent may also be able to terminate the employment of those individuals who fail to rehabilitate themselves after being afforded the reasonable opportunity to do so, although each of these situations would have to be carefully considered, on a case-by-case basis. [Emphasis added] It is clear that, although we felt that the Respondent might be justified in terminating an employee who failed to rehabilitate himself\/herself, we were of the opinion that every situation needed to be considered and justified on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, in order to comply with our initial ruling, we order that may be substituted for will in the last sentence of the section entitled Consequences of a Policy Violation of Part IX of the Alcohol and Drug Policy.\n[24] This matter also raises the issue of the last chance agreement. As the evidence submitted at the hearing established, the Respondent now requires employees who return to work after going through a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program to sign a last chance agreement\", also referred to as a Memorandum of Settlement. The last chance agreement states that if an employee fails another alcohol or drug test after having gone through a rehabilitation program, no further accommodation will be considered and employment with the Respondent will be terminated.\n[25] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has not dealt with such agreements in the past. Last chance agreements have been considered, however, by arbitrators and provincial human rights tribunals and commissions.\n[26] The Ontario decision in Re: Ontario Human Rights Commission et al and Gaines Pet Foods Corp. et al (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 290 sets out the basic law on this subject. In that decision, a last chance agreement was considered illegal and unenforceable in the context of an employee coping with a disability on returning to the workplace. There, the Court was concerned with an employee with cancer who was returning to the workplace after a lengthy absence due to her cancer treatment. Upon her return to work, the employer imposed a restrictive condition on her continued employment, which stated that she must maintain a level of attendance equal to or better than the average for the hourly rated employees in the plant. Her failure to meet this standard at any time would result in the termination of her employment.\n[27] The Court concluded that the proximity if not primary cause of the restrictive condition... arose directly from Ms. Black's absence due to her disability... the imposition of the restrictive condition was discriminatory, stemming as it did directly from her absence due to handicap... It was a condition not required of any other employee and it carried with it the sanction of immediate termination for non-compliance.\n[28] The Court further added that even if it could be said that she agreed to the restrictive condition, such agreement would be unenforceable\", as provided by the Supreme Court of Canada dictum in Ontario (Human Right Commission) v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R.202 where the Supreme Court held that [Human Rights legislation] has been enacted by the Legislature...for the benefit of the community at large and of its individual members and clearly falls within the category of enactment which may not be waived or varied by private contract...\n[29] The issue of an alcohol addicted employee and last chance agreement was also considered in the arbitration decision Re: Camcar Textron Canada Ltd. and United Steelworkers of America Local 0222 (Commerford) (2001) 90 L.A.C. (4th) 305. In that case, an employee had returned to work under a last chance agreement concerning lateness and attendance. Following arguments concerning the ultimate reason for the termination of the employee and whether any of the absences or lateness were due to alcoholism, the arbitrator concluded:\n...for the reasons reviewed in the Ottawa-Carleton case, and arising from the approach taken in Gaines Pet Foods... this issue is of limited consequence, as the breach of the Code arises for the imposition upon the grievor, for reasons arising from his disability, of a standard, the breach of which for any reason not specifically excepted would result in the most serious consequences, which was not imposed upon other employees. There can be no doubt that the breach of that standard was the cause, indeed here the only cause asserted, for his termination, and thus the enforcement of the discriminatory standard, regardless of the reasons leading to its breach by the grievor, must come under the scrutiny of the Code provisions concerning discrimination on the basis of handicap.\n[30] Although these decisions are in some ways quite different from the one before us, they do raise important issue concerning the legality and enforceability of last chance agreement and the possibility for the parties to contract out or waive certain rights contained in human rights legislation.\n[31] In Re: Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Canadian Counsel of Railway Operating Unions (United Transportation Union) (2002), C.R.O.A. Decisions No. 3269 (Picher), the arbitrator notes that while last chance agreements have an important role as an instrument in rehabilitation and in some circumstances as a form of accommodation for an addicted employee, the violation of such an agreement cannot lawfully result in automatic dismissal. Each case must be reviewed on its own merits and a finding of accommodation to the point of undue hardship must have been reached in order to justify termination of a disabled employee.\nCanadian jurisprudence does not, however, confirm that the violation of an agreement of the type which is the subject of this grievance must automatically result in an employee's termination. It is well established that each case must be reviewed on the merits of its own particular facts, and that in any event the application of any such agreement cannot be in violation of the duty of accommodation owed to an employee with a disability, in keeping with human rights codes such as the Canadian Human Rights Act (Re Toronto Transit Commission and Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 114, (1990) 75 L.A.C. (4th) 180 (Davie); Re Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and Ottawa-Carleton Public Employees Union, Local 503 (2000) 89 L.A.C. (4th) 412 (Mitchnick); Re Camcar Textron Canada Ltd. and United Steelworkers of America, Local 3222 (2001) 99 L.A.C. (4th) 305 (Chapman)).\nAs the jurisprudence reflects, in many cases arbitrators will conclude that the history of employees' treatment, culminating in a last chance agreement, reflects a sufficient degree of accommodation to support the conclusion that any further continuation of the employment relationship would be tantamount to undue hardship upon the employer. That is the analysis which has to be made in each case. The mere fact of a last chance agreement does not, of itself, confirm whether there has been sufficient compliance with the duty of accommodation established under human rights legislation of general application, legislation which the parties cannot contract out of as determined by the Supreme Court of Canada ( Re Etobicoke (Borough) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2002 at p. 213.\n[32] It is also the opinion of this Tribunal that, even without a last chance agreement having been signed, in many cases the history of the employees' treatment, the context of the employment environment for bus drivers, the importance of promoting road safety and the regulatory environment of the transportation industry, as they were put in evidence during the initial hearing, will reflect, in the words of the decision in Re: Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Canadian Counsel of Railway Operating Unions (United Transportation Union), a sufficient degree of accommodation to support the conclusion that any further continuation of the employment relationship would be tantamount to undue hardship upon the employer. But again, we repeat that this analysis must be made on a case-by-case basis.\n[33] The fact that the parties have agreed to a last chance agreement which states that they have decided that it would be unreasonable for the employer to further accommodate the employee beyond the first accommodation and that any further accommodation by the employer would be undue hardship under the Canadian Human Rights Act, does not, of itself, confirm whether there has been sufficient compliance with the duty of accommodation established under human rights legislation of general application, legislation which the parties cannot contract out. (Re: Etobicoke (Borough) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2002 at p. 213.\n[34] Accordingly, the last chance agreement is in the Tribunal's opinion unenforceable in regards to the Act. As the case law indicates, an analysis must be made in each case to determine whether or not it is impossible for the employer to accommodate the needs of the employee to the point of undue hardship. While it is certainly open to the Respondent to warn employees returning to work after rehabilitation that any relapse could result in termination of there employment, the imposition of a last chance agreement cannot serve to nullify the duty of accommodation established under human rights legislation.\n[35] The Tribunal agrees that the concept of accommodation has its limits. This view was recently expressed by Madame Justice Heneghan of the Federal Court in City of Ottawa v. Desormeaux and City of Ottawa v. Parisien, [2004 FC 1778]. There, the Court endorsed what had been said by the Federal Court of Appeal on the issue of accommodation in relation to absenteeism in Scheuneman v. Canada (Attorney General), (2000) 266 N.R. 154 (F.C.A.), where leave to appeal to S.C.C. was refused, [2001] C.C.C.A. No. 9:\n( ) It is a basic requirement of the employment relationship that an employee must be able to undertake work for the employer or, if temporarily disabled by a medical condition from so doing, must be able to return to work within a reasonable period of time. Dismissing a person who cannot satisfy this requirement is not, in the constitutional sense, discrimination on the ground of disability.\"\nMadame Justice Heneghan went on to say that there comes a point when the employer can legitimately say that the bargain is not completely capable of performance.\n[36] Thus, as an employer, the Respondent is not subject to an endless rehabilitation process. It might well be that a second violation of the policy will entail the end of one's employment with the company. As stated earlier, this determination will have to be made on a case-by-case basis.\nV. CONCLUSION The Tribunal therefore finds:\nThat the definition of Safety-Sensitive Position which states that a Safety-Sensitive Position is as a position in which individuals have a key and direct role in an operation where performance limitations due to substance use could result in a significant incident or accident causing fatalities or serious injury, significant property damage or significant environmental damage. For the purposes of this policy, employees who are required to operate a motor vehicle in the care or control of the company, either as part of their regular duties or from time to time are considered to hold a Safety-Sensitive Position\", is in accordance with the Tribunal's initial ruling. Although the Tribunal feels that the Respondent might be justified in terminating an employee who has failed to rehabilitate himself\/herself, it is also of the opinion that every situations needs to be considered and justified on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, the Tribunal orders that the word may be substituted to the word will in Part IX of the Respondent's Alcohol and Drug Policy entitled Consequences of a Policy Violation.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps, Chair\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet, Member\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 28, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT713\/1802\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSalvatore Milazzo v.

They have requested direction from the Tribunal.\n[2] I think I have to start by saying, as a general rule, that an adjudicator should decline to elaborate on a legal decision. It merely complicates the matter. There may nevertheless be cases where it is helpful to clarify a particular point. This is one of those cases.\n[3] The factual issue between the parties is relatively simple. The Complainant submitted that he would have received a permanent position, if there had been a fair competition. In my decision on liability, I found that this theory of the case was not supported by the evidence. I nevertheless went on to find, in the absence of an explanation from the Respondent, that there was a discriminatory element in the competition. It does not follow that he would have received a permanent position.\n[4] In his written submissions, Mr. Bagambiire lists a number of considerations that militate in favour of a finding that Mr. Brooks would have received a permanent position. I found this recitation of the evidence selective, however. The most troubling fact is that it fails to recognize the simple poverty of the evidence. This is a product of the passage of time. Many of the documents relating to the competition have been destroyed and the record is incomplete. There is nothing like the information needed to form a reliable opinion as to what would have happened in a fair competition.\n[5] Mr. Brooks should appreciate that I am restricted to the evidence that was put before me. When I confine myself to this evidence, and avoid speculation, I am satisfied that he finished too far down the list for me to realistically find that he would have received a permanent position. The jurisprudence from the Tribunal and the Federal Court on the question of lost wages are of no assistance here. The evidence does not suggest, seriously or otherwise, that Mr. Brooks would have received a permanent position. It suggests that he would not have received such a position.\n[6] There is a statement in the written submissions that the evidence pointed to the fact that Richard Starr was an alcoholic. This goes to Mr. Starr's character rather than the merits of his participation in the competition. I think it is tinged with unfairness. It neglects the fact that Mr. Starr did not testify and had no opportunity to defend himself. The evidence was merely that other individuals, who finished behind him in the competition, felt that he had a drinking problem.\n[7] I see no reason to go into the deficiencies in the testimony of the Complainant. In the circumstances, however, I have to point out that he must take some of the blame for his poor relations with his employer. The reality is that he has stubbornly insisted on a permanent position, almost from the beginning of the long series of events that led to the complaint. He apparently refuses to accept any finding that goes against this cherished view.\n[8] The real unfairness in the case is that the winning candidates retained their permanent positions. From Mr. Brooks' perspective, the competition was fixed. And at the end of the day, Mr. Savoury simply got away with it. None of this establishes however that Mr. Brooks would have been entitled to a permanent position. It is simply too late to go back, 13 years later, and hold the competition again.\n[9] On the request for direction, I think the Tribunal has to send a clear message that it will not be swayed by the Complainant's rather stubborn refusal to accept its decision on liability. My position remains firmly as it was, and I am satisfied, on the evidence before me, that Mr. Brooks would not have received a permanent position. The facts have been decided; the finding has been made; and the doctrine of functus officio applies. There is nothing more for me to say on the matter.\n[10] I have already asked the parties to provide the Tribunal with an agenda of the issues that need to be canvassed when the hearing resumes.\nSigned by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 3, 2005\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT838\/8803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCecil Brooks v.

Hadjis\n2005 CHRT 7 2005\/02\/09\n[1] The Complainant has made a motion to amend the complaint that she originally filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on January 12, 2003. The Complainant alleges in her complaint that her employer, the Respondent, discriminated against her because of her marital status, contrary to s. 7 of the Act. The Complainant's spouse, who also worked for the Respondent, was dismissed in November 2001. Her spouse later filed judicial proceedings contesting his dismissal. The Complainant contends that on June 12, 2002, the Respondent reduced her seniority rights because her spouse had sued the Respondent. The Commission referred her complaint to the Tribunal on August 19, 2004.\n[2] On November 22, 2004, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal Registry requesting that her complaint be amended to include an allegation that the Respondent had retaliated against her, in breach of s. 14.1 of the Act. She explained in her letter that since 2003, she has filed several complaints with the Respondent regarding a number of employment-related matters. She claims that the Respondent chose to not address any of these concerns, in reprisal against her for having filed a human rights complaint.\n[3] On November 12, 2004, the Respondent dismissed the Complainant from her job. She alleges that she was fired in retaliation to her human rights complaint, noting that the Respondent's decision occurred only a few months after the Commission had referred her complaint to the Tribunal.\n[4] The dismissal came shortly after the Complainant registered a protest with the Respondent, on October 25, 2004, concerning alleged misconduct by several other employees. The Respondent stated in its notice of dismissal to the Complainant that her accusations had been proven unfounded and defamatory, and were made with the sole intention of discrediting the employees in question. The Respondent deemed this conduct to be unacceptable and dismissed the Complainant without any further notice or delay.\n[5] The Respondent contests the motion to amend the human rights complaint. The Respondent claims that the Complainant's new allegations are unfounded and that in any event, the question of the Complainant's dismissal is entirely unrelated to the human rights complaint. She was fired, it is argued, not because of her complaint but because she had been propagating defamatory comments about other employees within the workplace. The Complainant contends that this explanation is merely a pretext, put forth so as to camouflage the Respondent's true intention: to free itself from the Complainant and her human rights complaint by dismissing her outright.\n[6] As was pointed out in Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 at para. 16, when assessing whether to grant a motion to amend a complaint, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the amendment. This should only be done in the fullness of the evidence after a full hearing. An amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations set out therein could not possibly succeed.\n[7] In the present case, it is not plain and obvious to me that the Complainant would be unable to establish that her dismissal was made in retaliation to her human rights complaint. Based on the allegations as presented, there is nothing to preclude the possibility of her demonstrating that retaliation constituted at least one of the factors in her dismissal.\n[8] The Respondent disputes the Complainant's contention that the concerns she had raised prior to her dismissal were never addressed. The Respondent claims that to the contrary, many of these questions were dealt with either through the grievance process or by other means. The Respondent can certainly raise these points before the Tribunal inquiring into the merits of the human rights complaint, but they do not make it plain and obvious that the Complainant's amended allegations will not be substantiated.\n[9] Similarly, the Respondent noted in its written submissions that a grievance has been filed on behalf of the Complainant contesting her dismissal, the outcome of which will determine if her dismissal was wrongful. The Respondent seemed to imply that all of the Complainant's concerns would be addressed in this fashion. However, it is far from certain that the grievance adjudicator will be making any findings as to whether s. 14.1 of the Act was infringed. It is not therefore plain and obvious that the Complainant will be prevented from establishing before the Tribunal that her allegations of reprisal are well founded.\n[10] In its submissions, the Respondent referred to the Tribunal decision in Uzoaba v. Canada (Correctional Service) (1994), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/361 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd (1995), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/428 (F.C.T.D.). In that case, the Commission attempted to adduce evidence that dated as far back as twenty years prior to the date of the human rights complaint, and which related to incidents not specifically referred to in the complaint. The Tribunal concluded that given the passage of time and the understandably hazy recollection by witnesses of the events in question, it would have been unfair to admit this evidence. The Respondent argues that it would be similarly unfairly prejudiced if the scope of the present case was extended to include the allegations of retaliation.\n[11] I am not persuaded by this argument. The situation in the present case is not in any way analogous to that described in Uzoaba. All of the incidents of retaliation alleged in the Complainant's amendment occurred after the filing of the complaint and if anything, witnesses will find it easier recalling these events than those relating to the existing complaint. Moreover, the matter at hand does not so much consist of enlarging the scope of the case, but rather including an additional allegation of discrimination that by definition is directly related to the existing human rights complaint. As was noted in Bressette, individuals should not be compelled to make allegations of reprisal or retaliation arising after a complaint, by way of separate proceedings. It just makes common sense for all these allegations to come before the Tribunal at the same time.\n[12] Furthermore, the progress of this case from referral to hearing is still in its early stages. The parties have yet to exchange their Statements of Particulars and provide disclosure, in accordance with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, nor has the date for the hearing itself been set. Consequently, I am satisfied that the Respondent will have adequate notice of the case it must meet and will not be prejudiced unfairly if the amendment is granted.\n[13] The Complainant's motion to amend her original complaint to include an allegation of retaliation pursuant to s.14.1 of the Act is therefore granted.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Mr. Bruce J. Tweten, began working for the respondent, RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. (RTL) as of November 13, 1995. He began as an apprentice \/ journeyman. He left RTL for a period of time and was rehired as a heavy duty mechanic from June 13, 1996.\n[2] RTL operates a trucking business and has its head office in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. RTL has a branch office in Edmonton, Alberta with a trucking division that collects, loads and hauls freight. The Edmonton office includes a mechanical repair division where Mr. Tweten repaired heavy duty equipment.\n[3] Unfortunately, while working at RTL, Mr. Tweten injured his back.\nII. DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT - AUGUST 25, 1997 [4] Mr. Tweten injured his back while working on a trailer on August 25, 1997. He began to experience back pain. Mr. Tweten saw his physician, Dr. Seto, the following day. He then made a workers' compensation board (WCB) claim. This claim was accepted by the WCB on the basis of his back injury, and he began receiving WCB compensation benefits as of August 26, 1997.\n[5] Mr. Tweten then attended at a rehabilitation center and was assessed by an Orthopaedic Specialist. In November 14, 1997 WCB determined that Mr. Tweten was capable of modified work and advised Mr. Art Brochu of the same in responding to RTL's concerns pertaining to employer contributions. WCB did not provide Mr. Brochu with further details regarding Mr. Tweten's condition. This letter does not outline his limitations or capabilities or alternate or modified work duties.\n[6] In accordance with its assessment, WCB terminated Mr. Tweten's benefits as of December 17, 1997. The WCB case manager felt that his complaints of pain were subjective and that WCB could not offer him further treatment to assist his injury, as he had taken two rehabilitation programs without success. Mr. Tweten challenged this decision and was eventually successful in having WCB benefits re-instated from December 18, 1997 to July 2, 1999.\n[7] Mr. Tweten alleges that when his WCB benefits were terminated he could lift a maximum weight of 50 pounds. He alleges that he advised RTL of this restriction and that he asked Art Brochu for light duty work. He alleges that RTL denied this request and would only allow him to recommence work if he was at 100% physical ability and could perform 100% of his work duties. He alleges that RTL categorically denied him modified work, and instead terminated his employment.\nIII. FACTS [8] In December 1997, after WCB advised Mr. Tweten that his benefits would be terminating, Mr. Tweten contacted Mr. Brochu asking for light duties to return to work. Mr. Brochu advised him that there did not exist a light duty program for a heavy duty mechanic. Mr. Brochu told him that he required a letter from his doctor outlining his physical limitations and what work he could perform without re-injuring himself. Mr. Brochu told him that after receipt of the letter he would determine if RTL could modify a work program for him. Mr. Tweten never provided such a letter to RTL. Nor did he specify to Mr. Brochu that he was capable of lifting a maximum of 50 pounds of weight.\n[9] Mr. Tweten was unhappy with this proposal and filed an application for long term disability (LTD) benefits on January 26, 1998 with UNUM Canada. He asked RTL for the necessary paperwork to complete this LTD claim and RTL cooperated with him in supplying requested information and forms to UNUM Canada. Mr. Tweten had received interim benefits from UNUM Canada from August 26, 1997 to December 24, 1997. Thereafter, UNUM Canada refused to provide him with further benefits on the basis that he had not demonstrated that he was incapable of performing each of the material duties of his occupation during that 120-day elimination period.\n[10] Meanwhile, on February 6, 1998, Mr. Brochu telephoned Mr. Tweten and asked him to come to his office to discuss what might constitute light duty work for a heavy duty mechanic. Mr. Tweten was defensive and refused to cooperate with him. Mr. Brochu asked him to return the company key still in his possession. Mr. Tweten indicated that he would have his father return the key on February 16, 1998.\n[11] On February 13, 1998, Mr. Brochu was in Calmar, Alberta where Mr. Tweten resided. He telephoned him and asked him to meet him for a coffee. Mr. Tweten refused to meet him or to return the key. Mr. Tweten provided the key to the RCMP and told the RCMP to advise RTL that he did not want to hear from RTL again unless it was in writing.\n[12] After this incident, and in light of the fact that Mr. Tweten had collected his tools from RTL work site at night in January 1998, RTL evaluated Mr. Tweten's actions as being tantamount to Mr. Tweten having quit his employ. RTL thereafter completed a record of employment that Mr. Tweten was no longer employed with RTL as of September 1, 1997.\n[13] In short, Mr. Brochu repeatedly asked Mr. Tweten for a medical opinion from his doctor indicating specifically what type of work Mr. Tweten was capable of doing. Thereafter, he was going to determine what, if any, accommodation RTL could make for Mr. Tweten. In spite of numerous requests for such a letter, Mr. Tweten at no time provided Mr. Brochu or anyone at RTL with a medical letter or other information outlining his limitations.\n[14] While Mr. Tweten had provided RTL's agent with a release to access his WCB files this was used by RTL only to address cost recovery issues before the WCB Board and Appeal Commission and not to vet his file for medical information about his limitations. The release specifically states that RTL's agent company may access the file to represent RTL's interests for this stated purpose. RTL had not sought the release for other purposes; nor did it have access to the WCB file for other purposes.\nIV. BASIS OF MY FACTUAL FINDINGS [15] The bases for my factual findings are outlined below.\nA. LAY WITNESSES [16] As the events occurred many years ago, and because there is a conflict between the oral testimonies of the witnesses, I place more weight on the letter of February 18, 1998 from Art Brochu to Christine Papenhuyzen.1 This letter was copied to Mr. Tweten; yet, he failed to dispute its contents in writing at the time. I find that this letter contains the best evidence of the events that transpired at the material time. As well, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of Mr. Tweten and that of Mr. Art Brochu, a former employee of RTL who worked as a safety manager at the relevant times, I prefer the testimony of the latter RTL witness. I find Mr. Brochu to be a candid and direct witness. I find him to have acted reasonably in his dealings with Mr. Tweten both prior to and following the August 1997 back injury. After the injury and the termination of the WCB benefits he did not advise Mr. Tweten that he could not return to work. To the contrary he tried to meet with him to discuss the situation. Further, he does not currently work for RTL and provided an independent recollection of the events that had transpired. As well, his testimony remained consistent throughout his testimony in chief and under cross-examination.\n[17] On the other hand, I do not find the oral testimony of Mr. Tweten reliable given a number of factors. First, he had a more partisan interest in the complaint. He was defensive and had limited memory of the relevant events. His testimony was not logical in material areas: for example he testified that he asked Dr. Seto for a letter outlining his limitations (contrary to the testimony and notes of Dr. Seto) yet did not satisfactorily explain why he never provided such a letter to RTL. Another example is that he testified that he did not understand why he had to return the company's keys to RTL after a 6 month absence. Nor did he provide a logical explanation for why he only recorded selected conversations between himself and Mr. Brochu.\nB. TAPED TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS [18] Mr. Tweten selectively taped some telephone conversations between himself and Mr. Brochu from January 14, 1998 to February 2, 1998 and filed the transcripts as exhibits. I find that these conversations were deliberately calculated by Mr. Tweten to elicit a specific response by Mr. Brochu: Mr. Tweten wished to tape a statement by Mr. Brochu that he required Mr. Tweten to be capable of 100% of his job duties prior to return to work. I note that in spite of such a statement, Mr. Brochu confirms that he requires a slip from Mr. Tweten's doctor stating that he was fit to return to work. I do not find these conversations helpful and I place no weight on them.\nC. DR. SETO [19] I have serious reservations about the independence of Dr. Seto. At least one of Dr. Seto's medical legal reports refers to items that are not documented in his chart notes. Although I directed him to bring his original chart to the hearing so that RTL's counsel could review it, Dr. Seto did not cooperate with this direction. Eventually, he advised the panel that he could not locate the file and thus avoided producing the same for examination by RTL's counsel. Dr. Seto testified to events that were not documented in his notes. He contradicted himself on several occasions. Overall, I found him evasive and unreliable. Even Mr. Tweten acknowledged that Dr. Seto was open to suggestion and agreed that I could not place any weight on his testimony.2 Further, I place no weight on his chart and question its authenticity and reliability.\nV. ISSUES [20] Based upon my findings of fact I now address the legal issues that arise.\n[21] The jurisdiction of this Tribunal arises from Mr. Tweten's complaint dated September 9, 1998. The crux of Mr. Tweten's complaint centres on the factual determination of whether or not RTL refused to accommodate his back injury.\n[22] The issues are:\nDid RTL discriminate against Mr. Tweten contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act?3 If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, has RTL established a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) defence further to s. 15(a) of the Act? Did RTL refuse to accommodate him as required by law? If RTL was in breach of its duty of accommodation, what remedies should be awarded to Mr. Tweten?\nVI. LAW A. HUMAN RIGHTS LAW [23] Mr. Tweten filed a complaint pursuant to s. 7 of the Act as it stood on September 9, 1998, complaining about events that occurred in the latter portion of 1997. Section 7 of the current Act states that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of employment. One of the prohibited grounds is disability.\nSection 15(1)(a) outlines the bona fide occupational requirement defence:\nIt is not a discriminatory practice if any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\nSection 15(2) states:\nFor any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nSection 15(8) confirms that section 15 applies to both direct and adverse effect discrimination.\n[24] The Act as it stood at the time of the alleged discrimination, did not contain provisions equivalent to the current section 15(2), 15(8) and 15(9). These amendments came into force and effect as of June 30, 1998.4\n[25] In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Services Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [Grismer]. In these two cases, the Supreme Court of Canada replaced the former jurisprudential distinction between direct and indirect discrimination with a unified approach. Under the unified approach, the onus remains upon the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is sufficient and complete to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established by the complainant, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the discriminatory standard or policy is a BFOR. In order to establish a BFOR, the respondent must prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function being performed. At this stage, the focus is not on the validity of the particular standard, but on the more general purpose, such as the need to work safely and efficiently to perform the job. Where the general purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the job, it will not be necessary to spend much time at this stage; it adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. Here, the analysis shifts from the general purpose of the standard, to the standard itself; and the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose; i.e. the safe and efficient job performance. The employer must establish that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. The employer must ensure that the procedure, if any, to assess the issue of accommodation, addresses the possibility that it might discriminate unnecessarily on a prohibited ground. As well the substantive content of a more accommodating standard offered by the employer must be individually sensitive. Alternatively, the employer must justify his reason for not offering such an alternative standard.\n[26] The Supreme Court's rulings in Meiorin and Grismer are also instructive in assessing whether or not an undue hardship defence has been established. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court observed that the use of the word `undue' implies that some hardship is acceptable; it is only `undue' hardship that will satisfy the test.5 An uncompromisingly stringent standard may be ideal from the employer's perspective. Yet, if it is to be justified under human rights legislation, the standard must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship. The Supreme Court has further observed that in order to prove that a standard is reasonably necessary, a respondent always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship.\n[27] In some cases, excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities. However, one must be wary of putting too low a value on accommodation. It is all too easy to cite increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord equal treatment. The adoption of the respondent's standard has to be supported by convincing evidence. Impressionistic evidence of increased cost will not generally suffice.6 Innovative and practical non-monetary avenues of accommodation ought to be considered. Finally, factors such as the financial cost of methods of accommodation should be applied with common sense and flexibility in the context of the factual situation under consideration.7 As observed by Cory J. in Chambly v. Bergevin [1994] 2 SCR 525, what may be entirely reasonable in prosperous times may impose an unreasonable financial burden on an employer in times of economic restraint or recession. I note that the term `undue hardship' is not currently defined in the Act. Finally, employees have a duty to assist in securing appropriate accommodation and to facilitate the search for accommodation.8 In Butler v. Nenqayni Treatment Centre Society [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 25, the former Chair of this Tribunal, as she then was, ruled that the failure of the complainant to provide the respondent with requested medical information regarding her physical limitations constituted a breach by the complainant of her duty to facilitate the search for accommodation. In short, the quest for accommodation requires give and take by all parties involved in the process. It is a two-way street.\n[28] In returning to the threshold question of determining whether the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, this Tribunal is to conduct an inquiry into the complaint further to ss. 49 and 50. This inquiry is to be independent, impartial and have due regard to the evidence presented and the relevant law. This Tribunal is bound by the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling in Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) (C.A.) (2003), 4 F.C. 580. The court confirmed that both Meiorin and Grismer considered the effects of discrete, explicit standards or policies which served as screening tools; i.e., an aerobic capacity standard that adversely discriminated against women, and a visual acuity standard for the issuance of driver's licenses, constituting direct discrimination. The Federal Court of Appeal distinguished those cases from a transaction between the parties that was not driven by a pre-existing policy. Instead, there was a course of dealings in which the parties operated from an understanding of their respective rights and obligations. In Hutchinson, it was difficult to isolate and identify a particular policy or standard. In Meiorin, the Court's analysis began from a finding that the policy in question distinguished between people adversely on a prohibited ground. The Federal Court ruled that where one is dealing with a course of conduct, the more appropriate question is, does the transaction between the parties, taken as a whole, result in adverse treatment on a prohibited ground? If the transaction taken as a whole does not disclose adverse treatment, then the inquiry is at an end. If adverse treatment on a prohibited ground is shown, one proceeds to the three questions envisioned by the Supreme Court's analysis in Meiorin. In Hutchinson, the Court ruled that it was reasonably open to the Commission to find that the transaction between the appellant and the respondent, taken as a whole, did not disclose adverse treatment.\n[29] Further, in Hutchinson the Court affirmed that a complainant does not have the right to hold out for his or her preferred alternative. In that case, the respondent did attempt to accommodate the complainant's disability by moving her to alternate work sites, employing her on a seasonal basis, promoting a scent free environment and offering telework. The Federal Court adopted the ruling in Ontario (Ministry of Community and Social Services) v. OPSEU (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 560, where the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the employer's Religious Observance Policy was sufficient to accommodate the individual needs of adherents of minority religions. An employee claimed the right to paid time off to observe eleven religious holidays. The employer's policy provided for two paid days off for religious observance and allowed for additional days off to be taken via scheduling changes and earned days off accumulated through the employer's compressed workweek option. The employee took the position that his earned days off from the compressed work week were his to use as he saw fit and that the employer could give him 11 paid days off for religious observance without undue hardship. The Court held that since the employer's policy was sufficiently inclusive to accommodate the claimant, the issue of accommodation to the point of undue hardship did not arise. The Federal Court ruled that one of the corollaries of this position is that claimants cannot refuse a reasonable solution on the ground that the alternative, which they favour, will not cause the employer undue hardship.\nVII. ANALYSIS A. PRIMA FACIE CASE NOT ESTABLISHED & BREACH OF DUTY BY COMPLAINANT TO FACILITATE ACCOMMODATION [30] In this case, the transaction as a whole that occurred between Mr. Tweten and RTL did not constitute adverse treatment by RTL against Mr. Tweten. RTL acknowledged Mr. Tweten's disability and diligently sought to meet with him to discuss accommodation. Mr. Tweten refused to facilitate such a meeting and failed to provide RTL with requested medical information about his limitations.\n[31] Specifically, with respect to s. 7(a) of the Act, Mr. Tweten had a back injury and thus he had a disability within the meaning of the Act. However, RTL did not refuse to employ him due to the injury. Rather, Mr. Tweten voluntarily chose to leave RTL. He failed to communicate with RTL about a return to work. He failed to report to work in December 1997 or thereafter and collected his tools in January 1998.\n[32] Neither did RTL contravene s. 7(b) of the Act. RTL did not differentiate adversely against Mr. Tweten. Rather RTL cooperated with Mr. Tweten by keeping his position open for him pending his return to work after his injury, and by assisting him with the long term disability forms. As well, RTL tried to meet with him repeatedly without success to discuss the status of his employment and return to work but Mr. Tweten refused to meet with Mr. Brochu.\n[33] Thus, the complainant has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of either section 7(a) or section 7(b) of the Act.\n[34] Finally, even if RTL had discriminated against Mr. Tweten, as discussed, RTL made every effort to meet with Mr. Tweten to discuss his need for accommodation, even after Mr. Tweten failed to provide it with a letter outlining his physical limitations. In failing to respond to this legitimate request from RTL, Mr. Tweten breached his duty to facilitate the search for meaningful accommodation. RTL's conduct was bona fide throughout. In the circumstances of this case, I do not find that the WCB release entitled RTL or its agent unlimited access to Mr. Tweten's file. Mr. Tweten argues that under the former s. 141 of the Workers' Compensation Act of Alberta, RTL was entitled to access his medical file. This section clearly limits the employer's access to information that is relevant to an issue under review or appeal and confines the Workers' Compensation Board's right to release information to an employer to issues pertaining to the same. The issues of an employee's needs for workplace accommodation do not fall within the scope of this section and the statutory scheme contemplated in that legislation. As well, it is not reasonable in the circumstances of this case to require RTL to write to WCB to vet its files to determine Mr. Tweten's limitations. Mr. Brochu made a bona fide effort to obtain the required medical information directly from Mr. Tweten. All Mr. Tweten had to do was to obtain his own physician's statement outlining his limitations. Even after Mr. Tweten's failure to provide such a letter, Mr. Brochu, in good faith, made numerous efforts to meet with him to discuss his job and what accommodation he sought. This is not a case wherein Mr. Tweten suffered from a mental disability that prevented him from cooperating in the search for accommodation. Mr. Tweten failed absolutely to contribute to the multi-party task of finding meaningful accommodation. He failed to walk at all on a two-way street.\n[35] Thus, I dismiss Mr. Tweten's claim in its entirety.\nSigned by Shirish P.

Grant Sinclair Pierre Deschamps\n2005 CHRT 9 2005\/02\/11\n[1] CEP intends to call seven witnesses in support of its claim for pain and suffering pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Bell Canada requests that the Tribunal issue an order compelling these witnesses to disclose their medical records covering the period of 1990 to 2004.\n[2] The medical records that Bell seeks include all clinical notes and reports made by any attending physician, psychiatrist or other health professional and all OHIP or RAMQ records pertaining to each of them. Bell seeks also any medical records which are in the possession or custody of any hospital or other health care institution, including all clinical notes and reports made by any physician, psychiatrist or other health professional employed by, or on the staff of, such hospital or other health care institution for the period and all OHIP or RAMQ records in the possession or custody of such hospital or other health care institution.\n[3] \u0399n its November 20, 2003 letter sent to Bell, CEP states that the witnesses who will be called will give evidence about the emotional, psychological and financial impact on them of Bell's failure to implement the results of the Joint Study. In a subsequent letter dated October 1, 2004, CEP adds that these witnesses will generally provide evidence in respect of injury to dignity and self-respect, financial hardship, stress and frustration caused to them and other bargaining unit members as a result of the discrimination they have experienced.\n[4] Bell argues that, in making a claim for pain and suffering, these witnesses have necessarily put their respective medical conditions in issue and must disclose their medical records.\n[5] CEP resists Bell's request arguing that a claim for compensation for pain and suffering does not necessarily involve an individual's medical condition and does not give an automatic right to the disclosure of medical records. CEP states that it has no intention of leading medical evidence in support of its claim for pain and suffering. Its witnesses will not allege that they sought any medical attention because of discrimination. And Bell's request is an unnecessary intrusion into their private lives.\n[6] The Canadian Human Rights Commission also opposes Bell's motion. It adopts in their entirety CEP's submissions.\n[7] In support of its request, Bell relies mainly on the decision of this Tribunal in McAvinn. V. Straight Crossing Bridge Ltd., unreported, January 3, 2001, (T-558\/1600), (CHRT). Bell counsels also referred the Tribunal to Hay v. University of Alberta Hospital, (1990) 69 D.L.R. (4th) 755, Frenette v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 647 and A. (M.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157.\n[8] In support of its arguments, CEP relies essentially on the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ryan.\n[9] We do not agree that a claim for pain and suffering necessarily puts medical conditions in issue and calls for the production of medical records.\n[10] This Tribunal has awarded compensation for pain an suffering without having heard medical evidence nor ordered the disclosure of medical records (Druken et al. v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, 8 C.H.R.R. D 4379, Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, 2003\/05\/09, Vlug v. CBC, T.D. 6\/00, 2000\/11\/15, Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 21, 2003\/06\/05). Tribunals and Courts often rely on a person's testimony as well as the whole of the evidence to make an award for pain and suffering.\n[11] That is not to say that an individual's medical condition and medical records will never be relevant to a claim for pain and suffering. Cases such as McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd, 2001\/11\/15 (CHRT) illustrate that possibility.\n[12] In McAvinn, the complainant clearly made her medical condition an issue when she testified that she had sought medical care in relation to the anxiety she had experienced because of the alleged discrimination.\n[13] At this stage of the proceedings, unlike in McAvinn, the Tribunal has no evidence that the witnesses CEP intends to call ever sought medical care in relation to pain and suffering. In fact, CEP has clearly taken the position that these witnesses will not be alleging that they received medical attention because of Bell's alleged discrimination.\n[14] CEP's two letters, however, show that the witnesses to be called intend to give evidence about the emotional, psychological and financial impact of Bell's failure to abide by the results of the Joint Study (CEP's November 23, 2003 letter), and propose to give evidence in respect of injury to dignity and self-respect, financial hardship, stress and frustration caused to them and other bargaining unit members (CEP's October 1, 2004 letter).\n[15] In our opinion, it is not apparent that the medical records of the individuals who will be called to testify would yield any relevant information as to the financial hardship that these individuals might have experienced in relation to Bell's conduct. The same can be said with respect to frustration and injury to dignity and self-respect.\n[16] The emotional and psychological impact of Bell's conduct on these witnesses and the stress they might have experienced due to Bell's conduct is more problematic. As to this impact, their medical records may or may not be useful to Bell's defense. Indeed, Bell may best achieve its goals through cross-examination rather than by disclosure of medical records, with the attendant intrusion into the privacy of the witnesses.\n[17] The Tribunal is not in a position at this time to make any ruling as to the disclosure of medical records as they relate to psychological and emotional impact or stress. Any decision will, if necessary, be made in the context of the evidence of each witness and how that evidence unfolds.\nSigned by J.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Aleta Gaucher a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en 1998 dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue avoir fait l'objet de discrimination en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. La Commission pr\u00e9sente maintenant une requ\u00eate en vue de modifier la plainte. La plaignante appuie la modification.\n[2] Les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par la Commission ne sont pas compl\u00e8tement clairs. Selon ce que je comprends, la demande vise simplement \u00e0 ajouter la mention de l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dans la clause d'all\u00e9gation de la plainte, clause qui serait alors r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJ'ai fait l'objet de la part des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille et l'\u00e2ge du fait d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e, de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 promue et de ne pas avoir continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre employ\u00e9e en contravention de l'article 7 [et de l'article 10] de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nJe demanderais que la Commission d\u00e9pose \u00e0 l'avenir un avis de requ\u00eate incluant une annexe contenant le libell\u00e9 exact de la modification propos\u00e9e. Cette pratique serait conforme au paragraphe 3(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\nA. La position de la Commission [3] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que la plainte est fond\u00e9e sur des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les politiques d'emploi des Forces canadiennes pratiquent syst\u00e9matiquement de la discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit des femmes, des femmes autochtones et des m\u00e8res c\u00e9libataires. Au paragraphe 26 de ses observations \u00e9crites, la Commission d\u00e9clare que l'attention de l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 attir\u00e9e sur cette situation de diverses fa\u00e7ons, tant dans l'instance devant la Commission que dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[TRADUCTION]\n26. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la nature syst\u00e9mique de la plainte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire de la plainte au moyen de l'affidavit de la plaignante dans sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de m\u00eame qu'au cours de toute l'enqu\u00eate et de l'enqu\u00eate additionnelle de la Commission.\nLes observations \u00e9crites renvoient \u00e0 de nombreux passages des documents actuels qui mentionnent la nature syst\u00e9mique de la plainte.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve une objection en affirmant que la plupart de ces passages sont extraits de l'affidavit qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Malgr\u00e9 cela, il est \u00e9vident que l'enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte \u00e0 nouveau, \u00e0 une \u00e9tape relativement tardive, pour recueillir les renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 cinq employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin qui ont soi-disant \u00e9t\u00e9 promus avant la plaignante. C'est ce qui semblerait \u00eatre le point de d\u00e9part de toute instruction sur les aspects syst\u00e9miques de la plainte. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait apparemment d'avis qu'elle ne pouvait pas fournir ces renseignements suivant la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00e0 moins d'avoir une assignation ou un mandat.\n[5] Je pense que le facteur le plus important se trouve dans le processus de preuve. Je fais cette affirmation parce que la Commission soutient qu'il est difficile, voire impossible, de faire une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte de Mme Gaucher sans examiner de nombreuses questions syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du lieu de travail. Il s'agit d'une partie in\u00e9vitable de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne et c'est fr\u00e9quemment le cas dans ces affaires soumises au tribunal. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que la Commission a le droit de d\u00e9poser comme preuve circonstancielle de la preuve institutionnelle et syst\u00e9mique qui peut aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'un plaignant a fait l'objet de discrimination.\nB. La position de l'intim\u00e9e [6] L'intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 la demande. Elle pr\u00e9tend que la modification [TRADUCTION] modifierait de fa\u00e7on importante la nature de la plainte et prolongerait [TRADUCTION] la r\u00e9solution d\u00e9finitive de cette plainte. Elle pr\u00e9tend essentiellement que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. Le Tribunal ne peut instruire une plainte \u00e0 moins qu'elle ait suivi le processus pr\u00e9vu par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9e cite l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel de Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse IMP Group Limited c. Dillman [1995] N.S.J. no 326 (QL), au paragraphe 37, dans lequel la cour d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION] Ainsi que le dit l'avocat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il ne s'est pas simplement agi d'une extension, \u00e9laboration ou clarification de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel d\u00e9j\u00e0 devant la commission d'enqu\u00eate. Soulever une nouvelle plainte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience contournerait tout le processus l\u00e9gislatif qui est structur\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre des tentatives de conciliation et de r\u00e8glement. Cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet des \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9liminaires d'enqu\u00eate, de conciliation et de renvoi par la Commission pour faire instruire la plainte en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 32a) de la Loi. La commission d'enqu\u00eate a trait\u00e9 d'une question dont elle n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie.\nL'intim\u00e9e cite en outre ma propre d\u00e9cision dans Cook c. Onion Lake First Nation, TCDP 2002\/04\/22, dans laquelle j'ai \u00e9crit qu'il existe un point o\u00f9 une modification introduit fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte.\n[8] J'ai naturellement la m\u00eame opinion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces d\u00e9clarations de droit. Le fond de la plainte doit suivre le processus de renvoi. La Commission ne peut pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle plainte apr\u00e8s le renvoi, sous le pr\u00e9texte d'une modification, et contourner son propre processus de renvoi. La situation \u00e9tait cependant plut\u00f4t diff\u00e9rente dans l'arr\u00eat Dillman, dans lequel la modification se rapportait \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de faits qui n'\u00e9taient pas inclus dans la plainte initiale. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il existe des cas qui semblent plus pr\u00e8s de la situation qui m'est soumise. Dans la d\u00e9cision Woiden c. Lynn, TCDP 2002\/01\/23, par exemple, le membre instructeur a permis que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e pour inclure une mention \u00e0 un article additionnel de la Loi parce que les faits dont le Tribunal disposait resteraient les m\u00eames.\nII. ANALYSE [9] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne vient du fait que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte. Cela donne le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans lequel toute demande de modification doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. La Commission, lorsqu'elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, doit avoir examin\u00e9 la situation essentielle qui constitue le sujet de l'affaire \u00e0 instruire. Cela cr\u00e9e certaines limites \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des modifications qui doivent avoir leur historique dans les circonstances soumises \u00e0 la Commission.\n[10] Ce n'est toutefois qu'un aspect de l'affaire. Je pense qu'il faut \u00eatre conscient de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la situation lors de l'examen d'une demande de modification. Le formulaire de plainte existe principalement pour les besoins de la Commission. Il est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire qui soul\u00e8ve une s\u00e9rie de faits qui requi\u00e8rent une enqu\u00eate plus \u00e0 fond. Le formulaire de plainte fournit un point de d\u00e9part important et il est approximatif en soi. Il n'a jamais eu pour but de servir aux fins d'une plaidoirie dans un processus adjudicatif qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une audience. Ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, plut\u00f4t que la plainte initiale, qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l'audience.\n[11] Les parties doivent \u00eatre conscientes qu'il n'y a rien d'inhabituel dans la demande d'une modification. Les formulaires soumis au Tribunal sont habituellement remplis avant que la plainte ait \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement examin\u00e9e et que tous les faits pertinents soient expos\u00e9s. Il est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient souvent r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au cours de l'enqu\u00eate. Il s'ensuit que les plaintes sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fond de la plainte initiale est respect\u00e9, je ne vois pas pourquoi la plaignante et la Commission ne devraient pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 clarifier et \u00e0 expliquer les all\u00e9gations initiales avant la tenue d'une audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affaire.\n[12] Je pense que les tribunaux qui traitent des droits de la personne ont adopt\u00e9 une d\u00e9marche lib\u00e9rale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des modifications. Ce choix est conforme \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui est une loi r\u00e9paratrice. Elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9troite ou technique. Dans l'arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 A.C.S. no 75 (QL), au paragraphe 50, par exemple, la Cour supr\u00eame a approuv\u00e9 une modification \u00e0 une plainte qui a simplement rendu la plainte conforme aux proc\u00e9dures. Je pense que la situation qui m'est soumise est similaire. Il s'agit simplement de s'assurer que la forme de la plainte refl\u00e8te avec pr\u00e9cision le fond des all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal.\n[13] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement souscrit \u00e0 cette d\u00e9marche. Dans la d\u00e9cision La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et al. c. Bell Canada, 2002 CFPI 776, au paragraphe 31, M. le juge Kelen sugg\u00e8re que la r\u00e8gle devant le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devrait \u00eatre la m\u00eame. La jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne :\n[...] est reprise dans les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale quant aux modifications de plaidoirie selon la r\u00e8gle 75 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (1998). Je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Rolls Royce plc c. Fitzwilliam (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (C.F. 1re inst.), dans lequel le juge Blanchard a \u00e9tabli, en tant que r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que les modifications propos\u00e9es soient autoris\u00e9es lorsque la partie adverse ne subit aucun pr\u00e9judice [...]\nLe juge Kelen cite ensuite l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada, [1994] 1 C.F. 3 (C.A.F.), \u00e0 la page 10, au m\u00eame effet. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles peuvent se retrouver dans les all\u00e9gations et les faits soumis \u00e0 la Commission et o\u00f9 elles ne portent pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, les modifications devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es. Cela aide toutes les parties \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties.\n[14] Selon moi, la Commission veut simplement, avant l'audience, clarifier la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la situation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que toutes les parties soient inform\u00e9es que la plainte soul\u00e8ve des questions syst\u00e9miques plus profondes. Il s'agit d'une mesure louable. Il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'\u00eatre explicite. Je n'accepte pas la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9crit la demande de modification, soit comme une demande visant \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 l'instruction une nouvelle plainte de nature syst\u00e9mique. La chose ou la responsabilit\u00e9 ou le d\u00e9lit soumis au Tribunal demeurera le m\u00eame qu'avant qu'une modification ait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e. Le fond de la plainte demeurera le m\u00eame qu'avant qu'une modification ait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e.\n[15] Je dois ajouter que je pense que la Commission pourrait agir sans une modification. Les dispositions de l'article 53 qui traitent de redressement ne font pas de distinction entre les aspects personnels et les aspects syst\u00e9miques d'une plainte et c'est une erreur que de faire une certaine dichotomie stricte entre les plaintes suivant l'article 7 et celles suivant l'article 10. La Loi est r\u00e9paratrice et requiert une conception organique plus large. Comme r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal est tenu de suivre le fond de la plainte, peu importe o\u00f9 il conduit. La question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9paration est simplement celle de savoir si l'action r\u00e9paratrice que la Commission demande r\u00e9sulte naturellement des all\u00e9gations soumises au Tribunal. Cela est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9tabli par les faits de l'affaire plut\u00f4t que par l'article en vertu duquel la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[16] L'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Robinson, [1994] 3 C.F. (C.A.F.) 228, \u00e0 la page 248, appuierait, du moins implicitement, la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle l'\u00e9tendue du pouvoir r\u00e9parateur exerc\u00e9 par le Tribunal est \u00e9tablie par les dispositions de l'article 53, comme je l'ai sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que par l'article en vertu duquel la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Il s'ensuit que des redressements syst\u00e9miques sont offerts si la plainte, l'enqu\u00eate qui en r\u00e9sulte et le processus de divulgation devant le Tribunal montrent qu'ils sont appropri\u00e9s. Si la source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e suivant l'article 7 se trouve dans le processus de promotions, je pense que le Tribunal a l'obligation d'examiner ce processus.\n[17] Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s. Il s'ensuit que toutes les questions se rapportant \u00e0 la preuve que la Commission souhaite pr\u00e9senter et que le redressement pr\u00e9cis qu'elle tente d'obtenir devront \u00eatre trait\u00e9s un autre jour. D'un point de vue pratique, cependant, on doit se demander comment il est possible de tenir une instruction \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus de promotions quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il touche la plaignante sans examiner le processus de promotions de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Si la preuve \u00e9tablit qu'il existe des failles dans ce processus, il m'appara\u00eet que la Commission a le droit de faire corriger le processus en vertu de l'article 53 de la Loi. C'est clairement ce que la Loi envisage.\n[18] La v\u00e9ritable question dans une affaire comme celle qui m'est soumise est celle de savoir si la modification est pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Cette situation n\u00e9cessite un exercice de jugement plut\u00f4t qu'une analyse logique ou linguistique de la plainte originale. La question est celle de savoir si la modification propos\u00e9e mine s\u00e9rieusement l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus. Le principe de base est assez simple. Si une modification propos\u00e9e ouvre une nouvelle voie non pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une instruction, elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e. La question pratique est habituellement celle de savoir si l'avis qu'a re\u00e7u l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait suffisant pour respecter les exigences de justice naturelle.\n[19] Je ne vois rien dans la modification demand\u00e9e par la Commission qui soit pr\u00e9judiciable dans ce sens. La modification est par cons\u00e9quent autoris\u00e9e selon les conditions que j'ai expos\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9 par\nM.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision a trait \u00e0 une demande de la part de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) que le Tribunal tienne une seule et m\u00eame audience pour enqu\u00eater sur deux plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la plaignante contre le m\u00eame intim\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re plainte, que j'appellerai la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience (Dossier de la Commission no 20020557) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 31 juillet 2002. La deuxi\u00e8me plainte, que j'appellerai la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles (Dossier de la Commission no 20031212) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 20 janvier 2004.\n[2] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend dans sa plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience que son employeur, l'intim\u00e9e, a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Elle pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de l'accommoder lorsqu'elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler apr\u00e8s avoir subi une intervention chirurgicale et des traitements pour le cancer du colon.\n[3] Dans la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Elle \u00e9num\u00e8re une liste de 30 incidents qui, selon elle, constituent des repr\u00e9sailles. Elle pr\u00e9tend que ces agissements ont diminu\u00e9 son autorit\u00e9 au travail, nuit \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de mener ses t\u00e2ches \u00e0 bien et ont eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des membres du personnel et des gestionnaires qui \u00e9taient sous sa supervision. Le dernier incident de repr\u00e9sailles figurant sur cette liste est son licenciement, lequel s'est produit le 2 septembre 2003.\n[4] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience au Tribunal le 19 ao\u00fbt 2004. La plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2004 et \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'une lettre provenant de la pr\u00e9sidente demandant que la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles soit jointe avec la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience car la Commission s'est dite [Traduction] convaincue que les deux plaintes [Traduction] soulevaient essentiellement les m\u00eames question de fait et de droit. Le 20 janvier 2005, l'intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal qu'elle s'opposait \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes car elle ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 la position de la Commission que les m\u00eames questions \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es dans les deux cas.\n[5] Il n'y a rien dans la Loi qui concerne le pouvoir du Tribunal de joindre des plaintes lorsque celles-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la m\u00eame partie. Le paragraphe 40(4) pr\u00e9voit que la Commission peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal d'ordonner une instruction commune dans les situations o\u00f9 plusieurs personnes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes s\u00e9par\u00e9es contre le m\u00eame intim\u00e9. Ce n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Toutefois, comme le Tribunal l'a soulign\u00e9 dans Lattey c. C.P. et M. Douglas (25 f\u00e9vrier 2002), T685\/7301 et T686\/7401 (T.C.D.P.), paragraphe 11, la d\u00e9cision de tenir une ou plusieurs audiences sur des plaintes rel\u00e8ve de la proc\u00e9dure et en l'absence de directives pr\u00e9cises dans la Loi, il est loisible au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal devrait refuser d'entendre les deux plaintes dans le cadre de la m\u00eame audience car celles-ci soul\u00e8vent des questions tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience a trait \u00e0 un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 refus d'accommoder la plaignante, alors que la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles a trait au licenciement de la plaignante. L'intim\u00e9e souligne que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en vertu du Code canadien du travail, une plainte de cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Cette plainte sera entendue par un arbitre dans les prochains mois.\n[7] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e. La plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles traite de beaucoup plus d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements que de la seule question du cong\u00e9diement. La plaignante affirme express\u00e9ment que tous les incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans sa plainte, notamment son cong\u00e9diement, constituent des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son \u00e9gard parce qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. La question soulev\u00e9e n'est pas tellement de savoir si le cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante est injuste mais plut\u00f4t de savoir si l'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience constitue au moins un des facteurs de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plaignante, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Il s'agit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la forme de discrimination vis\u00e9e par cette disposition.\n[8] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il devait autoris\u00e9 la modification d'une plainte existante de discrimination afin d'ajouter une plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 14.1 (voir p. ex., Kavanagh c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (31 mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.); Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2; Blondin c. Courrier Purolator Lt\u00e9., 2005 TCDP 7). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans ces d\u00e9cisions qu'il est logique que la preuve relative \u00e0 des actes commis en repr\u00e9sailles du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soit entendue dans le contexte de l'audience de cette m\u00eame plainte. Toutefois, avant d'autoriser de telles modifications, le Tribunal doit \u00eatre convaincu que l'intim\u00e9 ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice en raison d'un avis insuffisant quant aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations. L'intim\u00e9 doit avoir l'occasion de se d\u00e9fendre d'une mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate.\n[9] Ces notions peuvent certainement \u00eatre \u00e9tendues \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente situation. Les all\u00e9gations mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles ne sont gu\u00e8re nouvelles pour l'intim\u00e9e - la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e il y a plus d'un an. On ne m'a pas convaincu que la jonction, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, de deux plaintes existantes s\u00e9par\u00e9es, mais li\u00e9es, serait susceptible de causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve. Au contraire, il semble \u00eatre dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun de l'ensemble des parties, notamment de l'intim\u00e9e, d'\u00e9viter la multiplication des instances\n[10] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement fait valoir que, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) de la Loi, la Commission peut refuser de traiter une plainte qui pourrait avantageusement \u00eatre instruite selon une autre proc\u00e9dure juridique. L'intim\u00e9e conteste la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas exercer ce pouvoir et de refuser de traiter la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles, compte tenu de la plainte en cours d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante en vertu du Code canadien du travail. L'intim\u00e9e demande en fait un examen de la conduite de la Commission quant \u00e0 la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles. Toutefois, il s'agit d'une affaire qui rel\u00e8ve exclusivement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et non pas du Tribunal (voir Eyerley c. Seaspan International Ltd., (2 ao\u00fbt 2000), T565\/2300 (T.C.D.P.), par. 4). Je ne peux donc pas examiner cette pr\u00e9tention.\n[11] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la demande de la Commission de joindre la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et la plainte d'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles est accueillie. Le Tribunal instruira les deux plaintes dans le cadre d'une seule et m\u00eame audience.\nAthanasios D.

Paul Groarke\n2005 TCDP 11\n2005\/02\/23\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2003 \u00e0 Saskatoon. L'intim\u00e9e a reconnu sa responsabilit\u00e9 et l'affaire s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur le fondement d'une entente sur les faits. La seule question pendante est le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 auquel la plaignante a droit pour perte de salaire.\n[2] Le Tribunal a rencontr\u00e9 divers obstacles en tentant de mener \u00e0 terme l'affaire. Selon mes calculs, la plaignante est responsable d'au moins cinq retards dans le processus et je suis certain que la responsabilit\u00e9 d'autres retards peut lui \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e. Certains retards peuvent d\u00e9pendre de son \u00e9tat psychologique. Les consid\u00e9rations d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire incombent n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la Commission.\n[3] La plaignante adopte la position qu'elle souffre du syndrome de stress post-traumatique et qu'elle est incapable de travailler. Elle attribue cette situation \u00e0 la discrimination dont elle a fait l'objet entre 1984 et 1996. L'intim\u00e9e et la Commission ont soutenu qu'il n'y a pas de preuve d\u00e9montrant que les effets de la discrimination ont emp\u00each\u00e9 la plaignante de trouver du travail. Elles affirment qu'une compensation de 22 000 $ pour deux ans de perte de salaire serait suffisante.\n[4] L'avocat de la plaignante, M. Korchin, a maintenant fourni au Tribunal un rapport m\u00e9dical et un affidavit de Mme McAuley. Les parties m'ont demand\u00e9 de traiter de la pertinence et de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de ces documents sur le fondement d'observations \u00e9crites. Bien que j'aie re\u00e7u des observations de tous les avocats, M. Korchin semble maintenant avoir chang\u00e9 d'id\u00e9e sur cette question. Tout ce que je peux dire, c'est qu'il est trop tard pour ce faire. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 annul\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande des parties, les journ\u00e9es d'audience restantes.\n[5] Bien que l'affidavit de Mme McAuley \u00e9tablisse sa conviction ferme selon laquelle la discrimination avait eu des effets psychologiques permanents, il ne contribue pas tellement aux positions adopt\u00e9es par les parties. Je ne peux voir aucune raison pour laquelle le simple affidavit ne serait pas admissible, sujet au droit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 tout contre-interrogatoire. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mme McAuley soit \u00e9pargn\u00e9e de la rigueur du t\u00e9moignage de vive voix.\n[6] Les pi\u00e8ces jointes \u00e0 l'affidavit posent plus de probl\u00e8mes. Elles incluent des documents provenant des dossiers du Dr Burgess, un psychiatre, qui contiennent la d\u00e9claration la plus percutante pour la plaignante. Dans un document, le Dr Burgess d\u00e9clare que [TRADUCTION] l'environnement de travail \u00e9tait assur\u00e9ment une cause, la seule cause de d\u00e9clenchement du syndrome de stress post-traumatique . Cette conclusion est naturellement fond\u00e9e sur des renseignements qu'il avait re\u00e7us de Mme McAuley.\n[7] Les mots exacts utilis\u00e9s par le Dr Burgess peuvent \u00eatre significatifs. Je fais cette affirmation parce qu'il mentionne le mot [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9clenchement du syndrome plut\u00f4t que le syndrome lui-m\u00eame. Ce fait est conforme avec la position de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle d'autres facteurs ont contribu\u00e9 aux origines du syndrome. La situation est plus complexe du fait que les documents du Dr Burgess proviennent de correspondance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme McAuley aupr\u00e8s du Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens.\n[8] Le rapport m\u00e9dical consiste en une br\u00e8ve lettre du Dr Li, un psychiatre, qui a apparemment vu en consultation la plaignante quatre ans apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut cess\u00e9 de consulter le Dr Burgess. La lettre contient seulement une \u00e9valuation tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la situation et est peu utile sans les documents fournis par le Dr Burgess. Les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, pris dans leur ensemble, peuvent \u00eatre suffisants pour \u00e9tablir que la cause imm\u00e9diate de tout syndrome de stress post-traumatique d\u00e9pend de la discrimination. La lettre ne fait pas de commentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la dur\u00e9e d'une telle cause.\n[9] M. Garden, au nom de l'intim\u00e9e, pr\u00e9tend que la preuve m\u00e9dicale n'est pas admissible. Sa pr\u00e9tention est principalement fond\u00e9e sur le fait que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner l'\u00e9tat psychologique de la plaignante et d'obtenir une opinion distincte sur la question. Il serait simplement injuste de laisser la plaignante fournir cette preuve sans donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre.\n[10] Ce type d'argument est fond\u00e9 sur les principes de justice naturelle. Il existe d'autres termes, comme la justice fondamentale ou m\u00eame l'application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de la loi, qui peuvent \u00eatre utiles. En fin de compte, cependant, la question est simplement de savoir si le processus est \u00e9quitable. Cette question requiert un exercice de jugement qui tient compte des divers facteurs qui sont soulev\u00e9s dans l'affaire. Je suis d'accord avec l'avocat lorsqu'il affirme que toute question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e selon le contexte de chaque affaire.\n[11] Je ne pense pas qu'il serait \u00e9quitable de laisser la plaignante pr\u00e9senter cette sorte de preuve psychiatrique sans donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e amplement l'occasion de r\u00e9pondre. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la situation exigerait une certaine sorte d'examen psychologique ind\u00e9pendant. Mme McAuley \u00e9tait h\u00e9sitante quant \u00e0 cette question. \u00c0 un moment, elle n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 subir un tel examen. \u00c0 un autre moment, son avocat a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'obtenir des instructions. \u00c0 encore un autre moment, elle semblait acquiescer, mais \u00e0 des conditions qui lui laisseraient, du moins symboliquement, la ma\u00eetrise du processus. Je ne peux pas accepter ces conditions.\n[12] Tout ce qu'on peut dire, c'est que la plaignante est extr\u00eamement r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 subir quelque sorte d'examen m\u00e9dical ou psychologique ind\u00e9pendant. Je ne conteste pas ses sentiments \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Des dossiers psychologiques fournissent les r\u00e9cits les plus personnels de nos vies. Dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui tient \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 l'autonomie personnelle, l'ordre public milite contre toute ordonnance qui obligerait un individu \u00e0 partager de tels dossiers avec un \u00e9tranger. Il n'y a pas de doute dans mon esprit que tout psychologue ou psychiatre engag\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e serait un \u00e9tranger au sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce mot.\n[13] Il existe des diff\u00e9rences importantes entre une \u00e9valuation psychologique et un examen m\u00e9dical. Je suis passablement certain qu'un psychologue et un psychiatre seraient mal \u00e0 l'aise \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e qu'un patient puisse \u00eatre oblig\u00e9, de force, de subir cette sorte de rencontre exploratoire qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir les origines du trouble psychologique. Pour une analyse plus compl\u00e8te de ces questions, je renverrais les parties \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dans l'affaire Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale, no 4 (18 d\u00e9cembre 2002).\n[14] Il y a une certaine reconnaissance de ces questions dans l'affaire Bion c. Sehok, QB 1998 SASK, dossier 770.45.20.00-01 (QL), cit\u00e9e par l'avocat de la plaignante. Je n'accepte pas, cependant, qu'il soit raisonnable de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante ou \u00e0 un certain organisme ind\u00e9pendant de nommer le psychiatre ou le psychologue qui proc\u00e9dera \u00e0 l'examen. Je comprends que la plaignante n'a pas confiance dans le processus juridique et le processus m\u00e9dical. Ce fait est regrettable, mais ne change pas la situation. Il ne serait pas \u00e9quitable pour l'intim\u00e9e qu'elle soit priv\u00e9e du droit de choisir son propre expert, \u00e0 moins que des raisons imp\u00e9rieuses aient \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De toute fa\u00e7on, les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire vont bien au-del\u00e0 de l'identit\u00e9 de l'expert qui sera propos\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e.\n[15] Il n'y a pas lieu de discuter de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'ordonner un examen psychologique. Les trois avocats semblent partager l'opinion qu'il ne serait pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat psychologique de Mme McAuley de subir un tel examen. Je pense que leur opinion m\u00e9rite une certaine dose de respect. Il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de jugement professionnel et m\u00eame moral qui intervient lorsque l'on traite de cette sorte de questions et qui am\u00e8ne les avocats au-del\u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9troits et personnels des parties. Dans les circonstances, je ne pense pas qu'il soit dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante, ou dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat plus \u00e9tendu du public, d'exiger qu'elle soit expos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'indignit\u00e9 potentielle d'un examen psychologique ind\u00e9pendant.\n[16] Quant \u00e0 la question m\u00e9dicale, c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l'affaire s'arr\u00eate. Je dispose des renseignements psychiatriques fournis par la plaignante. Le probl\u00e8me est que ces renseignements proviennent tous de la m\u00eame partie. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9, ce serait une contravention pure aux principes de justice naturelle les plus fondamentaux que de laisser la plaignante pr\u00e9senter de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sans donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une possibilit\u00e9 de faire la m\u00eame chose. Je suis par cons\u00e9quent d'avis que les documents m\u00e9dicaux ne sont pas admissibles.\n[17] Le deuxi\u00e8me argument est avanc\u00e9 par Mme Reaume, au nom de la Commission. Elle pr\u00e9tend simplement que les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux fournis par la plaignante ne sont pas importants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question soumise au Tribunal. Cette pr\u00e9tention ne m'aide pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 auquel la plaignante a droit pour perte de salaire. L'intim\u00e9e et la Commission ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que la discrimination \u00e9tait une cause imm\u00e9diate de l'\u00e9tat de la plaignante.\n[18] Je partage l'opinion de la Commission. M\u00eame si les documents \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve, ils sont de nature trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour \u00eatre tr\u00e8s utiles. Ils ne traitent pas de la question financi\u00e8re soumise au Tribunal. Je pense que les renseignements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'\u00e9tat psychologique sont trop entrecoup\u00e9s et impr\u00e9cis pour m'aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la mesure \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre tenue responsable des probl\u00e8mes persistants de la plaignante.\n[19] En fin de compte, il ne me reste que l'initiale entente sur les faits. Cette entente est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir que l'intim\u00e9e est responsable pour un montant de 22 000 $ pour perte de salaire, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le Tribunal ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui justifierait qu'un montant plus important soit accord\u00e9. Je ne vois aucune raison pour demander des observations additionnelles. Je vais n\u00e9anmoins demeurer saisi de l'affaire pendant 30 jours afin de permettre aux parties de soulever toute autre question qui pourrait requ\u00e9rir l'assistance du Tribunal. Une fois que les trente jours seront \u00e9coul\u00e9s, je donnerai au registraire la directive de d\u00e9livrer un avis de d\u00e9sistement et de fermer le dossier.\n[20] J'aimerais faire un dernier commentaire. Le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne est un processus de redressement. Je pense par cons\u00e9quent qu'il est important de reconna\u00eetre les mesures positives prises par les employeurs lorsqu'ils corrigent de telles questions. L'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est digne d'un m\u00e9rite consid\u00e9rable pour avoir reconnu sa responsabilit\u00e9 et avoir adopt\u00e9 une attitude constructive pour la r\u00e9solution de la plainte.

William Wilkerson, pr\u00e9sident de Global Business and Economic Roundtable on Addiction and Mental Health, soit qualifi\u00e9 d'expert dans le domaine de la gestion des questions de sant\u00e9 mentale en milieu de travail.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9 s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Il a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 trois d\u00e9cisions faisant autorit\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir : R. c. Mohan, (1994) 80 C.C.C. (3d) 401, une affaire en mati\u00e8re criminelle, Mayfield c. Mayfield, [2001] O.J. no 2212, une affaire en mati\u00e8re civile, et la d\u00e9cision du tribunal Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Ministre du Personnel du Gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, rendue le 27 ao\u00fbt 2001.\n[3] La d\u00e9cision Mohan traite en particulier des facteurs devant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s lorsque l'on tranche la question de savoir si une preuve d'expert est admissible. Selon cette d\u00e9cision, l'admission de la preuve d'expert repose sur l'application des crit\u00e8res suivants :\nla pertinence; la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aider le juge des faits; l'absence de toute r\u00e8gle d'exclusion; la qualification suffisante de l'expert.\n[4] Il faut toujours se rappeler, lors de l'application des crit\u00e8res de la d\u00e9cision Mohan dans le contexte d'un Tribunal, que nous ne traitons pas de l'admission de la preuve d'expert dans un contexte de proc\u00e8s devant jury et que la question de la qualification de l'expert ne peut pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le cadre d'un voir-dire o\u00f9 le juge en cause a la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer la preuve devant \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et d'y appliquer les crit\u00e8res de la d\u00e9cision Mohan.\n[5] Comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mon coll\u00e8gue, Paul Groarke, dans la d\u00e9cision AFPC :\nLa preuve d'expert a pour objet d'aider un organisme ayant le pouvoir de rendre la justice \u00e0 se prononcer sur les faits entourant une affaire. Elle aide en fournissant au juge des faits les renseignements et conclusions toutes faites qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre de leur exp\u00e9rience. Il s'ensuit que les experts ont un r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial dans les litiges faisant appel \u00e0 une preuve statistique ou scientifique. Il s'agit dans chaque cas de se demander si le t\u00e9moignage est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher les points en litige.\n[...]\nIl est important de distinguer les questions d\u00e9coulant d'une demande de permission pour appeler des t\u00e9moins de celles qui d\u00e9coulent de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage. La ligne de d\u00e9marcation est forc\u00e9ment floue, mais il convient particuli\u00e8rement d'attendre que le t\u00e9moin soit cit\u00e9 avant de se prononcer sur les questions ayant trait \u00e0 la pertinence et \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[6] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 semblait adopter la position selon laquelle la question pertinente \u00e9tait celle de savoir si la preuve qu'on entendait pr\u00e9senter \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher la question. Il est important de se rappeler qu'un Tribunal n'est pas en mesure, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de la qualification, d'appr\u00e9cier totalement la fiabilit\u00e9 de la preuve que le t\u00e9moin entend pr\u00e9senter. Le mieux qu'on puisse s'attendre \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape est que le Tribunal traite de la question de savoir si le t\u00e9moignage contribuerait logiquement \u00e0 la cause de la partie qui appelle le t\u00e9moin. Je dis en reprenant les mots de mon coll\u00e8gue Paul Groarke : Il suffit donc de pouvoir dire raisonnablement que le t\u00e9moignage de l'expert est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher une des questions de fait.\n[7] \u00c0 cette fin, et en toute \u00e9quit\u00e9 pour la partie adverse, il est important que le Tribunal et la partie adverse aient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'essentiel du t\u00e9moignage que l'expert entend pr\u00e9senter. C'est pourquoi les R\u00e8gles provisoires de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voient ce qui suit au paragraphe 6(4) :\n6(4) Si une partie donne avis de son intention d'appeler un t\u00e9moin expert conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)f), elle doit, en plus du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 requis en vertu de 6(1)f), signifier et d\u00e9poser un rapport au moins 10 jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience. Ledit rapport doit :\n\u00eatre sign\u00e9 par l'expert; pr\u00e9ciser le nom de l'expert, son adresse et ses titres de comp\u00e9tence; indiquer l'essentiel du t\u00e9moignage que l'expert en question entend pr\u00e9senter.\n[8] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l'avocat de la plaignante n'a pas donn\u00e9 un avis de son intention d'appeler un t\u00e9moin expert pas plus qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport indiquant l'essentiel du t\u00e9moignage que l'expert entendait pr\u00e9senter. Compte tenu de ces omissions, le Tribunal ne qualifiera pas ce t\u00e9moin de t\u00e9moin expert.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 23\nf\u00e9vrier 2005\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT928\/4804\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMary Mellon c.

Introduction [1] Fred Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre S & S Delivery Service, son ancien employeur. S & S appartient \u00e0 Brian Slobodian. M. Smith a travaill\u00e9 pour M. Slobodian de mars 2001 \u00e0 avril 2002. Il travaillait cinq jours par semaine et parfois le samedi. Il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 en fonction du kilom\u00e9trage parcouru.\n[2] La plainte \u00e9nonce que S & S Delivery :\n[Traduction]\n[\u2026] a fait de la discrimination \u00e0 mon endroit en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en exigeant, apr\u00e8s que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9, que je subisse un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues avant de m\u2019autoriser \u00e0 reprendre le travail et en me refusant un retour au travail en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue (d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 la drogue).\nIl sera \u00e9vident que la situation n\u2019est pas si simple.\n[3] L\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire a pris moins d\u2019un jour. M. Smith et M. Slobodian \u00e9taient les seuls t\u00e9moins. Ils n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019avocats. Leurs observations sont devenues des t\u00e9moignages et il \u00e9tait difficile de garder l\u2019instruction dans ses limites l\u00e9gitimes.\nII. Les faits [4] M. Smith et M. Slobodian n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9prouv\u00e9 de sympathie l\u2019un envers l\u2019autre. Le 23 avril 2002, le camion que conduisait M. Smith a frapp\u00e9 un nid\u2011de\u2011poule. Ce devait \u00eatre un nid\u2011de\u2011poule terrible. La t\u00eate de M. Smith a frapp\u00e9 le toit de la cabine et il a subi une grave blessure au cou. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail pendant six semaines et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des accidents du travail. Il a re\u00e7u six mille dollars de cet organisme.\n[5] M. Slobodian est convaincu que M. Smith ne portait pas sa ceinture de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lorsque sa t\u00eate a frapp\u00e9 le toit. M. Smith a admis qu\u2019il ne porte pas une ceinture lorsqu\u2019il conduit chez lui. Il affirme n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il portait une ceinture au moment de l\u2019accident. Il ajoute que le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me r\u00e9sulte de la construction du si\u00e8ge qui est fix\u00e9 sur des ressorts. Alors, en th\u00e9orie, sa t\u00eate aurait frapp\u00e9 le toit m\u00eame s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9 au si\u00e8ge.\n[6] Le 4 juin 2002, le physioth\u00e9rapeute de M. Smith lui a remis une lettre \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 reprendre le travail. M. Smith a apport\u00e9 la lettre \u00e0 S & S Delivery. Une heure et demie plus tard, il a re\u00e7u un appel lui disant qu\u2019il y avait une lettre de la compagnie au bureau. La lettre provenait de M. Slobodian et mentionnait que la compagnie avait une nouvelle politique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des drogues. M. Smith ne pourrait pas reprendre le travail avant qu\u2019il ait subi un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues.\n[7] M. Slobodian d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a instaur\u00e9 la politique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des drogues pendant que M. Smith b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de l\u2019indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail. Cependant, il y a plus que cela. M. Slobodian dit candidement qu\u2019il esp\u00e9rait que M. Smith \u00e9choue au test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. Il l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu entrer dans la cour de l\u2019entreprise avec les yeux rougis. M. Slobodian d\u00e9clare n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s de subir un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues.\n[8] M. Smith pense qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de politique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des drogues. Il dit que personne d\u2019autre n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet de tests. Je ne sais pas s\u2019il y avait v\u00e9ritablement une politique. Si oui, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une politique qui \u00e9tait plus ad hoc qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb l\u2019\u00eatre. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9vident, m\u00eame lors de l\u2019audience, que M. Slobodian est col\u00e9rique. M. Slobodian affirme que lui et M. Smith [Traduction] s\u2019affrontaient constamment. Je pense que M. Smith est d\u2019accord avec M. Slobodian \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[9] L\u2019attitude de M. Smith posait un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 M. Slobodian. Il affirme que des clients lui ont dit que M. Smith parlait de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative de ses activit\u00e9s et de son \u00e9quipement. Il a mentionn\u00e9 un appel re\u00e7u de quelqu\u2019un de Revelstoke. M. Slobodian a eu six semaines pour penser \u00e0 cela pendant que M. Smith b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de l\u2019indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail. Il ne voulait pas que M. Smith revienne travailler pour lui.\n[10] M. Smith est demeur\u00e9 in\u00e9branlable. Il a adopt\u00e9 la position selon laquelle il \u00e9tait encore un employ\u00e9 de S & S Delivery. Il a consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin et il a demand\u00e9 un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. Les r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 M. Slobodian le 11 juin. Ils \u00e9taient n\u00e9gatifs. M. Smith a demand\u00e9 du travail. M. Slobodian a dit qu\u2019il l\u2019appellerait. Il ne l\u2019a jamais fait.\n[11] M. Smith a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au bureau \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises. \u00c0 la fin de juin, il a vu dans le journal StarPhoenix une annonce de S & S qui cherchait un chauffeur. Il a donc su qu\u2019il y avait du travail. M. Smith a essay\u00e9 de prendre contact avec M. Slobodian, sans succ\u00e8s. Les communications ont cess\u00e9. Il y a eu une autre annonce en ao\u00fbt.\n[12] La querelle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas finie. M. Smith a eu recours aux normes du travail \u00e0 la fin de juin. Neil Klassen, l\u2019agent des normes du travail, a dit qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 deux semaines de salaire en guise et lieu d\u2019avis. M. Klassen a discut\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire avec S & S et apr\u00e8s des menaces de poursuites de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et un appel, M. Smith a re\u00e7u un ch\u00e8que pour deux semaines de salaire. \u00c0 la fin d\u2019ao\u00fbt, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[13] M. Smith veut maintenant recevoir son salaire pour la p\u00e9riode entre juin et septembre. M. Slobodian est d\u2019avis que cela est exag\u00e9r\u00e9. M. Smith a d\u00e9j\u00e0 per\u00e7u douze mille dollars \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail et environ 1 500 dollars de salaire en guise et lieu d\u2019avis. Bien qu\u2019il ne cite aucun texte de loi, M. Slobodian pr\u00e9tend que M. Smith a reconnu que l\u2019emploi s\u2019est termin\u00e9 en juin lorsqu\u2019il a eu recours aux normes du travail et qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 du salaire en guise et lieu d\u2019avis.\n[14] Cette pr\u00e9tention est peut\u2011\u00eatre fond\u00e9e. M. Smith a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tout ce que M. Slobodian avait \u00e0 faire \u00e9tait de lui dire, directement, qu\u2019il avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Cependant, il a insist\u00e9 sur ce point. M. Slobodian a admis lors de l\u2019audience qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plus franc lorsque M. Smith est venu le voir le 5 juin. Il aurait d\u00fb dire \u00e0 M. Smith qu\u2019il mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi. Il aurait d\u00fb lui payer le salaire en guise et lieu d\u2019avis. Mais, il ne pense pas qu\u2019il soit juste de lui demander quoi que ce soit de plus.\nIII. Droit et analyse [15] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e suivant l\u2019article 7 et l\u2019article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019article 10 mentionne des lignes de conduite en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. L\u2019argument est que la politique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des drogues, s\u2019il y en avait une, faisait de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de ceux qui souffrent d\u2019une d\u00e9pendance aux drogues.\n[16] M. Smith avait peu, sinon rien, \u00e0 dire sur cet aspect de l\u2019affaire et je ne peux voir aucun motif pour en traiter. Les deux hommes s\u2019entendaient sur le fait que le d\u00e9pistage de drogues est une pratique normale dans l\u2019industrie du transport, du moins pour les chauffeurs qui se rendent aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Dans la d\u00e9cision Milazzo c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Motor Coach Canada, 2005 TCDP 5, le Tribunal a reconnu la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de conditions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans l\u2019industrie du transport.\n[17] La v\u00e9ritable question s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cette disposition \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu; [\u2026]\n[18] M. Smith pr\u00e9tend que S & S a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l\u2019employer sur le fondement qu\u2019il pouvait faire usage de drogues.\n[19] Les faits n\u2019appuient pas cette sorte de pr\u00e9tention. La situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente s\u2019il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que M. Slobodian avait un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des chauffeurs qui avaient pu faire usage de drogues. Dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel, cependant, la preuve sugg\u00e8re simplement que M. Slobodian ne voulait pas que M. Smith reprenne le travail. Ils \u00e9taient devenus des ennemis. Le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues n\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment pas pertinent. C\u2019\u00e9tait simplement un stratag\u00e8me, un truc pour emp\u00eacher M. Smith de revenir travailler dans l\u2019entreprise.\n[20] Cependant, le probl\u00e8me est plus profond. Je ne peux pas voir comment le comportement de M. Slobodian est vis\u00e9 par le sens du mot discrimination. Le dictionnaire Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary \u00e9nonce que la discrimination consiste, dans un sens, \u00e0 traiter une personne diff\u00e9remment [Traduction] sur une base autre que le m\u00e9rite individuel. Il donne ensuite deux exemples, \u00e0 savoir : [Traduction] faire de la discrimination en faveur de vos amis et [Traduction] faire de la discrimination contre une certaine nationalit\u00e9.\n[21] Le dictionnaire Compact Oxford Dictionary donne une d\u00e9finition similaire. Il \u00e9nonce que la discrimination consiste en [Traduction] une distinction injuste dans le traitement de diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de personnes, notamment en raison de motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, le sexe ou l\u2019\u00e2ge. Cette d\u00e9finition refl\u00e8te l\u2019utilisation l\u00e9gale contemporaine du mot. L\u2019id\u00e9e est qu\u2019une personne est trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment en raison de son appartenance \u00e0 un certain groupe.\n[22] M. Smith pr\u00e9tend dans la plainte que M. Slobodian a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l\u2019employer parce qu\u2019il pensait qu\u2019il faisait usage de drogues. Je ne peux pas voir cela. Toute la preuve sugg\u00e8re que le litige entre M. Smith et M. Slobodian \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement personnel. M. Slobodian n\u2019a jamais aim\u00e9 M. Smith. Il pensait que M. Smith a menti lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail. M. Slobodian peut s\u2019\u00eatre tromp\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il admet qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas de preuve, mais ce qui importe c\u2019est que son ressentiment se rapportait express\u00e9ment \u00e0 M. Smith. Il ne se rapportait pas \u00e0 son appartenance \u00e0 un groupe.\n[23] On peut pr\u00e9tendre que M. Slobodian a trait\u00e9 M. Smith diff\u00e9remment en raison de l\u2019accident. Cela peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Je suppose qu\u2019il est possible que M. Slobodian ait eu une dent contre quiconque assez malchanceux pour se blesser au travail. Peut\u2011\u00eatre voyait\u2011il cela comme une tache contre son entreprise ou peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e9tait\u2011il pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des implications financi\u00e8res. Toutefois, il s\u2019agit de simples hypoth\u00e8ses.\n[24] Dans les circonstances, je ne pense pas que l\u2019affaire soit vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. C\u2019est un litige priv\u00e9 entre deux hommes qui ne s\u2019aiment pas. M. Smith peut avoir ou non des motifs pour une poursuite. Mais, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une autre question. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019un groupe identifiable. Il n\u2019existe aucune des comparaisons que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 requiert. Cela est essentiel.\n[25] Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une cour. Il y a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne qui le distingue des litiges priv\u00e9s. Cela est vrai m\u00eame lorsque les questions se rapportent, en fin de compte, exclusivement aux parties. Le point est fondamental. Le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne met en cause des int\u00e9r\u00eats plus larges qui touchent chacun dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour juger une demande priv\u00e9e dans le domaine des contrats ou dans certains autres domaines du droit.\n[26] Je ne suis pas certain que je puisse en dire plus pour apaiser l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties. Je pense que M. Smith et M. Slobodian ont probablement besoin de passer \u00e0 autre chose.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La dcision suivante traite de la question de savoir si le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens. J'ai dj rendu une dcision l'gard de cette question dans l'affaire Brown c. GRC, 2004 TCDP 30, dans laquelle j'ai conclu que le Tribunal avait un pouvoir rsiduel d'adjuger les dpens. Aprs avoir examin les prtentions des deux parties, je me retrouve dans la mme situation dans la prsente affaire.\n[2] L'intim s'est fond principalement sur l'arrt Digby Municipal School Board c. CUPE, Local 118 (1982), 135 D.L.R. (3d) 582 (C.A. N.-.), qui a t confirm par la Cour suprme de Nouvelle-cosse (1983), 1 D.L.R. (4th) 1. Mme si l'arrt Digby traitait de la comptence de la commission des relations de travail, il contient un compte rendu convaincant quant la loi antrieure. Cet ensemble de rgles de droit prvoit qu'un organisme juridictionnel qui a un pouvoir qui lui a t accord par la loi n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens moins que la loi lui confre ce pouvoir.\n[3] Je connais bien cet arrt. Il s'avre que l'intim s'est fond galement sur la dcision que j'ai rendue dans l'affaire Brown, au paragraphe 70, o j'ai dclar ce qui suit :\nLa Loi ne fait pas mention du pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens. La question est tout simplement passe sous silence. [...] Si le lgislateur avait eu l'intention de donner au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens, il l'aurait fait conformment aux rgles et conventions applicables.\nJ'accepte naturellement cette affirmation. Je partage l'opinion selon laquelle la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne donne pas au Tribunal la [TRADUCTION] comptence expresse d'adjuger les dpens.\n[4] Cela ne conclut pas l'affaire. Je dois contester la position adopte par l'intim au paragraphe 12 de ses observations, dans lequel il dclare ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa lgislation en matire des droits de la personne dans la plupart des provinces contient des dispositions expresses l'gard des dpens. Ce fait confirme que lorsque la lgislature a l'intention d'accorder un tribunal des droits de la personne la comptence d'adjuger les dpens, elle le fait expressment. S'il y a absence d'une disposition expresse, c'est que le lgislateur ne devait pas avoir l'intention que le Tribunal ait comptence pour adjuger les dpens.\nJe ne partage pas l'opinion selon laquelle la deuxime proposition rsulte de la premire proposition.\n[5] En fait, dans l'affaire Brown, j'ai limit mes commentaires l'affirmation selon laquelle le lgislateur n'avait pas l'intention de donner au Tribunal un pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens dans les circonstances qui existaient au moment o la loi a t rdige. C'est peut-tre une distinction pointue, mais cela ne signifie pas qu'il avait l'intention de priver le Tribunal d'un tel pouvoir dans les circonstances qui existent dans l'affaire Brown et dans la prsente affaire. La pratique de la Commission des droits de la personne s'est dveloppe avec le temps et la situation n'est pas la mme qu'elle tait lorsque la loi a t adopte.\n[6] Il sera vident que ma dcision est limite aux cas dans lesquels la Commission ne comparat pas. Bien que le lgislateur n'ait pas donn au Tribunal un pouvoir exprs d'adjuger les dpens, je pense qu'il y a dans la Loi une ngation suffisante pour dmontrer ses intentions. L'une de ces intentions, du moins dans les cas o la Commission comparat, est qu'un plaignant qui a gain de cause ne sera pas accabl par les frais juridiques. Je pense qu'il est un peu arbitraire de faire une distinction entre les plaignants qui bnficient de la prsence de la Commission et ceux qui doivent, par la force des choses, engager leur propre avocat.\n[7] Cela se rsume une question de reprsentation. Le droit en matire des droits de la personne est devenu relativement complexe et l'exprience du Tribunal traiter avec des parties profanes a dmontr que l'efficacit du processus dpend dans une certaine mesure de l'assistance des avocats. C'est particulirement vrai dans la prsente affaire qui comportait un examen dtaill des antcdents d'emploi de M. Brooks. Dans un cas o la Commission dcide de ne pas comparatre, il me semble que le plaignant a le droit d'tre reprsent par un avocat. Il s'ensuit que quelqu'un doit payer pour cette reprsentation.\n[8] M. Bagambiire a des rticences l'gard de la divulgation publique de ses notes d'honoraires. Je pense qu'il est important cependant que la ralit de la situation soit expose en entier devant la Cour fdrale dans l'ventualit o l'affaire ferait l'objet d'un contrle. Un montant de cinq mille dollars a t accord M. Brooks pour prjudice moral, le montant maximal prvu suivant l'ancienne Loi, sur consentement des parties. Je ne sais pas quels seraient les dpens, aprs taxation, mais les notes d'honoraires dposes en preuve suggrent certainement que les frais juridiques du plaignant pourraient atteindre cent mille dollars.\n[9] Je pense que cette situation est suffisante pour inciter quiconque marquer un temps d'arrt. L'omission du Tribunal d'adjuger les dpens dans la prsente affaire ne pnaliserait pas seulement un plaignant qui a eu gain de cause. Cette omission dcouragerait galement des plaignants de dposer des plaintes l'avenir. Il m'apparat que cela va l'encontre de ce que la Loi vise et de la jurisprudence actuelle. Je ne peux pas voir comment le Tribunal peut approuver une situation dans laquelle un plaignant qui a eu gain de cause subit une perte rsultant des frais juridiques qui doivent tre pays pour mener l'affaire une conclusion favorable. Cela contredirait les fins de la lgislation.\n[10] La jurisprudence tablit que le principe de recouvrement prvu par la Loi est le principe de la restitution intgrale. Les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne se rapportant au redressement sont extrmement larges et envisagent qu'un plaignant qui a eu gain de cause recouvrera toutes les dpenses relies au litige. Je ne peux pas me rsoudre, titre de point de droit, interprter le mot dpenses d'une faon inclure les frais juridiques. Il m'apparat nanmoins de faon frappante qu'il soit plutt difficile de suggrer que le lgislateur se soit efforc de s'assurer qu'un plaignant recouvrerait toutes ses dpenses, mais aucun de ses frais juridiques dans un cas o il a clairement besoin d'un avocat.\n[11] Je dois mentionner que l'intim soulve galement une question plus technique. Il ressort de faon vidente de l'arrt Banca Nazionale c. Lee-Shanok, [1988] A.C.F. no 594 (QL), et de l'arrt Oasis Hotel Ltd. c. Zurich Insurance Co., [1981] B.C.J. no 690 (QL), deux arrts que j'ai cits dans l'affaire Brown, qu'il existe une autre source qui donne le pouvoir d'adjuger les dpens. Ce pouvoir provient de l'equity. La question est celle de savoir si les redressements offerts un plaignant qui a gain de cause suivant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne peuvent tre dcrits comme quitables. L'intim rpond non cette question.\n[12] Il est vrai que le Tribunal est un organisme cr par la loi qui n'a que les pouvoirs qui lui sont confrs par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cependant, la Loi est rparatrice. Elle traite des droits de l'homme, des droits qui sont aussi connus comme les droits de la personne. Ce volet du droit ne fait pas partie du droit ordinaire. Il s'agit de droits fondamentaux. Son importance a t reconnue tant sur le plan interne que sur le plan international. Il fait partie d'une norme imprative du droit international.\n[13] C'est l que l'analyse de l'intim s'effondre. Le principal arrt cit par l'intim, Digby Municipal School Board c. CUPE, prcit, se trouve en dehors du volet des droits de la personne. Bien que les cours soient places dans la meilleure position pour trancher les questions se rapportant l'quit, il m'apparat que l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne fait une distinction avec d'autres lois. Il est bien tabli en droit qu'une mthode littrale d'interprtation n'a pas sa place dans le contexte de la Loi. Je ne pense pas que le lgislateur ait eu l'intention que les questions se rapportant l'galit soient djoues par une lecture trop minutieuse des subtilits de la Loi.\n[14] Je pense que le Tribunal a une obligation de protger l'efficacit et l'intgrit de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Tout l'objet de la Loi est de fournir un redressement valable ceux qui ont fait l'objet de discrimination. Je ne vois pas comment cela est possible, du moins dans un cas dans lequel la Commission dcide de ne pas comparatre, sans une adjudication des dpens. L'ide qu'un plaignant qui a fait l'objet de discrimination devrait avoir payer un montant de l'ordre de cent mille dollars pour une rclamation d'une valeur de cinq mille dollars, et subir toute la gamme de difficults qui accompagnent les litiges, est indfendable. Le remde est pire que la maladie.\n[15] Bien que les dispositions de la Charte des droits et liberts puissent avoir une certaine influence sur la question qui est soumise au Tribunal, ces dispositions n'ont jamais t invoques par les parties. Je vais par consquent laisser d'autres le soin d'enquter sur cet aspect de l'affaire.\nM.

Grant Sinclair\nPierre Deschamps\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Bell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle elle demande que le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de M. Lawrence Gould que l'on entend pr\u00e9senter ne soit pas admis en preuve par le Tribunal parce que l'objet de son t\u00e9moignage fait partie de la connaissance et de l'exp\u00e9rience du Tribunal. Au soutien de sa requ\u00eate, Bell s'appuie sur l'arr\u00eat Mohan et pr\u00e9tend que le t\u00e9moignage ou la preuve de M. Gould n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[2] Suivant le paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, comme nous en avons trait\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises au cours des derniers jours, le Tribunal peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu'il estime justifi\u00e9s sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 9.12 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal qui pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9riode et un taux pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 moins d'une ordonnance contraire du Tribunal. CEP se pr\u00e9sente au Tribunal pour lui demander qu'il rende une ordonnance contraire et s'appuie sur la preuve d'expert de M. Gould pour \u00e9tablir le taux et la m\u00e9thode de calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats qui devraient s'appliquer dans ce cas particulier.\n[3] Le Tribunal a qualifi\u00e9 M. Gould d'expert en mati\u00e8re de finances. Ainsi, le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de M. Gould selon lequel les questions des int\u00e9r\u00eats et de la m\u00e9thode de calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats font partie int\u00e9grante des finances et de l'expertise financi\u00e8re, comme il les d\u00e9crit. Compte tenu de ce t\u00e9moignage et de la preuve quant \u00e0 sa formation universitaire et \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience, M. Gould a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 en tant qu'expert pour rendre un t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats et de la m\u00e9thode de calcul appropri\u00e9s.\n[4] L'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9s ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire, sous r\u00e9serve du droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9. \u00c0 notre avis, comme nous l'avons mentionn\u00e9 hier au moment o\u00f9 les observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate, il s'agit du point de d\u00e9part pour \u00e9tablir l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve d'expert.\n[5] L'arr\u00eat Mohan expose quatre crit\u00e8res \u00e0 examiner \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve d'expert. Ces crit\u00e8res sont les suivants : (a) la pertinence, (b) la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aider le juge des faits, (c) l'absence de toute r\u00e8gle d'exclusion et (d) la qualification suffisante de l'expert. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, les crit\u00e8res (a), (c) et (d) ne sont pas en cause et seul le crit\u00e8re (b) est la question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e. \u00c0 notre avis, compte tenu de l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP, l'arr\u00eat Mohan n'est pas strictement applicable lorsque la question de l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert est soulev\u00e9e devant le Tribunal.\n[6] Cependant, compte tenu des faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de la nature de la preuve que M. Gould entend pr\u00e9senter et sans expliquer en d\u00e9tail de quelle fa\u00e7on l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) interagit avec l'arr\u00eat Mohan, nous sommes convaincus que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l'arr\u00eat Mohan peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce et nous r\u00e9pondons de fa\u00e7on affirmative \u00e0 la question se rapportant au crit\u00e8re (b), estimant qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'admettre la preuve d'expert de M. Gould.\n[7] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aider le juge des faits, la Cour a statu\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Mohan que l'exigence est que l'opinion soit n\u00e9cessaire au sens qu'elle fournit des renseignements qui selon toute vraisemblance d\u00e9passent l'exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d'un juge, d'un jury ou du juge des faits. En faisant cette d\u00e9claration, la Cour a en outre renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la preuve doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au juge des faits d'appr\u00e9cier la nature technique des questions en litige.\n[8] \u00c0 notre avis, en raison de la complexit\u00e9 des questions que M. Gould entend traiter et des questions en litige \u00e0 trancher, le Tribunal a conclu que son t\u00e9moignage d'expert sera utile pour l'aider \u00e0 trancher les questions en litige qui sont soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il est justifi\u00e9 d'accorder. Nous avons en outre conclu que la question trait\u00e9e dans son rapport d\u00e9passe notre expertise et notre connaissance. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de Bell est rejet\u00e9e et la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Gould sera admise par le Tribunal.\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 10 fvrier 2005, l'intime, les Forces armes canadiennes, a prsent une requte prliminaire en vue d'obtenir le rejet de la plainte dpose par Terry Buffett (le plaignant). L'intime soutient que la discrimination allgue ne constitue pas un refus de fournir un avantage en matire d'emploi fond sur l'un des motifs numrs l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6. L'intime prtend qu'tant donn qu'il n'y a pas de relations de travail entre elle et l'pouse du plaignant, le comportement n'entre pas dans le cadre de l'emploi. En outre, l'intime ajoute que la prestation de soins de sant qui se limite ses membres seulement suivant le Rgime de soins de sant des Forces canadiennes est une diffrence qui n'est fonde que sur le statut d'emploi qui n'est pas un motif numr dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] L'intime a en outre mentionn que la prestation de soins de sant assurs par les Forces armes canadiennes n'est pas une pratique ou une politique en matire d'emploi qui se rapporte des chances d'emploi et n'est pas, par consquent, vise par l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] Lors de l'audience prliminaire, l'intime a en outre soulev la question de savoir si le plaignant avait satisfait au critre lgal pour tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nII. LES FAITS [4] Aux fins de la requte prliminaire, les parties se sont entendues sur les faits ci-aprs mentionns.\nA. Le systme de soins de sant du Canada [5] Aux termes de la Loi constitutionnelle, et comme la Loi canadienne sur la sant l'nonce, le Canada a un systme de soins de sant universel suivant lequel les provinces, avec une contribution pcuniaire du gouvernement fdral, sont charges de fournir les soins de sant essentiels leurs rsidents.\n[6] La seule exception ce systme touche les groupes de personnes relevant directement du gouvernement fdral, y compris les Forces armes canadiennes, qui ne bnficient pas de la protection offerte par le rgime de soins de sant provincial.\n[7] La Loi constitutionnelle attribue au gouvernement fdral la responsabilit de fournir des soins de sant aux membres des Forces armes canadiennes aux frais de l'tat. L'intime offre ses membres des soins de sant complets comparables ceux garantis par la Loi canadienne sur la sant. Les services de soins de sant fournis par l'intime sont sur un pied d'galit avec le rgime de soins de sant provincial et remplissent le mme rle.\nB. Les services de sant des Forces armes canadiennes [8] Le Rgime de soins de sant des Forces canadiennes est rgi par le Groupe des services de sant des Forces canadiennes qui est charg de fournir des services de sant aux membres des Forces armes canadiennes.\n[9] L'intime a labor d'importantes infrastructures pour la prestation de soins de sant l'intrieur et l'extrieur du Canada et gre les soins de sant avec un budget annuel de plus de 728 millions de dollars.\n[10] L'intime s'efforce de fournir ses membres l'accs aux mmes soins de sant auxquels s'attend le Canadien moyen. Toutefois, l'intime a en outre ajout des critres de prestation de soins de sant associs la nature des activits des Forces armes canadiennes. L'intime a un noyau de professionnels de la sant en uniforme et elle embauche forfait de nombreux spcialistes de la sant civils pour fournir des soins ses membres. L'intime offre des services de sant de base amliors, notamment des services d'un mdecin de famille, des analyses de laboratoire, des soins de sant mentale, des mdicaments, de la physiothrapie, des services sociaux et des soins dentaires.\n[11] L'intime s'appuie en outre sur diverses ententes avec des organismes de soins de sant civils pour l'aider fournir des soins complets ses membres. Lorsqu'il est ncessaire qu'un membre utilise les services d'un professionnel de la sant civil, l'organisme civil prsente l'intime une facture cet gard.\nC. La politique l'gard de la Gamme de soins garantis par les Forces canadiennes [12] La politique l'gard de la Gamme de soins garantis par les Forces canadiennes dcrit les services et les soins de sant qui sont offerts et pays par l'tat aux membres des Forces armes canadiennes. Les cinq principes qui sont pris en compte pour tablir l'tendue des services offerts sont les suivants :\nla prestation du service est ncessaire pour prvenir les maladies en vue de maintenir la sant et le bien-tre mental et de diagnostiquer ou traiter les blessures, les maladies ou les incapacits; la prestation du service assure la gurison ou aide le militaire se rtablir afin qu'il retrouve son statut oprationnel et qu'il puisse tre envoy en mission pour l'intime; la prestation du service est conforme au principe scientifique d'une mdecine fonde sur des rsultats cliniques et scientifiques; la prestation du service ne doit pas constituer de la recherche purement exprimentale ou tre effectue des fins esthtiques; la prestation du service doit tre finance par un seul rgime d'assurance-maladie provincial ou par un organisme fdral.\n[13] Il y a en outre un processus prvu par le Groupe des services de sant des Forces canadiennes par lequel des demandes de paiement d'actes mdicaux non assurs par le rgime de soins de sant de l'intime peuvent tre prsentes par des membres des Forces armes canadiennes et considres par l'intime.\nD. Les soins aux personnes charge [14] L'intime n'a pas un programme de soins de sant pays par l'tat pour les familles de ses membres et elle n'a pas de mandat confr par la loi de fournir des soins mdicaux des personnes qui ne sont pas membres des Forces armes canadiennes. Les conjoints et les enfants de ses membres reoivent leurs soins de sant du rgime de soins de sant de la province dans laquelle ils rsident ou du rgime de soins de sant de la fonction publique.\n[15] Il existe un nombre de circonstances limites et exceptionnelles dans lesquelles le personnel mdical de l'intime peut fournir des soins mdicaux aux membres des familles de son personnel. Ces circonstances se limitent aux situations d'urgence dans des endroits loigns ou dans le cas o les membres de la famille accompagnent un membre lorsqu'il est en poste l'extrieur du Canada.\nE. Le plaignant [16] Le plaignant dtient le grade de sergent dans la Force rgulire des Forces armes canadiennes. Il est actuellement en poste la BFC de Gagetown, dans la province du Nouveau-Brunswick, et il reoit des soins de sant du rgime de soins de sant de l'intime. Rhonda Buffett, son pouse, n'est pas membre des Forces armes canadiennes. Elle rside dans la province du Nouveau-Brunswick et au cours de la priode en cause elle recevait des soins de sant du rgime d'assurance-maladie du Nouveau-Brunswick.\n[17] Le plaignant et son pouse ont eu de la difficult avoir des enfants. L'pouse du plaignant a subi quatre fausses couches au dbut de leur mariage. la suite de ces difficults, le couple a subi des examens mdicaux afin d'tablir la cause de leur problme. Les examens mdicaux subis par le plaignant taient assurs par le rgime de soins de sant de l'intime. Les examens ont rvl que la cause de l'infertilit tait imputable au plaignant.\n[18] Le plaignant a subi d'autres traitements mdicaux pour son tat. Il a subi une varicocle, une intervention chirurgicale qui tait paye par le rgime de soins de sant de l'intime. Un traitement l'aide de mdicaments, le seul autre traitement possible pour son tat, n'tait pas recommand dans son cas.\n[19] Le mdecin du plaignant a recommand une fcondation in vitro (FIV) et une injection intracytoplasmique d'un spermatozode (ICSI) jugeant que ces actes mdicaux constituaient les meilleures possibilits pour que l'pouse du plaignant devienne enceinte. Pour la FIV, les mdecins prescrivent des mdicaments la femme afin de stimuler la production de plusieurs ovules qui sont retirs des ovaires et mis en incubation. L'chantillon de sperme est alors mlang avec les ovules de la femme dans une bote de Petri. Si la fcondation a lieu, un petit nombre d'embryons en rsultant sont placs dans l'utrus de la femme.\n[20] L'ICSI peut tre utilise avec des spermatozodes immobiles durant la fcondation in vitro. Pour l'ICSI, un chantillon de sperme est valu au microscope. Un seul spermatozode est choisi dans l'chantillon et est inject, avec une aiguille, directement dans un ovule. L'ovule fcond est plac dans un incubateur. L'embryon en rsultant est implant dans l'utrus de la femme.\n[21] Le plaignant a demand que des traitements de FIV et d'ICSI pour son pouse soient pays par l'intime.\n[22] La politique de l'intim l'gard de la Gamme de soins garantis prvoit les services qui sont assurs relativement l'infertilit, savoir :\nl'investigation; le traitement par des mdicaments; le traitement chirurgical; l'insmination artificielle; la fcondation in vitro. Cependant, ce traitement n'est assur que dans les cas suivants :\nl'infertilit est attribuable une obstruction des trompes de Fallope ; le traitement est autoris pendant trois cycles au maximum; le traitement est offert uniquement au militaire en service actif et non aux personnes charge, au conjoint ou au partenaire.\n[23] La demande prsente par le plaignant a t rejete parce que la personne qui aurait reu le traitement assur n'tait pas un membre des Forces armes canadiennes. En d'autres mots, l'intime a refus de payer pour une FIV et une ICSI parce que la FIV et l'ICSI ne peuvent tre pratiques que sur une femme et que l'pouse du plaignant n'tait pas membre des Forces armes canadiennes. L'expos des faits sur lequel les parties se sont entendues mentionne que mme si l'pouse avait t membre des Forces armes canadiennes, sa demande aurait galement t rejete parce que le traitement demand n'est pas vis par la disposition particulire prvoyant le paiement du traitement tant donn que l'pouse ne souffrait pas d'une obstruction des trompes de Fallope.\n[24] Les soins assurs par le rgime de l'intime l'gard de l'infertilit sont les mmes que ceux assurs par l'Assurance-sant de l'Ontario et le Rgime de soins de sant de la fonction publique. Aucun autre rgime de soins de sant provincial ne paie les frais d'une FIV. Il n'y a actuellement aucun rgime d'assurance-maladie au Canada qui paie les frais d'une ICSI.\n[25] Mme Buffett a effectivement demand que les traitements de FIV et d'ICSI soient pays par le Rgime d'assurance-maladie du Nouveau-Brunswick, mais sa demande a t refuse. Elle a en outre demand que les traitements soient pays par le Rgime des soins de sant de la fonction publique et sa demande a galement t refuse.\n[26] Le 23 mai 2002, le plaignant a dpos sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne dans laquelle il prtend que le fait de payer les traitements contre l'infertilit subis par les femmes seulement, par les femmes qui sont membres des Forces armes canadiennes et qui souffrent d'obstruction des trompes de Fallope, constitue de la discrimination fonde sur le sexe, la dficience et la situation de famille contraire l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le 3 fvrier 2004, il a modifi sa plainte pour ajouter que l'intime avait appliqu une politique discriminatoire contraire l'article 10 de la Loi.\nIII. LES PRTENTIONS DE L'INTIME [27] L'intime a mentionn l'ensemble complexe de lois fdrales et provinciales qui rgissent la prestation de services de sant assurs universels au Canada. Elle a en outre mentionn la Loi sur la dfense nationale, L.R.C. 1985, ch. N-5, qui tablit l'organisation, l'administration et les responsabilits cet gard. En vertu du paragraphe 12(2) de cette loi, le ministre responsable a le pouvoir de prendre des rglements pour la bonne administration des Forces armes canadiennes. Suivant ce paragraphe, les Ordonnances et rglements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes, ch. 34, (le rglement), ont t adopts. Ce Rglement nonce les exigences se rapportant la prestation de services de sant aux membres des Forces armes canadiennes.\n[28] Le paragraphe 34.07(4) du Rglement mentionne que les soins de sant doivent tre fournis tous les membres des Forces armes canadiennes aux frais de l'tat. De plus, l'article 34.23 nonce que les services de sant ne peuvent tre fournis aux personnes charge que dans des circonstances trs limites. On demande normalement aux membres de la famille d'utiliser les services de sant assurs qui sont offerts par le gouvernement de la province o ils rsident. Dans le cas de l'pouse du plaignant, il s'agit de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick. Les personnes charge sont galement admissibles des services fournis des tiers par le Rgime de soins de sant de la fonction publique.\n[29] L'intime, aprs avoir expos le cadre lgislatif, a trait du principe bien connu selon lequel, dans un cas de discrimination, il appartient au plaignant d'tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans le cas de la prsente plainte, cela signifie que le plaignant doit dmontrer, selon la prpondrance des probabilits, que les actions de l'intime constituent un [TRADUCTION] acte discriminatoire en matire d'emploi qui cre une diffrence fonde sur un motif de distinction illicite . Lorsque la preuve prima facie de discrimination a t tablie, le fardeau de la preuve est alors transfr l'intime qui doit tablir, selon la prpondrance des probabilits, un motif justifiant les actes poss l'endroit du plaignant.\n[30] Selon l'intime, la demande suivant l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne devrait tre rejete parce que le refus de payer un acte mdical n'a pas t prononc en cours d'emploi. Dans la prsente affaire, le plaignant, en tant qu'employ des Forces armes canadiennes, a demand qu'un acte mdical pour son pouse soit pay. Par consquent, selon l'intime, le plaignant ne s'est pas vu refuser la prestation de soins par son employeur dans le cadre de sa relation d'emploi, mais plutt il y a eu un refus d'tendre le paiement des actes mdicaux pour l'pouse du plaignant.\n[31] Puis, l'intime prtend que suivant le rgime lgislatif prcdemment dcrit, une personne qui n'est pas membre n'est pas admissible aux soins de sant assurs par son rgime et que, tant donn que les soins taient demands pour une personne qui n'est pas membre, la prsente plainte n'a pas de lien avec une distinction fonde sur l'emploi.\n[32] L'intime soutient en outre que la demande suivant l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne devrait tre rejete parce que le rgime des services de sant et la politique l'gard de la Gamme de soins garantis s'y attachant ne privent pas le plaignant ou tout autre employ d'une chance d'emploi. Selon l'intime, la prestation de services et de soins de sant n'est pas une chance d'emploi selon la dfinition de la Loi. Elle ajoute que les chances d'emploi sont des faons selon lesquelles un employ est engag, promu et form dans l'organisation. L'intime prtend que le but de l'article 10 est d'empcher des employeurs d'avoir des pratiques ou des politiques discriminatoires qui ont un effet sur la faon selon laquelle ils engagent et forment des employs ou leur accordent des promotions.\nIV. LES PRTENTIONS DE LA COMMISSION [33] Selon la Commission, les prtentions de l'intime ne tiennent pas compte de la gravit et de la complexit de la plainte. L'intime omet de tenir compte du fait que la plainte provient du sergent Buffett, un membre des Forces armes canadiennes, et non de son pouse. Le plaignant prtend qu'il a fait l'objet de discrimination compte tenu de l'application faite par l'intime des dispositions de son Rgime de soins de sant. Selon la Commission, la plainte soulve une foule d'autres questions qui vont au-del de la seule question du paiement d'un acte mdical.\n[34] La Commission prtend que le Tribunal ne devrait pas rejeter la prsente plainte sans avoir tenu une audience et que la demande de rejet de la plainte prsente par l'intime ne satisfait pas au critre nonc dans des dcisions antrieures dans lesquelles le Tribunal a dclar qu'il devrait exercer sa comptence de rejeter une plainte seulement dans les [TRADUCTION] cas les plus clairs .\n[35] Bien que les parties se soient entendues sur certains faits aux fins de la prsente audience prliminaire, la Commission soutient qu'elles ont de plus convenu qu'elles pourraient exposer de faon dtaille ces faits lors de l'audition complte de l'affaire.\n[36] Les questions souleves par le plaignant sont, selon la Commission, actuelles et complexes. Elles ne peuvent tre troitement rsumes la question de savoir si l'pouse du plaignant doit bnficier de la protection offerte par le rgime de soins de sant. La Commission sollicite par consquent le rejet de la demande prsente par l'intime.\nV. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE DANS LA REQUTE PRLIMINAIRE [37] Dans sa requte prliminaire, l'intime demande que la plainte soit rejete pour les motifs suivants :\n[TRADUCTION]\nson refus de payer l'acte mdical ne constituait pas un refus de fournir un avantage en matire d'emploi fond sur l'un des motifs numrs l'article 7 de la Loi; le plaignant ne peut pas tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination; la prestation de soins de sant assurs n'est pas une pratique ou une politique d'emploi se rapportant des chances d'emploi et n'est pas, par consquent, vise par l'article 10 de la Loi.\nVI. LA DCISION [38] Les paragraphes 49(1) et 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne prvoient ce qui suit :\n49(1) La Commission peut, toute tape postrieure au dpt de la plainte, demander au prsident du Tribunal de dsigner un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives celle-ci, que l'instruction est justifie.\n50(1) Le membre instructeur, aprs avis conforme la Commission, aux parties et, son apprciation, tout intress, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a t dsign; il donne ceux-ci la possibilit pleine et entire de comparatre et de prsenter, en personne ou par l'intermdiaire d'un avocat, des lments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[39] Prenant en compte l'obligation nonce dans la Loi selon laquelle il faut donner aux parties la possibilit pleine et entire de comparatre lors de l'instruction et de prsenter des lments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations, le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il devrait exercer de faon prudente sa comptence de rejeter une plainte une tape prliminaire. Comme l'a dclar mon collgue Paul Groarke dans la dcision Cremasco c. Socit canadienne des postes, (2002-09-30 - Dcision sur requte no 1), au paragraphe 83 : Le fait de brimer le droit des plaignants une audience porterait atteinte la nature rparatrice de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui permet une interprtation large et librale .\n[40] Par consquent, je partage l'opinion de mon collgue selon laquelle le pouvoir du Tribunal de rejeter une affaire une tape prliminaire ne devrait tre exerc que dans les [TRADUCTION] cas les plus clairs . La situation est-elle diffrente si les parties se sont entendues sur certains faits aux fins de la requte? Je ne le crois pas tant donn que les parties ont admis elles-mmes qu'elles pourraient exposer de faon dtaille ces faits lors de l'audition de la plainte.\n[41] Lors de l'audition de la requte, les parties et le Tribunal ont chang les propos qui suivent :\n[TRADUCTION]\nM. PAGOWSKI : Je ferais seulement une autre observation. Cela rsulte seulement de quelque chose que mon amie a dit. Cela ne se rapporte pas au fond.\nLE PRSIDENT : Non.\nM. PAGOWSKI : Mon amie et moi avons chang de la correspondance. Je suis certain qu'elle serait d'accord avec moi cet gard - nous avons chang de la correspondance sur la question des faits qui auraient donn lieu la prsente requte particulire et nous avons convenu que - que ces faits - les faits pourraient trs bien tre exposs de faon dtaille au moment o nous serons l'tape de l'audience devant le Tribunal. Alors seulement aux fins de cette -\nMME RICHARDS : Oui.\nLE PRSIDENT : Parce que j'ai effectivement compris cela lors de la dernire confrence tlphonique, lorsque j'ai dit que je pensais que les parties s'taient entendues sur tous les faits et que vous avez mentionn tous deux que vous exposeriez de faon dtaille les faits s'il y avait une audience.\nMME RICHARDS : C'est tout fait cela et je n'avais pas l'intention de vous induire en erreur cet gard.\nLE PRSIDENT : Non, je comprends cela.\n[42] Les points soulevs par l'intime dans sa requte sont de faon certaine trs importants. Ils soulvent d'importantes questions d'intrt public qui pourraient avoir des consquences bien au-del de la prsente plainte. Pour tre juste envers les parties, le Tribunal est d'avis que ces points devraient tre traits lors d'une audition complte de l'affaire au cours de laquelle les parties auront la possibilit de prsenter leurs lments de preuve et leurs observations sur les points de droit. Il ne serait pas dans l'intrt fondamental des parties en cause que ces questions soient traites de faon expditive titre de requte prliminaire et certainement pas alors que tous les faits n'ont pas t prsents.\n[43] La requte prliminaire prsente par l'intime est rejete et l'affaire sera entendue lors d'une audience complte sur le bien-fond. Les parties fourniront sur le champ au Tribunal les dates auxquelles elles sont disponibles pour une audience d'une dure d'une semaine au mois de mai ou juin 2005. De plus, elles changeront et dposeront auprs du Tribunal une liste dfinitive de leurs tmoins avec un rsum de la preuve que ces tmoins prsenteront lors de l'audience. Les parties se conformeront en outre aux Rgles de procdure du Tribunal se rapportant la preuve d'expert, le cas chant. Le Tribunal est en outre disponible pour traiter de toute question rsultant de la prsente dcision ou de toute autre question que les parties voudraient soulever avant l'audience.\nMichel Doucet\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 21 mars 2005\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T976\/9604\nINTITUL DE LA CAUSE : Terry Buffett c.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\nI. LES FAITS\nII. ANALYSE\n[1] L'intim\u00e9, le Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations (le Mus\u00e9e), a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire par laquelle il demande au Tribunal de rejeter la plainte pour ce qui est de l'all\u00e9gation de manquement \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi. Subsidiairement, le Mus\u00e9e sollicite une ordonnance obligeant la plaignante, l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396) (le syndicat), \u00e0 fournir des renseignements pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa plainte en vertu de l'article 11.\nI. LES FAITS [2] Le 6 mars 2000, le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) par laquelle il pr\u00e9tend que le Mus\u00e9e utilise un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois qui comporte des failles et qui entra\u00eene la sous-r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des emplois occup\u00e9s par des femmes par rapport aux emplois de valeur comparable occup\u00e9s par des hommes, en contravention des articles 10 et 11 de la Loi. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal le 1er avril 2004.\n[3] Les employ\u00e9s du Mus\u00e9e \u00e9taient \u00e0 un certain moment classifi\u00e9s selon la Norme du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, qui classait les emplois dans divers groupes professionnels incluant les groupes CR et GT. On all\u00e8gue dans la plainte que le groupe CR \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et que le groupe GT \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9dominante d'emplois occup\u00e9s par des hommes. Le 1er avril 1997, le Mus\u00e9e a mis en application un nouveau plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Le syndicat pr\u00e9tend que le plan d\u00e9favorise les emplois occup\u00e9s par des femmes par rapport aux emplois de m\u00eame valeur occup\u00e9s par des hommes. Certains facteurs qui sont reconnus comme servant \u00e0 mesurer les aspects des emplois qui sont typiquement f\u00e9minins sont soi-disant absents du plan et inversement d'autres facteurs qui favorisent typiquement des emplois occup\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9dominante par des hommes sont pris en compte dans le plan.\n[4] Une caract\u00e9ristique int\u00e9ressante du nouveau plan est que les emplois ne sont plus class\u00e9s en groupes professionnels. Plut\u00f4t, chaque emploi est \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement et, d\u00e9pendamment de sa cotation num\u00e9rique, on lui attribue l'un des diff\u00e9rents niveaux. L'\u00e9chelle de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration augmente en proportion du niveau attribu\u00e9.\n[5] Le formulaire de plainte contient une table qui est cens\u00e9e d\u00e9montrer qu'apr\u00e8s la conversion au nouveau plan, les emplois de toutes les personnes qui occupent des postes classifi\u00e9s CR, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9s entre les niveaux 2 et 4, alors que seulement 16,7 % des emplois classifi\u00e9s GT, qui sont occup\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9dominante par des hommes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9s au niveau 4 ou moins. Les emplois des autres employ\u00e9s occupant des postes classifi\u00e9s GT ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9s entre les niveaux 5 et 8 et 43 % de ces emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9s au niveau 6. Le salaire le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 du niveau 4 (comme le mentionne la table) \u00e9tait de 37 737,82 $, alors que le salaire maximal au niveau 6 \u00e9tait de 49 111,11 $.\n[6] Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte que la partialit\u00e9 pour les hommes illustr\u00e9e par ces r\u00e9sultats a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par une \u00e9valuation effectu\u00e9e au hasard relativement \u00e0 un ensemble de sept emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et de sept emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, \u00e9valuation qui utilisait un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois [TRADUCTION] non sexiste \u00e9labor\u00e9 conjointement par l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (l'AFPC) et Deloitte & Touche. Les r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9montrent soi-disant que deux emplois f\u00e9minins qui \u00e9taient cot\u00e9s \u00e0 un niveau \u00e9gal \u00e0 deux emplois masculins suivant le nouveau plan de l'employeur \u00e9taient cot\u00e9s \u00e0 un niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que les emplois masculins lorsqu'ils \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s suivant le plan [TRADUCTION] non sexiste. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, l'examen effectu\u00e9 a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que trois emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, qui suivant le nouveau plan \u00e9taient cot\u00e9s \u00e0 un niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de trois emplois f\u00e9minins, ont re\u00e7u suivant le plan [TRADUCTION] non sexiste une cote \u00e9quivalente ou l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des emplois f\u00e9minins.\n[7] Il est important de remarquer ici que le formulaire de plainte ne mentionne pas quels emplois ont fait l'objet de cette \u00e9valuation effectu\u00e9e au hasard. De plus, le syndicat ne mentionne pas quels emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine sont sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s lorsqu'on les compare \u00e0 des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Cette pr\u00e9tendue omission dans la plainte est au cur de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Mus\u00e9e.\n[8] Le Mus\u00e9e signale que bien qu'il y ait dans la plainte une certaine mention des emplois classifi\u00e9s CR et GT, ces classifications ont cess\u00e9 d'exister le 1er avril 1997. L'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 se rapporte au nouveau plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois suivant lequel il n'y a pas de r\u00e9partition par groupes professionnels.\n[9] Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que sans une particularisation du groupe plaignant f\u00e9minin et du groupe masculin comparatif, la pr\u00e9tention de discrimination faite par le syndicat en vertu de l'article 11 ne peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e, en particulier lorsque l'on tient compte de l'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, DORS\/86-1082 (l'Ordonnance), adopt\u00e9e suivant le paragraphe 27(2) de la Loi. Selon l'article 12 de l'Ordonnance, lorsqu'une plainte qui all\u00e8gue des diff\u00e9rences de salaire est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un groupe professionnel identifiable ou en son nom, les membres du groupe doivent \u00eatre de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9dominante d'un sexe et le groupe auquel il est compar\u00e9 doit \u00eatre compos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9dominante de l'autre sexe. Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que pour qu'une demande respecte cette disposition, le groupe plaignant et le groupe comparatif doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9s.\n[10] Le Mus\u00e9e soutient que la pr\u00e9sente plainte ne respecte pas l'Ordonnance parce qu'elle n'identifie pas le groupe professionnel plaignant et le groupe professionnel comparatif. De plus, l'employeur pr\u00e9tend que cette omission constitue un d\u00e9ni de son droit de conna\u00eetre les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contre lesquels il doit se d\u00e9fendre et un manquement aux exigences minimales en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[11] Le Mus\u00e9e, au fil des ans, a fait conna\u00eetre de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e au syndicat et \u00e0 la Commission ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du manque de particularisation de ces groupes professionnels. Une premi\u00e8re mention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard se retrouve dans la r\u00e9ponse initiale du Mus\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte, r\u00e9ponse communiqu\u00e9e aux autres parties en juin 2000. Les m\u00eames appr\u00e9hensions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es aussi r\u00e9cemment qu'en ao\u00fbt 2004 dans un expos\u00e9 sommaire de la cause d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le Mus\u00e9e en pr\u00e9paration d'une conf\u00e9rence portant sur la gestion de la cause. Le Mus\u00e9e mentionne qu'\u00e0 aucun moment au cours de l'instance il n'a re\u00e7u du syndicat ou de la Commission les renseignements demand\u00e9s. Un rapport d'expert obtenu par la Commission (le rapport Haigni\u00e8re), communiqu\u00e9 en juin 2003, examinait la question de savoir si la nouvelle classification tendait \u00e0 priver les femmes de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi, en violation de l'article 10 de la Loi. Les conclusions de ce rapport ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9es dans le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission. Selon le Mus\u00e9e, ni l'expert ni l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission n'ont examin\u00e9 la question de la contravention \u00e0 l'article 11 ou n'ont signal\u00e9 une telle contravention. Le rapport de l'expert a examin\u00e9 effectivement plusieurs emplois particuliers, qui \u00e9taient identifi\u00e9s comme emplois f\u00e9minins ou masculins, mais il n'y a pas eu de comparaison effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des valeurs de ces emplois ou des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration relatifs. Le rapport d'enqu\u00eate a recommand\u00e9 qu'un tribunal soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour instruire la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 11, mais n'a pas \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le groupe plaignant et le groupe comparatif.\n[12] Le syndicat quant \u00e0 lui a mentionn\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 sommaire de la cause dat\u00e9 du 9 juillet 2004 qu'il s'appuyait [TRADUCTION] sur les groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine comme ils sont d\u00e9finis selon les appellations d'emploi et les points communs des fonctions et responsabilit\u00e9s. Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que cette d\u00e9claration ne lui a fourni aucun autre aper\u00e7u quant \u00e0 l'identification du groupe plaignant et du groupe comparatif.\n[13] La question a surgi de nouveau au cours de la conf\u00e9rence portant sur la gestion de la cause qui a suivi et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal le 20 ao\u00fbt 2004. \u00c0 la suite de certaines discussions, le Mus\u00e9e s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer aux autres parties les [TRADUCTION] pond\u00e9rations des facteurs et les [TRADUCTION] \u00e9chelles de pond\u00e9ration des sous-facteurs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es lors de la mise en application du nouveau plan de classification des emplois. L'avocat du syndicat avait expliqu\u00e9 lors de la conf\u00e9rence que sans ces renseignements, il serait difficile pour sa cliente de fournir une particularisation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des groupes. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u ces renseignements, l'avocat du syndicat a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat du Mus\u00e9e une lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 octobre 2004 [TRADUCTION] dans un effort visant \u00e0 clarifier la position de la plaignante quant au groupe plaignant et au groupe comparatif aux fins de la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 11. Il a ensuite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 dans sa lettre onze [TRADUCTION] groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et neuf [TRADUCTION] groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Lors de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, tenue le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2005, l'avocat du syndicat a expliqu\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration. Il a confirm\u00e9 la position du syndicat selon laquelle, sous r\u00e9serve de changements dans les donn\u00e9es, chacun des groupes f\u00e9minins \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s constitue un groupe plaignant distinct \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la liste combin\u00e9e des groupes professionnels masculins comprend un seul groupe comparatif masculin, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 14 de l'Ordonnance. L'article 14 pr\u00e9voit que lorsque la comparaison est faite avec deux groupes professionnels ou plus, ces groupes sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un seul groupe.\n[14] Le Mus\u00e9e signale que les emplois \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la lettre du 15 octobre ne correspondent \u00e0 aucune autre \u00e9num\u00e9ration d'emplois faite ant\u00e9rieurement. En particulier, l'examen effectu\u00e9 par l'AFPC et Deloitte & Touche \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du nouveau plan qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte se rapportait \u00e0 un ensemble d'emplois diff\u00e9rent. Les professions d\u00e9nombr\u00e9es dans l'annexe jointe au rapport Haigni\u00e8re ne correspondent pas non plus \u00e0 celles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la nouvelle liste. D'ailleurs, il semblerait que la liste dat\u00e9e du 15 octobre ne correspond m\u00eame pas \u00e0 l'analyse des emplois comme ils sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les anciennes classifications CR et GT. Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que, en fait, le syndicat tente maintenant de modifier sa plainte.\n[15] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 11, par son omission d'identifier le groupe plaignant et le groupe comparatif, ne respecte pas l'Ordonnance et est par cons\u00e9quent [TRADUCTION] invalide. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu'il ne sait pas ce qu'il doit d\u00e9montrer et que le fait d'exiger qu'il r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 la plainte constituerait un manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 fondamentale et \u00e0 la justice naturelle. Subsidiairement, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que l'incorporation des appelations d'emplois dans la plainte au moyen de la lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 octobre \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une modification inadmissible de la plainte en raison du pr\u00e9judice qui en r\u00e9sulte pour le Mus\u00e9e. En outre, le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la plainte, comme elle est [TRADUCTION] modifi\u00e9e par la lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 octobre, constitue fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte qui n'est pas celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire cette [TRADUCTION] nouvelle plainte.\nII. ANALYSE [16] J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter la pr\u00e9misse selon laquelle la plainte est [TRADUCTION] invalide. La plainte expose un ensemble de faits qui constituent pr\u00e9tendument de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Il ne peut y avoir de doutes, apr\u00e8s avoir lu le texte, quant \u00e0 ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Dit simplement, on pr\u00e9tend que le Mus\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 en 1997 un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois qui en soi \u00e9tait fondamentalement sexiste dans sa formulation et son application. Ces pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s sexistes ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la sous-\u00e9valuation des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine lorsqu'ils sont compar\u00e9s aux emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Afin de prouver ces pr\u00e9tentions, il est clair que la Commission et le syndicat devront \u00e9tablir qu'il existe des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s sexistes dans le plan et qu'ils ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la sous-\u00e9valuation des emplois f\u00e9minins. Quant au redressement, il faudra d\u00e9montrer que compte tenu de cette sous-\u00e9valuation, les salaires des personnes qui occupent ces emplois f\u00e9minins \u00e9taient moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s qu'ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 si un plan impartial avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9. Une compensation pour cet [TRADUCTION] \u00e9cart de salaire devrait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e. C'est essentiellement ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte. Il appartient au syndicat et \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve et d'\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[17] Un ensemble de faits donn\u00e9 pourrait en th\u00e9orie constituer une violation de plus d'une des dispositions de la Loi. Par exemple, une pratique d'un employeur qui priverait un employ\u00e9 d'une possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi sur le fondement d'un motif illicite (une violation de l'article 10) pourrait en m\u00eame temps avoir un effet d\u00e9favorable sur cet employ\u00e9 (une violation de l'article 7). Dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre le syndicat et la Commission avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il y avait en fait une certaine discussion quant \u00e0 savoir si la demande devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e suivant l'article 7, 10, ou 11 de la Loi.\n[18] Dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Robinson, [1994] 3 C.F. 228, aux paragraphes 37 \u00e0 39, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a mentionn\u00e9 qu'un Tribunal, lors de son instruction, ne devrait pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration dans la plainte des dispositions de la Loi qui ont soi-disant \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es. L'affaire soumise \u00e0 la Cour dans cet arr\u00eat se rapportait \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision par laquelle le Tribunal avait conclu que l'une des politiques de l'intim\u00e9e violait l'article 10 de la Loi. Toutefois, la plainte n'avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'une violation de l'article 7. La Cour a statu\u00e9 que ce fait n'\u00e9tait pas pertinent et a mentionn\u00e9 que les formulaires de plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ne doivent pas \u00eatre scrut\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un acte d'accusation en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Ce qui \u00e9tait important pour la Cour \u00e9tait que les faits soumis au Tribunal d\u00e9montraient que la politique \u00e9tait discriminatoire, que ce soit en contravention de l'article 7 ou de l'article 10.\n[19] Le motif justifiant la d\u00e9cision de ne pas adopter une m\u00e9thode trop restrictive ou technique lors de l'examen des formulaires de plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal dans l'affaire Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [2005] TCDP 1, au paragraphe 10. Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 que le formulaire de plainte existe principalement aux fins de la Commission. Il est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire qui soul\u00e8ve une s\u00e9rie de faits qui requi\u00e8rent une enqu\u00eate plus \u00e0 fond. Le formulaire est approximatif en soi et il n'a jamais eu pour but de servir aux fins d'une plaidoirie dans le processus adjudicatif qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une audience. C'est l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (habituellement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal) plut\u00f4t que la plainte originale qui expose les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l'audience.\n[20] Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, le syndicat a fourni des renseignements additionnels, non seulement au moyen de son expos\u00e9 sommaire de la cause pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en pr\u00e9paration de la conf\u00e9rence portant sur la gestion de la cause du mois d'ao\u00fbt 2004, mais aussi, de fa\u00e7on plus importante, au moyen de la lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 octobre 2004. L'avocat du syndicat a expliqu\u00e9 plus \u00e0 fond ces pr\u00e9cisions dans ses observations faites de vive voix relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. \u00c0 mon avis, ces renseignements additionnels compl\u00e8tent les renseignements qui, selon ce que le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend, n'\u00e9taient pas complets dans le formulaire de plainte se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11. Le fait d'ordonner au syndicat et \u00e0 la Commission de fournir toute autre pr\u00e9cision irait au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est requis aux fins de la plaidoirie. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision AFPC c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (ministre du Personnel), [2000] D.C.D.P. no 9, au paragraphe 7 (TCDP), les parties sont tenues d'exposer uniquement les faits essentiels sur lesquels elles se fonderont dans leur plaidoyer - elles n'ont pas \u00e0 plaider la preuve. Je suis convaincu que les renseignements donn\u00e9s au Mus\u00e9e sont suffisants pour qu'il sache ce qu'il doit d\u00e9montrer. Je suis en outre convaincu que les renseignements fournis ne constituent pas une modification \u00e0 la plainte originale, mais qu'ils constituent simplement d'autres pr\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte existante.\n[21] Cependant, l'affaire ne s'arr\u00eate pas l\u00e0. Ces pr\u00e9cisions n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies qu'assez r\u00e9cemment. La lettre du 15 octobre 2004 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite environ six mois apr\u00e8s que l'affaire eut \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal et la clarification d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des groupes plaignants f\u00e9minins a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite quatre mois plus tard lors de l'audition de la requ\u00eate. La question, par cons\u00e9quent, est celle de savoir si le Mus\u00e9e subit d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre un pr\u00e9judice du fait que la divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape du processus.\n[22] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate, le Mus\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il [TRADUCTION] subirait un pr\u00e9judice important s'il \u00e9tait tenu \u00e0 une audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qu'il d\u00e9crivait comme [TRADUCTION] de nouvelles all\u00e9gations. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, je ne consid\u00e8re pas les renseignements fournis au Mus\u00e9e depuis le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal comme de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, mais plut\u00f4t comme d'autres pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte existante. En tenant pour acquis que ces renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s relativement tardivement, quel est le pr\u00e9judice subi par le Mus\u00e9e?\n[23] Le Mus\u00e9e a soutenu dans ses observations \u00e9crites que l'avancement de l'instruction de cette plainte serait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre retard\u00e9. Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait certain de quelle fa\u00e7on ce serait le cas. Le Mus\u00e9e aura-t-il besoin de plus de temps pour pr\u00e9parer sa cause? Les dates d'audience et de divulgation n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies. Il est donc probable que nous sommes encore \u00e0 plusieurs mois de l'ouverture de l'instruction. Le Mus\u00e9e devrait par cons\u00e9quent avoir assez de temps pour se pr\u00e9parer. En outre, les avocats du syndicat et de la Commission ont expos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on plut\u00f4t \u00e9vidente qu'au d\u00e9but leur preuve consistera \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence de sexisme dans le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois actuel. La Commission a m\u00eame sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de bifurquer la cause de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 traiter cette question dans son ensemble avant de passer \u00e0 la question secondaire qui consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence d'un \u00e9cart salarial. Que la bifurcation de la cause ait lieu ou non, il est n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9vident que les questions soulev\u00e9es en raison de l'application de l'Ordonnance ne seront pas soumises au Tribunal avant un certain temps. Si le Mus\u00e9e a besoin de plus de temps pour pr\u00e9parer sa cause, il est assur\u00e9ment libre de demander au Tribunal un certain accommodement raisonnable quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier. De toute fa\u00e7on, je ne vois pas comment le Mus\u00e9e subit un pr\u00e9judice.\n[24] Le Mus\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il subissait en outre un pr\u00e9judice du fait qu'on lui ait refus\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s aux processus d'enqu\u00eate et de conciliation de la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qu'il consid\u00e8re comme de [TRADUCTION] nouvelles all\u00e9gations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'article 11. Cependant, comme je l'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9, les pr\u00e9cisions fournies ne sont pas de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, mais seulement des pr\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte existante.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de non-lieu.\n[2] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant aux deux plaintes proviennent tous de la plaignante.\n[3] Dans sa premi\u00e8re plainte, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la bande n'a pris aucune mesure d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard lorsqu'elle est revenue de son traitement contre le cancer. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle ne lui a pas permis de travailler \u00e0 demi-temps. Ensuite, il y a la question financi\u00e8re. Et la question de la dignit\u00e9. Elle affirme que la bande ne disposait pas du processus n\u00e9cessaire pour la ramener sur le march\u00e9 du travail. Elle affirme qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e avec compassion.\n[4] Il y a des difficult\u00e9s sur le plan financier \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante a accept\u00e9 des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es pour cause d'invalidit\u00e9 totale. Toutefois, si je comprends bien son t\u00e9moignage, elle affirme qu'elle n'a accept\u00e9 ces paiements qu'apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut abandonn\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e de retourner travailler, de fa\u00e7on graduelle, \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[5] Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu'on a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle. Les deux parties conviennent que leurs relations se sont d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es progressivement. Mme Schulyer attribut cela \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Elle affirme qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ce genre de situation auparavant. Elle affirme que la bande n'aimait pas se faire poursuivre.\n[6] Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent je ne dispose que du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Schulyer. Toute preuve de repr\u00e9sailles est une question d'inf\u00e9rence. Toutefois, selon elle, il s'agit d'une situation simple. Lorsqu'elle a refus\u00e9 de retirer sa plainte, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ostracis\u00e9e. Il y a peut-\u00eatre eu d'autres facteurs, mais ce fut l\u00e0 le facteur essentiel. La situation s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e et elle a \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[7] L'opinion de Mme Schulyer quant \u00e0 la situation peut ou peut ne pas \u00eatre la bonne opinion. Il m'est tr\u00e8s difficile de me prononcer l\u00e0-dessus sans entendre l'intim\u00e9e. La bande a d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9 la position que le probl\u00e8me provenait de Mme Schulyer, et ce, en rapport avec l'ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches. Je suis toutefois oblig\u00e9 de surseoir \u00e0 mon jugement jusqu'\u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de l'affaire. Ce n'est toutefois pas le temps de choisir entre les deux parties.\n[8] En vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, les repr\u00e9sailles constituent une forme de discrimination. La preuve de discrimination est souvent indirecte. Les intim\u00e9s admettent rarement ouvertement qu'ils ont agi d'une fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers un plaignant. Je crois que les conclusions de Mme Schulyer m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre examin\u00e9es. Elle connaissait la bande et le conseil et on ne peut pas s'attendre \u00e0 ce qu'elle fournisse une preuve directe des motivations de l'employeur.\n[9] La seule question qui se pose dans un non-lieu est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si on est saisi d'une preuve qui appelle une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Je crois que c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[10] Je ne dis pas qu'il s'agit en l'esp\u00e8ce d'une preuve irr\u00e9futable. Il peut y avoir des difficult\u00e9s avec la preuve. Ce n'est cependant pas le temps de parler de ce genre de questions. La seule question que l'on doit se poser est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si on doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une preuve compl\u00e8te.\n[11] Dans les circonstances, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e. Il existe une preuve prima facie. C'est l'intim\u00e9e qui doit d\u00e9cider si elle veut pr\u00e9senter une preuve.\nM.

R\u00e9parations additionnelles\nIV. Ordonnance\nI. Introduction [1] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour obtenir la suspension ou le rejet de la plainte en se fondant sur la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e. L\u2019avis de requ\u00eate mentionne que la cause a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue en vertu de la partie III du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, ch. L-2. Il en d\u00e9coule que la question dont le Tribunal est saisi a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e.\n[2] Les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte sont relativement simples. Mme Toth a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 2000. Elle a par la suite subi un traitement de f\u00e9condation in vitro, puis elle est tomb\u00e9e enceinte. Elle pr\u00e9tend que M. Aylward, le pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle prenne un cong\u00e9 de maladie et un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 en raison de ce traitement.\n[3] En 2002, Mme Toth a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116, pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet de discrimination. Son poste fut aboli l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. On a ensuite modifi\u00e9 la plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour y ajouter la cessation d\u2019emploi.\n[4] Il ne s\u2019agit l\u00e0 que de la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire. Il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mme Toth a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu du Code canadien du travail, pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement injuste. Une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue en avril 2004. L\u2019arbitre a conclu que Mme Toth avait \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement cong\u00e9di\u00e9e et a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de lui payer son salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis.\n[5] La requ\u00eate dont je suis saisi s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e par voie de voir-dire. Les deux parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit : un affidavit soumis par M. Salveta, un conseiller en ressources humaines qui a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail et un affidavit soumis par la plaignante. Il y a eu un contre\u2011interrogatoire au sujet des affidavits. Mme Toth a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion que l\u2019attitude de M. Aylward \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa grossesse \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment central lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail.\n[6] M. Taylor a comparu pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instance sont identiques \u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre en vertu du Code canadien du travail. \u00c0 son avis, la question essentielle dans l\u2019audition de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail \u00e9tait de savoir si Mme Toth avait fait l\u2019objet de discrimination parce qu\u2019elle avait subi un traitement de f\u00e9condation in vitro et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e enceinte. C\u2019est de cette question dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[7] M. Verbanac a comparu pour la plaignante. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail, on a trait\u00e9 des questions financi\u00e8res et des questions d\u2019emploi. On n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 des questions relatives \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cela semble peu convaincant. M. Taylor me renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante dans lequel on mentionne que l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la plaignante devant le Tribunal suivra une formule analogue \u00e0 l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant l\u2019arbitre.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il peut y avoir des cas o\u00f9 des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es en vertu du Code canadien du travail et des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de personne concernant la perte d\u2019emploi peuvent faire l\u2019objet de distinction. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, toutefois, elle pr\u00e9tend que la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 gagn\u00e9 sa cause. On aurait tort de la laisser s\u2019adresser au Tribunal et de tenter d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9parations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nII. La doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e A. La cause satisfait-elle au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Danyluk? [9] Selon la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e, les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires ont \u00e0 tout le moins un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif. Elles peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 tous. Cette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue au contexte administratif et elle est maintenant d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le volet particulier de la doctrine qui semble s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 la pr\u00e9clusion fond\u00e9e sur la cause d\u2019action. On pr\u00e9tend essentiellement que la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue. Elle ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue une autre fois.\n[10] M. Taylor et M. Verbanac ont convenu que trois conditions doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies pour que l\u2019on puisse faire intervenir la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e. Ces conditions sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc. [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460, page 477. Elles sont les suivantes :\nla partie qui invoque la doctrine doit d\u00e9montrer que la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure est finale; elle doit d\u00e9montrer que les parties sont les m\u00eames et elle doit d\u00e9montrer que la m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e.\n(i) La d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait finale [11] La plaignante accepte que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait finale. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est toutefois pas convaincue de cela et invoque l\u2019article 243 du Code canadien du travail. Cet article est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n243(1) Les ordonnances de l\u2019arbitre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 242(1) sont d\u00e9finitives et non susceptibles de recours judiciaires.\n(2) Il n\u2019est admis aucun recours ou d\u00e9cision judiciaire, notamment par voie d\u2019injonction, de certiorari, de prohibition ou de quo warranto, visant \u00e0 contester, r\u00e9viser, emp\u00eacher ou limiter l\u2019action d\u2019un arbitre exerc\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019article 242.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que je ne peux pas r\u00e9examiner les questions examin\u00e9es par l\u2019arbitre sans contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 par cette disposition.\n(ii) Les parties sont les m\u00eames [12] L\u2019avocat de la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue quant \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Il en d\u00e9coule que les parties aux deux audiences ne sont pas les m\u00eames.\n[13] M. Verbanac invoque la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Parisien c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale Ottawa-Carleton, TCDP T699\/0402 (15 juillet 2002), dans laquelle le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, laquelle a comparu \u00e0 l\u2019instruction sur les droits de la personne, n\u2019avait pas particip\u00e9 au processus de grief. Le Tribunal a conclu que la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s\u2019appliquait pas.\n[14] Le Tribunal, dans Parisien, a reconnu que le processus en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne fait appel \u00e0 des droits fondamentaux qui vont au\u2011del\u00e0 des droits priv\u00e9s des parties. Cela peut avoir une incidence sur d\u2019autres causes. J\u2019ai toutefois affaire \u00e0 des faits forts diff\u00e9rents. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, laquelle repr\u00e9sente l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, n\u2019a pas comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[15] Il y a une complication. Bien que la Commission e\u00fbt inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 dire dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate, elle continue d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019elle est toujours partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction. Je crois que la fa\u00e7on de se sortir de cette difficult\u00e9 est de reconna\u00eetre que les termes juridiques ont une certaine souplesse. La Commission est peut\u2011\u00eatre partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction \u00e0 certaines fins mais pas \u00e0 certaines autres. Je suis toutefois convaincu qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas partie aux fins de d\u00e9terminer si la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e s\u2019applique.\n[16] Il s\u2019agit en fin de compte d\u2019une question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. L\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par la question de d\u00e9terminer si la Commission est partie dans le contexte de la requ\u00eate imm\u00e9diate consiste surtout \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de traiter des questions en litige de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je ne vois pas comment on peut faire une telle affirmation dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances. Il s\u2019ensuit que les parties devant moi, aux fins de la chose jug\u00e9e, sont les m\u00eames parties qui ont comparu devant l\u2019arbitre lors de l\u2019audience de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail.\n(iii) La question est la m\u00eame [17] La question la plus difficile consiste \u00e0 savoir si la question dont le Tribunal est saisi est la m\u00eame que celle dont l\u2019arbitre a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi. M. Verbanac a pr\u00e9tendu que la question dont l\u2019arbitre a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019abolition du poste de la plaignante pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par des raisons li\u00e9es aux affaires et \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que cela ne fait que refl\u00e9ter la proc\u00e9dure intent\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail, lequel impose \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de justifier la cessation d\u2019emploi. Cela oblige l\u2019employeur \u00e0 parler le premier.\n[18] L\u2019arbitre, au premier paragraphe de sa d\u00e9cision arbitrale, \u00e9nonce la position prise par les deux parties lors de l\u2019audience de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail. Il a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] L\u2019employeur affirme que l\u2019emploi de Mme Toth a pris fin pour des raisons d\u2019affaires l\u00e9gitimes, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire en raison d\u2019une baisse des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et en raison du fait que ses anciennes t\u00e2ches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9parties entre le reste des employ\u00e9s. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu [Traduction] que la raison de la cessation de son emploi \u00e9tait que l\u2019employeur s\u2019opposait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle prenne un cong\u00e9 de maladie, puis un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9cond\u00e9e in vitro.\n[19] Il ressort de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre que la cause de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue en prenant pour acquis que l\u2019attitude de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa grossesse \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait incorrecte. La plaignante a pr\u00e9tendu que les raisons d\u2019affaires avanc\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9taient rien de plus qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pour justifier la cessation de son emploi. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un argument souvent invoqu\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[20] Il n\u2019existe pas de transcription de l\u2019audience de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail. Mme Toth a n\u00e9anmoins affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre que l\u2019attitude de M. Aylward avait chang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut appris qu\u2019elle subissait des traitements de fertilisation in vitro. Elle a convenu \u00e0 la barre que sa cause devant l\u2019arbitre portait uniquement sur sa grossesse ainsi que sur son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a dit M. Salveta l\u2019essentiel de sa position \u00e9tait que M. Aylward avait aboli son poste parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e enceinte.\n[21] Je ne pense pas qu\u2019il en soit autrement. La question de droit dont le Tribunal est saisi est de savoir si Mme Toth a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. La question de droit dont l\u2019arbitre \u00e9tait saisi \u00e9tait de savoir si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Ces deux questions se recoupent. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la conclusion que l\u2019attitude de M. Aylward \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la grossesse avait influenc\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019abolir son poste. Je crois que cela constitue une conclusion de discrimination.\n[22] Si Mme Toth a \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019arbitre \u00e9tait implicitement saisi de la m\u00eame question. Une d\u00e9cision rendue en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contredirait la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre. Il ne serait pas possible de conclure que le poste de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli \u00e0 bon droit sans contrevenir \u00e0 la clause privative \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 243 du Code canadien du travail.\n[23] La situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente s\u2019il y avait une all\u00e9gation distincte de harc\u00e8lement, laquelle pourrait \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9e de la cessation d\u2019emploi. Toutefois, les questions factuelles sous\u2011jacentes dans les deux audiences sont les m\u00eames. L\u2019arbitre a d\u00fb tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble du comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour tirer ses conclusions. Toute autre all\u00e9gation fait partie int\u00e9grale du comportement qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la cessation de l\u2019emploi. Tout cela va ensemble.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que la pr\u00e9sente instance est r\u00e9gie par le principe mentionn\u00e9 par la juge Abella dans Rasanen c. Rosemount Instruments Limited [1994] O.J. no 200 (C.A. Ont.). Le plaignant dans Rasanen avait demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de licenciement en vertu de la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi, L.R.O. 1980, ch. 137. Il a \u00e9galement intent\u00e9 une poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue par un arbitre en vertu de la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi, avant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire par le tribunal.\n[25] La juge Abella a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, lequel a conclu que le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e s\u2019appliquait. \u00c0 la page 278, elle \u00e9crit que la question en litige dans les deux instances ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on restrictive.\nJ\u2019estime que la question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019instance est la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure relative \u00e0 la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi : l\u2019employ\u00e9 a\u2011t\u2011il droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 en cas de licenciement par l\u2019employeur? Il est vrai que dans la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi, cette question est formul\u00e9e en des termes qui diff\u00e8rent de ceux que l\u2019on retrouve dans la common law. Mais l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence sur le plan de la qualification et du processus ne veut pas dire, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que les questions sont diff\u00e9rentes.\nJe suis conscient que les r\u00e9actions \u00e0 Rasanen ont \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu partag\u00e9es. Je crois n\u00e9anmoins que le m\u00eame raisonnement s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[26] Il y a une saine mesure de bon sens dans l\u2019analyse faite par la juge Abella. Le fait qu\u2019il y avait des diff\u00e9rences dans les deux instances n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminant. Les parties dans Rasanen ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de convoquer des t\u00e9moins, de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la position de l\u2019autre partie. La substance des all\u00e9gations \u00e9tait la m\u00eame. Cela suffisait pour faire intervenir le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e.\n[27] Je crois qu\u2019il y a probablement une exception concernant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, laquelle exception pourrait s\u2019appliquer dans une cause qui soul\u00e8ve des questions qui vont au\u2011del\u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des parties. Le Tribunal a implicitement reconnu cela en refusant d\u2019appliquer la doctrine lorsque la Commission des droits de la personne d\u00e9cide de compara\u00eetre. La pr\u00e9sente affaire ne soul\u00e8ve toutefois pas ce genre de questions et ressemble plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un litige priv\u00e9.\n[28] Le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Rasanen est qu\u2019une cause ne doit \u00eatre entendue qu\u2019une seule fois. On dit parfois qu\u2019une partie ne peut pas plaider par tranches. Si une audience ou un proc\u00e8s comporte des lacunes; ce probl\u00e8me peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9 par voie de r\u00e9vision ou d\u2019appel. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 que \u00e7a se termine. On aurait tort de laisser un plaignant recommencer de nouveau, simplement en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant une cause dans un autre r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif.\n[29] La plaignante a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des causes dans lesquelles les arbitres ont refus\u00e9 d\u2019entendre des all\u00e9gations de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement au motif que le plaignant disposait d\u2019un redressement possible en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je crois que la situation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est diff\u00e9rente. S\u2019il est clair, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but d\u2019une audience qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de d\u00e9poser une plainte en vertu d\u2019une autre loi, il est logique qu\u2019un arbitre refuse d\u2019entendre la cause. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la discrimination au cours d\u2019une audience qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue \u00e0 bon droit par l\u2019arbitre.\nIII. R\u00e9parations additionnelles [30] Cela ne permet pas de r\u00e9gler compl\u00e8tement le cas de la requ\u00eate. On a conclu dans la d\u00e9cision Danyluk qu\u2019il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment discr\u00e9tionnaire dans la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e. M\u00eame si les exigences techniques de la loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites, M. Verbanac pr\u00e9tend que la plaignante devrait avoir le droit de demander des r\u00e9parations additionnelles en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[31] Comme premi\u00e8re r\u00e9paration, la plaignante demande le paiement d\u2019une prime facultative. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question qui d\u00e9coule naturellement de la cessation de l\u2019emploi de Mme Toth. L\u2019arbitre a tranch\u00e9 explicitement cette question. Je ne vois pas comment je peux r\u00e9examiner cette question sans examiner le fond de sa d\u00e9cision, laquelle est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019article 243 du Code canadien du travail.\n[32] Ensuite il y a la question du pr\u00e9judice moral. M. Verbanac affirme que sa cliente n\u2019a droit \u00e0 aucune indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral en vertu du Code canadien du travail. M. Taylor ne souscrit pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Il m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 242(4) du Code canadien du travail, lequel accorde \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre le pouvoir d\u2019enjoindre \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de prendre toute autre mesure qu\u2019il juge \u00e9quitable de lui imposer et de nature \u00e0 contrebalancer les effets du cong\u00e9diement ou \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier. Ce libell\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s large.\n[33] M. Taylor m\u2019a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre de causes. Dans Greyeyes c. Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation, [2003] C.L.A.D. no 205, par exemple, au paragraphe 45, un arbitre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 par l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu des dispositions pertinentes du Code canadien du travail est de replacer le plaignant dans sa position ant\u00e9rieure. Il est mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 51 de cette d\u00e9cision que cela comprend un d\u00e9dommagement [Traduction] pour tout pr\u00e9judice psychologique subi suite \u00e0 un cong\u00e9diement ill\u00e9gal. Dans Papequash c. Key Indian Band, [2003] C.L.A.D. no 142, paragraphe 226, un arbitre a accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour [Traduction] souffrances morales.\n[34] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il s\u2019agit\u2011l\u00e0 de cas exceptionnels. M\u00eame si un arbitre a le pouvoir d\u2019accorder des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour souffrances mentales, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une forme de redressement exceptionnelle qui est rarement demand\u00e9e ou qui est rarement accord\u00e9e. Un arbitre n\u2019a pas le pouvoir explicite dont jouit le Tribunal dans ce domaine.\n[35] La plaignante a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9paration en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019indemniser un plaignant victime d\u2019un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce recours n\u2019existe manifestement pas en vertu du Code canadien du travail. On m\u2019a n\u00e9anmoins soumis de la jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la proposition que l\u2019attribution de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats punitifs est disponible en vertu de l\u2019article 242 du Code canadien du travail. Ces genres de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits par lord Devlin dans Rookes c. Barnard, [1964] A.C. 1129, [1964] 2 W.L.R. 269, [1964] 1 All E.R. 367 (H.L.), \u00e0 la page 1121. Je crois qu\u2019ils constituent une forme similaire de r\u00e9paration.\n[36] Il existe un chevauchement important dans les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par le Code canadien du travail et les r\u00e9parations que la plaignante demande en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019arbitre aurait pu indemniser la plaignante pour troubles \u00e9motionnels, ne fut\u2011ce qu\u2019en prorogeant la p\u00e9riode du salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis. Dans les circonstances, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019une plaignante a droit de demander des r\u00e9parations additionnelles au cours d\u2019une seconde audience en vertu d\u2019une autre loi. La r\u00e9paration additionnelle qui pourrait \u00eatre demand\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne suffit pas pour justifier la tenue d\u2019une seconde audience.\n[37] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision s\u2019applique naturellement aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une exception, dans les cas o\u00f9 on doit avoir recours \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration mettant en cause l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui n\u2019est pas disponible en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Toutefois, les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par la plaignante en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont personnelles et compensatoires. Elles ne mettent pas en cause l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et elle n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la cause de la sph\u00e8re du litige priv\u00e9.\n[38] Il existe d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations. Par exemple, il est important de souligner que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas droit aux d\u00e9pens en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je crois qu\u2019il serait injuste de l\u2019obliger \u00e0 subir la tenue d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me audience, \u00e0 ses frais, alors que l\u2019affaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par un autre tribunal.\n[39] Je ne vois aucune raison pour ne pas appliquer la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le fait qu\u2019il existe des diff\u00e9rences, voire des diff\u00e9rences importantes, dans les r\u00e9parations disponibles dans les diff\u00e9rents tribunaux, n\u2019est pas suffisant pour justifier la tenue d\u2019une seconde audience. La juge Abella a reconnu dans Rasanen que l\u2019on pouvait demander des [Traduction] r\u00e9parations \u00e9largies dans le cadre de la poursuite. Cela n\u2019avait pas d\u2019importance. Une partie n\u2019a droit qu\u2019\u00e0 un seul jugement.\n[40] Il est \u00e9vident que Mme Toth dispose d\u2019autres sources de redressement. Par exemple, elle aurait pu intenter une poursuite pour cong\u00e9diement abusif. Il semble clair qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas le droit de faire cela. Je crois qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e de le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. C\u2019est trop me demander que de conclure que le Tribunal peut, par l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre moyen, examiner la question de la cessation d\u2019emploi, malgr\u00e9 le fait que la cour ne peut pas le faire. Les causes cit\u00e9es par la plaignante sont diff\u00e9rentes quant aux faits.\nIV. Ordonnance [41] On me demande dans la requ\u00eate de surseoir \u00e0 la plainte ou de la rejeter. Je ne sais pas exactement en quoi consisterait un sursis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En outre, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la loi et il d\u00e9tient des pouvoirs limit\u00e9s. De plus, on m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui touchent, du moins implicitement le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la cause. Enfin, il y a le fait que la doctrine de la chose jug\u00e9e est fond\u00e9e sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions rendues par les tribunaux doivent avoir un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019estime que le mieux \u00e0 faire est de rejeter la plainte.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDr Paul Groarke Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 18 mai 2005\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T986\/10604\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Paulette Toth c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si Bell Canada a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant, M. Roger Virk, dans le cadre de son emploi \u00e0 Bell, en raison de son origine ethnique ou nationale et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement d\u00e9cider si le plaignant a fait l'objet de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Bell Canada et ce, en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[2] M. Virk pr\u00e9tend que Bell Canada, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et M. Ted Weich, en particulier, ont fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en janvier 2002 en ne le nommant pas directeur du projet Globe and Mail parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique et que M. Penno Makdessian a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui, \u00e0 la fin de 2003, en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[3] \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat. L'intim\u00e9e l'\u00e9tait. La Commission n'a pas comparu. Trois t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus : le plaignant, M. Virk, et, pour l'intim\u00e9e, M. Ted Weich et M. Penno Makdessian.\n[4] M. Weich a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 le 9 mai 2002 par Mme Incognito, la directrice en relations de travail chez Bell, de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Virk. Quant \u00e0 M. Makdessian, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la plainte en janvier 2003.\nII. LES FAITS A. Le travail de M. Virk chez Bell avant le projet Globe and Mail [5] M. Virk a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Bell Canada le 12 octobre 1993 comme adjoint au marketing direct. Avant de travailler chez Bell, M. Virk travaillait comme surveillant de district pour le compte d'une cha\u00eene de magasin d'appareils \u00e9lectroniques.\n[6] Le 7 juillet 1995, M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au poste d'adjoint au soutien. Par la suite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au poste de superviseur du soutien (associ\u00e9 principal 8). En date du 9 janvier 1998, ce titre a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 pour celui d'adjoint principal.\n[7] En d\u00e9cembre 1998, M. Ted Weich est devenu directeur adjoint au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs, laquelle fait partie du Centre de marketing direct (CMD). \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, M. Virk travaillait comme adjoint principal au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs. L'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de M. Weich, de trois directeurs des ventes et de cinq adjoints principaux qui relevaient des directeurs des ventes. Les adjoints principaux sont des employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s. Les directeurs des ventes sont des employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 la direction.\n[8] Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Virk, lorsqu'il travaillait chez Bell Canada et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il quitte, \u00e9tait couvert par la convention collective pour le personnel de bureau de l'ACET, par opposition \u00e0 la convention collective pour le personnel des ventes de l'ACET. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que, au sein du Centre de marketing direct, il existe deux types d'employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s qui peuvent obtenir des promotions, le personnel de bureau, en vertu de la convention collective pour le personnel de bureau, et le personnel des ventes, en vertu de la convention collective pour le personnel des ventes.\n[9] Selon la preuve, les postes de personnel de bureau, tels les adjoints principaux et les adjoints, sont principalement des postes de soutien. Les membres du personnel des ventes, tels les adjoints au marketing direct, sont des t\u00e9l\u00e9vendeurs. M. Virk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tous les adjoints principaux sont d'anciens adjoints au marketing direct et qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 adjoint au marketing direct.\n[10] Le 2 mai 2000, un poste de g\u00e9rant des partenariats strat\u00e9giques du CMD CP-2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9. M. Virk a postul\u00e9 pour ce poste. Dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Weich quelques jours avant l'envoi de sa demande, M. Virk a dit craindre que M. Weich puisse croire qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires en mati\u00e8re de vente pour occuper le poste de g\u00e9rant. Dans son courriel, M. Virk a fait ressortir son exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure en mati\u00e8re de vente et de gestion chez Bell et ailleurs, avant de se joindre \u00e0 Bell.\n[11] C'est M. John Chung, un directeur des ventes titularis\u00e9 au Centre de marketing direct, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour le poste. Selon M. Weich, des candidats meilleurs que M. Virk avaient postul\u00e9 pour le poste.\n[12] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que dans le cadre de son emploi chez Bell, M. Virk s'est vu confier un certain nombre d'affectations int\u00e9rimaires. Ce qui constitue une affectation int\u00e9rimaire est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la pi\u00e8ce R-1.\n[13] On parle d'affectation int\u00e9rimaire lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 assume les responsabilit\u00e9s d'un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, lequel exige une responsabilit\u00e9 professionnelle et une comp\u00e9tence plus grande. Un exemple typique de ceci est lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 remplace un autre employ\u00e9 (dans un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9) qui est en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou en cong\u00e9 parental. Si l'affectation n'est pas de nature temporaire, l'employ\u00e9 devrait \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre promu au poste. Selon la pi\u00e8ce R-1, on a recours \u00e0 une affectation int\u00e9rimaire lorsque l'affectation est d'une dur\u00e9e sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 trois semaines.\n[14] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer le but des affectations int\u00e9rimaires dans le cas des employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le but \u00e9tait de combler un besoin d'une unit\u00e9 de travail particuli\u00e8re et que, dans la plupart des cas, les personnes qui se sont vu attribuer un poste int\u00e9rimaire \u00e9taient des personnes reconnues comme \u00e9tant capables de progresser dans leur carri\u00e8re. M. Weich a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les personnes \u00e0 qui on demande d'occuper un poste int\u00e9rimaire sont normalement choisies par la personne responsable d'une unit\u00e9 de travail particuli\u00e8re et ce, en fonction des besoins de cette unit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re.\n[15] Selon M. Weich, une affectation int\u00e9rimaire \u00e9voluera dans le temps en fonction des besoins de l'unit\u00e9 de travail. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a reconnu que les affectations int\u00e9rimaires sont tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quentes au Centre de marketing direct, que leur dur\u00e9e peut aller de quelques jours \u00e0 quelques mois et qu'elles permettent aux employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s d'avoir la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir de l'exp\u00e9rience dans un r\u00f4le de gestion.\n[16] Pour sa part, M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les affectations int\u00e9rimaires peuvent durer jusqu'\u00e0 14 mois, que les employ\u00e9s sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des postes int\u00e9rimaires en fonction des besoins ponctuels de l'entreprise et que si les besoins de l'entreprise viennent \u00e0 changer, les employ\u00e9s sont r\u00e9affect\u00e9s \u00e0 leur poste d'attache. Selon M. Makdessian, il arrive tr\u00e8s souvent que des employ\u00e9s qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'une affectation int\u00e9rimaire soient r\u00e9affect\u00e9s \u00e0 leur poste d'attache \u00e0 la fin de leur affectation.\n[17] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quelle fr\u00e9quence cela arrivait que des employ\u00e9s soient r\u00e9affect\u00e9s \u00e0 leur poste d'attache apr\u00e8s une affectation int\u00e9rimaire plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre imm\u00e9diatement nomm\u00e9s directeurs, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucune politique officielle chez Bell, que cela d\u00e9pend enti\u00e8rement des besoins d'une unit\u00e9 de travail particuli\u00e8re. De plus, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon lui, il n'existait aucune politique chez Bell visant \u00e0 titulariser des directeurs int\u00e9rimaires apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode de temps sp\u00e9cifique. Il a toutefois reconnu, dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'un directeur int\u00e9rimaire est potentiellement un directeur titularis\u00e9.\n[18] Pour sa part, M. Virk a reconnu que lorsqu'une affectation int\u00e9rimaire prend fin, il n'est pas inhabituel qu'un employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9 soit r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son ancien poste. Toutefois, M. Virk croit que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t \u00e9trange, voire m\u00eame tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange que cela soit arriv\u00e9.\n[19] Il ressort de la preuve que, en juillet 2001, M. Virk s'est vu confier une premi\u00e8re affectation int\u00e9rimaire comme directeur des ventes au sein de la division des consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct, puis une autre en septembre 2001. Cette derni\u00e8re affectation int\u00e9rimaire n'a comport\u00e9 aucun volet de surveillance du personnel. Selon M. Virk, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 dans le cadre de ce poste \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 un processus d'am\u00e9lioration \u00e0 la section de transmission des donn\u00e9es, laquelle \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e de s'occuper des rapports et de la saisie des revenus du Centre de marketing direct dans son ensemble.\nB. L'implication de M. Virk par rapport au projet Globe and Mail [20] Il ressort de la preuve que, en juillet 2001, le Globe and Mail a approch\u00e9 Bell dans le but de cr\u00e9er un centre d'appels en vue de faire de la sollicitation d'abonn\u00e9s potentiels au Globe and Mail. Une premi\u00e8re rencontre a eu lieu en ao\u00fbt 2001 avec des repr\u00e9sentants du Globe and Mail. On a pris la d\u00e9cision de cr\u00e9er un centre d'appels dans le groupe de gestion des vendeurs au sein du Centre de marketing direct en raison de l'expertise de ce groupe dans ce domaine. M. Ted Weich a pris la direction du projet.\n[21] Aux termes de l'entente conclue avec le Globe and Mail, ce dernier fournirait \u00e0 chaque mois \u00e0 Bell Canada des listes d'appels comprenant environ de 135 000 \u00e0 150 000 num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Bell Canada devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 sur une base de contact. Au d\u00e9part, le projet Globe and Mail \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre un projet pilote d'une dur\u00e9e de deux mois.\n[22] On a pass\u00e9 les mois de septembre et d'octobre 2001 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er le projet et celui-ci a vu le jour en novembre 2001. Il ressort de la preuve que M. Weich a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans la cr\u00e9ation de l'infrastructure du projet Globe and Mail. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a reconnu que M. Weich avait particip\u00e9 au lancement du projet Globe and Mail et qu'il \u00e9tait en fait celui qui l'avait mont\u00e9.\n[23] Selon M. Weich, des employ\u00e9s temporaires plut\u00f4t que des employ\u00e9s permanents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour le projet et ce, en raison de la restructuration qui \u00e9tait en cours \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 Bell Canada. Le nombre d'employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s a vari\u00e9 entre douze et quatorze.\n[24] En octobre 2001, M. Virk s'est vu offrir par M. Weich, son superviseur, un poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail. Ce poste n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9. M. Virk a accept\u00e9 l'offre et est devenu le directeur int\u00e9rimaire du projet le 22 octobre 2001. Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 rendre compte \u00e0 M. Weich.\n[25] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de choisir un directeur int\u00e9rimaire pour le projet plut\u00f4t qu'un directeur titularis\u00e9, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, comme il s'agissait d'un essai, il croyait qu'un directeur int\u00e9rimaire conviendrait mieux. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi il avait choisi M. Virk, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il voulait donner l'occasion \u00e0 M. Virk de perfectionner ses comp\u00e9tences compte tenu du fait que celui-ci avait dans le pass\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir d'exercer une fonction de directeur afin de perfectionner ses comp\u00e9tences.\n[26] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 quel pourcentage de son temps il avait consacr\u00e9 au projet Globe and Mail durant les mois de septembre, octobre, novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2001, M. Weich a r\u00e9pondu que le projet Globe and Mail avait pris environ 80 p. 100 de son temps au cours des deux premiers mois et probablement entre 60 et 65 p. 100 de son temps au cours des mois de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[27] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Weich a reconnu que M. Virk avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la cr\u00e9ation du projet Globe and Mail, notamment en participant \u00e0 l'installation d'un certain nombre de postes de travail, en s'assurant que leur configuration \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quate et en participant \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques.\n[28] Selon M. Weich, le r\u00f4le de M. Virk dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail consistait \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les activit\u00e9s sur le plancher, \u00e0 participer \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions de groupe et \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer des rapports. M. Virk a mentionn\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de ses fonctions, il devait g\u00e9rer les listes d'abonn\u00e9s potentiels, assurer la liaison avec d'autres groupes et installer des ordinateurs. M. Weich a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en ce qui concerne le projet Globe and Mail, M. Virk avait assum\u00e9 un plus grand nombre de responsabilit\u00e9s qu'un directeur des ventes en assume normalement au Centre de marketing direct.\n[29] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk consid\u00e9rait que c'\u00e9tait lui et non pas M. Weich qui \u00e9tait directeur du projet. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Weich a fortement contest\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation faite par M. Virk. M. Virk a toutefois reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Weich \u00e9tait l'architecte du projet.\n[30] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il ressort clairement de la preuve que, durant les mois de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2001, M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9, en tout temps, le directeur des ventes int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail, que M. Weich est demeur\u00e9 le directeur du projet et que M. Virk travaillait sous sa surveillance et ses ordres.\n[31] Le 30 novembre 2001, M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par M. Weich qu'une restructuration serait effectu\u00e9e dans son groupe (gestion des vendeurs) \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002 et que, \u00e0 compter du 2 janvier 2002, le projet rel\u00e8verait du groupe de M. Charlie Latino (division des consommateurs). Il ressort de la preuve que, cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk que, \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002, il continuerait \u00e0 participer au projet Globe and Mail mais qu'il recouvrerait son statut d'adjoint principal en rempla\u00e7ant M. Simon Shim comme adjoint principal du projet.\n[32] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer le motif de ce transfert, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu du contenu du projet et de ce qu'il comportait, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il cadrait mieux avec le groupe de M. Latino.\n[33] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Weich lui avait affirm\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de le r\u00e9affecter \u00e0 son poste d'adjoint principal n'\u00e9tait aucunement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son rendement. Selon M. Weich, M. Virk n'a jamais exprim\u00e9, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le d\u00e9sir de quitter le projet Globe and Mail quand il a appris qu'il recouvrerait \u00e9ventuellement son statut d'adjoint principal ou qu'il serait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre poste au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion.\n[34] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Weich a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 M. Virk que c'\u00e9tait un directeur titularis\u00e9 de la division des consommateurs qui deviendrait directeur du projet Globe and Mail et ce, \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002. Cette personne \u00e9tait M. Penno Makdessian. M. Virk devait continuer \u00e0 participer au projet afin d'aider M. Makdessian.\n[35] Selon M. Weich, compte tenu du fait que M. Latino prendrait en charge le projet \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002, la d\u00e9cision de choisir M. Makdessian a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle de M. Latino et non la sienne m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en novembre 2001. M. Weich a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Latino l'avait consult\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[36] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi M. Virk serait renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'adjoint principal \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002, M. Weich a offert l'explication suivante : comme le projet allait relever de l'organisation de M. Latino et comme la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait en train de restructurer ses op\u00e9rations au Centre de marketing direct et qu'un certain nombre de directeurs des ventes risquaient de perdre leurs emplois alors que les employ\u00e9s comme M. Virk ne courraient pas ce risque car ils \u00e9taient renvoy\u00e9s dans les postes qu'ils occupaient auparavant, on a pris la d\u00e9cision d'aller chercher au sein de la division des consommateurs un directeur des ventes titularis\u00e9 pour diriger le projet. Selon M. Weich, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une bonne d\u00e9cision op\u00e9rationnelle et n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le rendement de M. Virk quant au projet Globe and Mail.\n[37] Selon la preuve, une restructuration comporte l'\u00e9limination de certains postes au sein d'un organisme ou d'un service, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes dont l'organisme ou le service peuvent se passer.\n[38] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien qu'un organisme effectue une restructuration, il comblera tout de m\u00eame des emplois qu'il estime cruciaux pour les activit\u00e9s de l'organisme. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'est pas inhabituel dans ces circonstances qu'un organisme affiche un poste pour remplacer son titulaire qui quitte. M. Virk a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait normal pour un organisme de remplir un poste cl\u00e9, un poste dont la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut pas se passer lorsqu'il est laiss\u00e9 vacant par son titulaire m\u00eame si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est en mode de restructuration.\n[39] Il ressort de la preuve que, en d\u00e9cembre 2001, un poste de directeur des ventes au Centre de marketing direct a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 lorsque le titulaire de ce poste a quitt\u00e9.\n[40] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi le Centre de marketing direct embauchait alors que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait en restructuration, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le poste de directeur des ventes \u00e9tait crucial quant aux activit\u00e9s de l'unit\u00e9 de travail et devait \u00eatre combl\u00e9 par un directeur des ventes titularis\u00e9 en raison du niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'expertise exig\u00e9. On a choisi une personne qui occupait le poste de directeur des ventes titularis\u00e9 \u00e0 la division des consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct.\n[41] Enfin, lors de la r\u00e9union du 30 novembre 2001, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk que, en raison de la restructuration qui avait lieu au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il n'y aurait plus de poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 compter de novembre 2001.\n[42] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer cette d\u00e9cision, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la priorit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation des emplois des directeurs des ventes titularis\u00e9s, lesquels risquaient de perdre leurs emplois dans un contexte de restructuration et ce, avant d'accorder des affectations int\u00e9rimaires. \u00c0 maintes reprises, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu'un directeur titularis\u00e9 risque de perdre son emploi, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tentera de prot\u00e9ger l'emploi de cette personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle mettra fin \u00e0 une affectation de directeur int\u00e9rimaire, si bon que soit son rendement, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l'emploi d'un directeur titularis\u00e9 sachant que le directeur int\u00e9rimaire sera r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi syndiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur.\n[43] M. Virk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, il avait cru l'explication que M. Weich lui avait donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi on le rempla\u00e7ait comme directeur int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail. Ses sentiments ont chang\u00e9, selon son t\u00e9moignage, lorsqu'il a constat\u00e9 \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre que deux employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s s'\u00e9taient vu accorder des affectations de directeur int\u00e9rimaire et ce, \u00e0 compter du 2 janvier 2002. Il s'agissait de Mme Debbie Vieira et de M. Ernesto Imbrogno. Ces deux personnes travaillaient comme adjoints \u00e0 la division des consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct. Toutes deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es directeur des ventes int\u00e9rimaire de la division des consommateurs.\n[44] Selon la preuve, Mme Vieira se serait vu accorder huit affectations int\u00e9rimaires en 2002 et, apr\u00e8s chaque affectation, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9e au poste qu'elle occupait ant\u00e9rieurement. En janvier 2003, elle s'est vu accorder une nouvelle affectation de directrice int\u00e9rimaire et fut \u00e9ventuellement titularis\u00e9e comme directrice. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a reconnu qu'il \u00e9tait logique qu'une personne qui a occup\u00e9 un poste int\u00e9rimaire obtienne ce poste si celui-ci devient ouvert.\n[45] Quant \u00e0 M. Imbrogno, il ressort de la preuve que, \u00e0 la fin de l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire susmentionn\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'adjoint au marketing direct.\n[46] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi Mme Debbie Vieira et M. Ernesto Imbrogno, deux personnes de race blanche, se sont vu accorder des affectations int\u00e9rimaires et ce, \u00e0 compter du 2 janvier 2002, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces affectations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es au sein de la division des consommateurs, sous la direction de M. Latino, et qu'il ne connaissait pas les raisons pour lesquelles ces deux affectations int\u00e9rimaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es. Il a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, le 30 novembre 2001, lorsqu'il a rencontr\u00e9 M. Virk, les renseignements qu'il poss\u00e9dait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9taient qu'il n'y aurait pas de postes pour les directeurs int\u00e9rimaires.\n[47] Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2001, M. Virk a envoy\u00e9 une note de service \u00e0 M. Weich dans laquelle il faisait part de sa d\u00e9ception quant au fait qu'il serait r\u00e9affect\u00e9 au poste d'adjoint principal dans le projet au lancement duquel et \u00e0 la gestion duquel il avait particip\u00e9 depuis ses d\u00e9buts. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son courriel qu'il continuerait d'apporter son aide et son appui au projet mais que, compte tenu des circonstances, il tenterait de trouver autre chose chez Bell en 2002.\n[48] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse au courriel de M. Virk, M. Weich a offert d'aider ce dernier \u00e0 trouver un autre poste d'adjoint principal chez Bell. Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk n'a jamais demand\u00e9 l'aide de M. Weich.\n[49] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Virk a fait allusion au fait que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Weich \u00e0 \u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs comme adjoint principal de telle sorte qu'une autre personne de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs prenne la rel\u00e8ve du poste d'adjoint principal du projet Globe and Mail. M. Virk a affirm\u00e9 que cela lui aurait \u00e9pargn\u00e9 beaucoup d'angoisse. M. Weich a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Virk n'avait jamais exprim\u00e9 ce d\u00e9sir.\n[50] Il ressort de la preuve que le projet Globe and Mail a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9, le 1er janvier 2002, du groupe de gestion des vendeurs \u00e0 la division des consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct. Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que M. Weich a officiellement cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en charge du projet Globe and Mail \u00e0 partir du 1er janvier 2002.\n[51] Quant \u00e0 M. Virk, il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 2 janvier 2002 sur le projet Globe and Mail, cette fois-ci comme adjoint principal et non pas comme directeur int\u00e9rimaire. Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk relevait de M. Makdessian, lequel relevait de M. Latino. M. Virk a remplac\u00e9 M. Simon Shim qui travaillait sur le projet Globe and Mail comme adjoint principal. Selon M. Virk, M. Shim fut r\u00e9affect\u00e9 ailleurs.\n[52] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il avait fait dans le projet Globe and Mail apr\u00e8s le 2 janvier 2002, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir des conseils \u00e0 ceux qui s'occupaient du projet pendant environ trois mois \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ses connaissances et son expertise. Toutefois, durant cette p\u00e9riode, il ne s'est pas occup\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s courantes car c'est M. Makdessian qui s'en est occup\u00e9 et il n'a eu aucun mot \u00e0 dire quant au processus d'embauche.\n[53] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'il ne croyait pas que M. Makdessian pouvait s'acquitter de la t\u00e2che aussi bien que lui. M. Virk a fait allusion au fait que lorsque M. Makdessian a pris en charge le projet Globe and Mail, il n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience quant au projet. Ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par M. Makdessian qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a pris le projet \u00e0 sa charge, l'ensemble de ses aspects ne lui \u00e9tait pas familier, mais qu'il avait appris au fur et \u00e0 mesure.\n[54] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer le contexte dans lequel il s'est joint au projet, M. Makdessian a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la fin de novembre ou au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 2001, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par son directeur adjoint, M. Charlie Latino, que la strat\u00e9gie pour 2002 de la division des ventes aux consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct serait diff\u00e9rente, qu'il travaillerait moins et que cela signifiait qu'il y aurait une r\u00e9duction du nombre de directeurs. Selon M. Makdessian, M. Latino l'a inform\u00e9 de la restructuration que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 effectuerait et qu'il lui obtiendrait un poste de directeur titularis\u00e9.\n[55] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il \u00e9tait advenu de son ancien poste de directeur des ventes \u00e0 la division des ventes aux consommateurs apr\u00e8s qu'il eut pris le poste au projet Globe and Mail, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son ancienne \u00e9quipe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mantel\u00e9e, que les employ\u00e9s qui faisaient partie de cette \u00e9quipe avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partis entre les directeurs des ventes qui \u00e9taient demeur\u00e9s au service des ventes et que, en fait, son poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9.\n[56] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a pris \u00e0 sa charge le projet Globe and Mail, M. Virk avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu d\u00e9\u00e7u, et lui avait fait part de ce fait. Selon M. Makdessian, M. Virk l'avait assur\u00e9 qu'il allait donner le meilleur de lui-m\u00eame pendant qu'il serait l\u00e0 et qu'il ne le laisserait pas tomber. M. Virk a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 M. Makdessian qu'il essayerait de trouver autre chose chez Bell. M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait offert d'aider M. Virk, mais que celui-ci ne lui avait jamais demand\u00e9 son aide.\n[57] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer en quoi il avait fait avancer le projet Globe and Mail, M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'une de ses r\u00e9alisations avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la conception et la mise en uvre d'un programme de mesures incitatives et de mesures de reconnaissance. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait apport\u00e9 avec lui une grande expertise dans le domaine de la vente, laquelle l'avait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 encadrer son \u00e9quipe.\n[58] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Makdessian a dirig\u00e9 le projet Globe and Mail entre le 2 janvier 2002 et le 25 avril 2002. Selon M. Virk, durant cette p\u00e9riode, les objectifs de ventes mensuels n'ont pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 atteints.\n[59] En avril 2002, M. Makdessian est devenu chef d'\u00e9quipe principal int\u00e9rimaire dans le groupe des ventes aux consommateurs au sein de l'organisation de M. Charlie Latino. C'est ainsi que le poste de directeur des ventes du projet Globe and Mail est devenu vacant.\n[60] Dans son nouveau r\u00f4le de chef d'\u00e9quipe principal, M. Makdessian \u00e9tait responsable du projet Globe and Mail ainsi que responsable d'autres projets. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a reconnu que, en tant que chef d'\u00e9quipe principal, il s'occupait moins de la gestion au quotidien du projet Globe and Mail. Il a de plus reconnu que, lorsqu'il a cess\u00e9 de diriger le projet Globe and Mail, M. Virk a d\u00fb diriger le projet \u00e0 lui seul.\n[61] Le 25 avril 2002, on a \u00e9mis un courriel annon\u00e7ant que M. Virk serait le directeur des ventes int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail \u00e0 compter du 23 avril 2002. Le courriel faisait part que la fin de l'affectation \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue pour le 30 juin 2002. Il ressort toutefois de la preuve que, \u00e0 la fin de juin 2002, l'affectation de M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e jusqu'au 3 octobre 2002. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le 25 avril 2002, M. Weich a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Virk pour le f\u00e9liciter quant \u00e0 sa nouvelle affectation int\u00e9rimaire.\n[62] M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait M. Latino qui avait pris la d\u00e9cision d'accorder l'affectation de directeur des ventes \u00e0 M. Virk. M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait appuy\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de M. Latino car il travaillait avec M. Virk depuis janvier.\n[63] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Makdessian, M. Virk ne s'est pas vu accorder le poste de directeur des ventes \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 mais s'est plut\u00f4t vu accorder une affectation int\u00e9rimaire parce que M. Makdessian voulait avoir l'occasion d'observer M. Virk sur une base quotidienne. Il voulait voir notamment si celui-ci poss\u00e9dait les qualit\u00e9s de chef qu'il recherchait chez un directeur des ventes.\n[64] Il ressort de la preuve que, en septembre 2002, M. Makdessian a \u00e9t\u00e9 titularis\u00e9 dans son poste de chef d'\u00e9quipe principal, qu'il a occup\u00e9 jusqu'en septembre 2003 avant d'occuper par int\u00e9rim le poste de directeur adjoint au service des ventes de la division des consommateurs du Centre de marketing direct.\n[65] Pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 23 avril 2002 au 3 octobre 2002, M. Virk, en tant que directeur int\u00e9rimaire et Mme Madeline Young, une associ\u00e9e, \u00e9taient les deux seules personnes engag\u00e9es sur une base quotidienne dans le projet Globe and Mail. M. Virk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, durant cette p\u00e9riode, il avait atteint tous ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de vente et de prise de contact. Cela fut confirm\u00e9 par M. Makdessian dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[66] \u00c0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode, M. Virk a recouvr\u00e9 son poste habituel d'adjoint principal et M. Ron Singh, un directeur titularis\u00e9, qui est d'origine sud-asiatique, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 au poste de directeur des ventes du projet Globe and Mail, poste qu'il a occup\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin du projet Globe and Mail en octobre 2003. M. Virk a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Singh \u00e9tait comme lui d'origine sud-asiatique. Selon M. Virk, M. Singh \u00e9tait capable de s'acquitter ad\u00e9quatement de la t\u00e2che.\n[67] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi M. Singh, un directeur titularis\u00e9, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Virk en octobre 2002 pour diriger le projet Globe and Mail, M. Makdessian a expliqu\u00e9 que, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le projet avan\u00e7ait, les partenaires du Globe demandaient que son groupe fixe des objectifs de vente plus agressifs. Des campagnes plus compliqu\u00e9es, demandant beaucoup d'attention et comportant une foule de d\u00e9tails, pointaient donc \u00e0 l'horizon.\n[68] M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces exigences, il avait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aller de l'avant avec M. Ron Singh plut\u00f4t qu'avec M. Virk, \u00e9tant d'avis que M. Singh \u00e9tait plus apte que M. Virk \u00e0 faire le travail parce qu'il poss\u00e9dait de solides ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de vente. Selon M. Makdessian, c'\u00e9tait M. Latino qui avait pris la d\u00e9cision apr\u00e8s lui avoir demand\u00e9 son opinion.\n[69] Il ressort de la preuve que, en ao\u00fbt 2003, M. Virk a obtenu une nouvelle affectation int\u00e9rimaire au projet Globe and Mail en rempla\u00e7ant M. Ron Singh comme directeur int\u00e9rimaire alors que ce dernier \u00e9tait en vacance. Cette affectation a dur\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin d'octobre 2003.\n[70] En octobre 2003, le groupe de M. Makdessian fut avis\u00e9 par les partenaires du Globe qu'ils allaient r\u00e9duire d'une mani\u00e8re importante le volume des appels, d'abord de 50 p. 100 dans le mois de novembre, puis de 75 p. 100 dans le mois de d\u00e9cembre.\n[71] Compte tenu de l'avis du Globe and Mail, Bell Canada a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la rentabilit\u00e9 globale de la relation qu'elle entretenait avec ses partenaires du Globe et a conclu que, financi\u00e8rement, il n'\u00e9tait pas logique de continuer de s'occuper du Globe and Mail, \u00e0 moins que le Globe ne puisse garantir un volume d'appels plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et ne convienne de fixer de nouveaux prix par contrat. Comme le Globe and Mail n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 modifier les modalit\u00e9s de l'entente, on a pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre d\u00e9finitivement fin au projet Globe and Mail.\n[72] Il ressort de la preuve que le projet a pris fin le 31 octobre 2003. M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les repr\u00e9sentants du Globe and Mail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choqu\u00e9s par cette d\u00e9cision et ont demand\u00e9 s'ils pouvaient faire une contre-offre.\n[73] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer l'annonce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 4 novembre 2003 selon laquelle le projet prenait fin quant \u00e0 la partie non \u00e9coul\u00e9e de 2003 mais qu'il ne prenait pas fin de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu que les repr\u00e9sentants du Globe and Mail avaient affirm\u00e9 qu'ils feraient une contre-offre, Bell d\u00e9sirait se tenir pr\u00eate au cas o\u00f9 le Globe and Mail ferait effectivement une contre-offre. Bell ne croyait pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que le projet reprendrait mais elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 laisser la porte ouverte.\n[74] Le 5 novembre 2003, M. Penno Makdessian a tenu une r\u00e9union avec un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s du Centre de marketing direct pour annoncer que, compte tenu de la restructuration qui avait lieu chez Bell, certains postes, sept en fait, seraient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires.\n[75] Selon M. Makdessian, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union trois des quatre employ\u00e9s de solution Premier appel, c'est-\u00e0-dire, M. Virk, Mme Young, Mme Karen Anderson ainsi que Mme Anna Paolella du Centre de marketing direct et Mme Sonia Bell, une repr\u00e9sentante syndicale de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation du personnel des ventes de l'ACET. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se rappeler pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment quelles personnes \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes.\n[76] Il ressort de la preuve que les personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es qu'il serait mis fin \u00e0 la fonction de solution Premier appel ainsi qu'au projet Globe and Mail. On leur a \u00e9galement dit que le poste au Centre de contact en ligne, lequel \u00e9tait un poste temporaire d\u00e9tenu par Mme Karen Anderson, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire, son avenir \u00e9tant incertain. Contrairement au poste de solution Premier appel et au poste du Globe and Mail, lesquels faisaient l'objet d'une \u00e9limination imm\u00e9diate, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que quelqu'un occupe \u00e0 titre temporaire le poste au Centre de contact en ligne. M. Virk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui une surprise totale.\n[77] Selon M. Makdessian, les personnes qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 5 novembre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es que tous ceux qui poss\u00e9daient plus de huit ann\u00e9es de service pouvaient, en vertu de la convention collective, exercer leur droit de supplantation et que s'ils le d\u00e9siraient, ils pouvaient s'adresser au syndicat ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe de gestion afin d'obtenir de plus amples explications quant \u00e0 la supplantation. La convention collective pour le personnel de bureau et les employ\u00e9s associ\u00e9s de l'ACET traite express\u00e9ment de la question de la supplantation.\n[78] Il ressort de la preuve que les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s qu'ils avaient jusqu'au 12 novembre 2003 pour exercer leur droit de supplantation. Ce d\u00e9lai a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 jusqu'au 19 novembre 2003. On leur a enfin dit que s'ils choisissaient d'exercer leur droit de supplantation, ils devraient occuper le poste choisi dans un d\u00e9lai de 21 jours et ce, sans aucune formation officielle.\n[79] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se rappeler que M. Makdessian avait expliqu\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents le 5 novembre 2003 que les employ\u00e9s comme lui qui avaient huit ann\u00e9es de service ou plus pouvaient se servir de leur droit de supplantation quant \u00e0 un poste occup\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s qui avaient moins de huit ann\u00e9es de service, que les employ\u00e9s disposaient d'une semaine \u00e0 partir du 5 novembre 2003 pour exercer leur droit de supplantation et que, s'ils d\u00e9siraient exercer celui-ci, ils devraient pr\u00e9venir leur directeur.\n[80] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk aurait pu supplanter au sein du groupe de gestion des vendeurs quatre adjoints principaux dont les postes n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a reconnu qu'il avait plus d'ann\u00e9es de service que ces quatre personnes et qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour faire leur travail. Il a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Makdessian ne lui avait jamais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment affirm\u00e9 qu'il aurait pu les supplanter. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ce fait, il aurait exerc\u00e9 son droit de supplantation.\n[81] Il ressort de la preuve qu'aucun des employ\u00e9s dont le poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire le 5 novembre 2003 a en fait exerc\u00e9 son droit de supplantation. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de fournir une explication, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tonnant compte tenu que de nombreuses personnes se sentaient mal \u00e0 l'aise de faire perdre un emploi \u00e0 une autre personne. Selon M. Makdessian, il est arriv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu souvent que des employ\u00e9s exercent leur droit de supplantation.\n[82] Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 5 novembre 2003, M. Makdessian a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 M. Virk confirmant que son emploi chez Bell Canada prendrait fin le 11 janvier 2004. Cette lettre a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 M. Virk quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9affectation au sein de Bell, \u00e0 la continuation du salaire, aux avantages sociaux, au r\u00e9gime de pension, etc. La lettre \u00e9tait toutefois silencieuse quant aux droits de supplantation.\n[83] Il ressort de la preuve que, le 11 novembre 2003, M. Makdessian a rencontr\u00e9 M. Virk. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Virk a reconnu que, au cours de la r\u00e9union, M. Makdessian a examin\u00e9 avec lui les divers choix qui s'offraient \u00e0 lui, compte tenu du fait que son poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire. M. Virk a \u00e9galement reconnu que M. Makdessian lui avait demand\u00e9 comment allait sa recherche d'emploi et qu'il lui avait dit que lui ainsi que M. Singh l'aideraient \u00e0 passer \u00e0 travers cette \u00e9preuve.\n[84] M. Virk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 moment-l\u00e0, il avait inform\u00e9 M. Makdessian qu'il souhaitait chercher un autre poste et qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste d'adjoint principal au sein du groupe de travail du Centre de marketing direct et qu'il attendait une r\u00e9ponse avec impatience. Il ressort de la preuve qu'il n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette r\u00e9ponse.\n[85] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk que le poste au Centre de contact en ligne, quoique temporaire, \u00e9tait disponible et qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour prendre cet emploi s'il le d\u00e9sirait. Selon M. Virk, le poste au Centre de contact direct \u00e9tait le seul emploi dont M. Makdessian avait fait mention. M. Makdessian n'a jamais parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk de son droit de supplantation en rapport avec les autres adjoints principaux du groupe de gestion des vendeurs.\n[86] M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, M. Virk lui avait mentionn\u00e9 qu'il ne d\u00e9sirait plus obtenir le poste d'adjoint principal au Centre de contact en ligne parce que ce poste \u00e9tait temporaire. Cela est reconnu par M. Virk. Selon M. Makdessian, M. Virk a beaucoup insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu'il \u00e9tait mal \u00e0 l'aise avec l'id\u00e9e de prendre un poste occup\u00e9 par une autre personne.\n[87] Selon M. Makdessian, l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire accol\u00e9e au poste du Centre de contact en ligne occup\u00e9 par Mme Anderson a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 11 novembre 2003. Il ressort de la preuve que Mme Anderson est parvenue \u00e0 convaincre l'intim\u00e9e et le syndicat qu'il \u00e9tait insens\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer son poste exc\u00e9dentaire, bien qu'il f\u00fbt temporaire, compte tenu du fait que le poste ne faisait pas l'objet d'une abolition \u00e0 ce stade. Le statut du poste de Mme Anderson a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9.\n[88] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 quelle incidence cette d\u00e9cision avait eue sur Mme Anderson, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait eu une grande incidence sur elle car si Bell n'avait pas agi de la sorte, elle aurait perdu son emploi en janvier 2002. Compte tenu cependant que personne n'\u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 exercer son droit de supplantation, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et le syndicat ont conclu que la chose \u00e9quitable \u00e0 faire \u00e9tait de lui laisser son poste temporaire. Selon M. Makdessian, cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e et le syndicat comme n'ayant aucune incidence sur les droits de supplantation des autres employ\u00e9s parce que tout employ\u00e9 aurait encore pu exercer son droit de supplantation sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\n[89] M. Makdessian a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait pas inform\u00e9 M. Virk du retrait du statut d'exc\u00e9dentaire accol\u00e9 au poste du Centre de contact en ligne occup\u00e9 par Mme Anderson. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il ne l'avait pas fait apr\u00e8s le 11 novembre 2003, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision n'avait eu aucune incidence sur le statut de M. Virk, que ce dernier avait toujours la possibilit\u00e9, comme tout employ\u00e9 ayant huit ann\u00e9es de service, d'exercer \u00e0 sa guise son droit de supplantation. Compte tenu du fait que M. Virk lui avait clairement affirm\u00e9 qu'il se sentirait mal \u00e0 l'aise de le faire, M. Makdessian ne voyait aucune raison d'en reparler \u00e0 M. Virk.\n[90] Il ressort de la preuve que, le 27 novembre 2003, M. Virk a contact\u00e9 M. Makdessian afin de comprendre les motifs pour lesquels le poste au Centre de contact en ligne de Mme Anderson n'\u00e9tait plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire. M. Makdessian a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk que le fait que le poste de Mme Anderson ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire n'avait eu aucune incidence sur sa capacit\u00e9 de faire la transition dans le poste d'adjoint principal qu'elle occupait, une chose qu'il aurait pu faire lorsque l'occasion propice s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a reconnu que le 27 novembre 2003 il \u00e9tait trop tard pour que M. Virk puisse exercer son droit de supplantation.\n[91] M. Makdessian a, de plus, expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk que le fait que le poste au Centre de contact en ligne ne soit pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire ne laissait aucunement entendre que ce poste \u00e9tait permanent, son avenir \u00e9tant toujours incertain \u00e0 ce stade.\n[92] Il ressort du dossier que, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Virk a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Makdessian, \u00e0 M. Charlie Latino et \u00e0 M. Ron Singh, un courriel concernant la fausse information quant au statut d'exc\u00e9dentaire du poste au Centre de contact en ligne. Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2003, ainsi que les 10 et 11 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Makdessian a tent\u00e9 en vain de rejoindre M. Virk.\n[93] Le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Virk a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Makdessian mentionnant qu'il pourrait le rencontrer le jour suivant. M. Makdessian a confirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait disponible.\n[94] Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Virk a appel\u00e9 M. Makdessian pour l'informer qu'il ne pourrait pas assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Une nouvelle r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Toutefois, le matin du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Virk a appel\u00e9 M. Makdessian pour lui dire qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus disponible mais qu'il pourrait peut-\u00eatre le rencontrer le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[95] Il ressort du dossier que, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Virk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre l'intim\u00e9e dans lequel il pr\u00e9tendait que le fait qu'elle ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 les bons renseignements avait eu pour cons\u00e9quence de lui faire rater une chance de supplanter un adjoint principal ayant moins d'exp\u00e9rience au Centre de contact en ligne.\n[96] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Virk a reconnu qu'il avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre son syndicat pour l'avoir mal repr\u00e9sent\u00e9. M. Virk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il tenait le syndicat en partie responsable pour ne pas l'avoir inform\u00e9 du retrait de l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire ant\u00e9rieurement accol\u00e9e au poste de Mme Anderson.\n[97] Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2003, une r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue entre Mme Sonia Bell, une repr\u00e9sentante syndicale de l'ACET, M. Makdessian et M. Virk afin de discuter du grief concernant l'omission de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'informer M. Virk de la modification du statut d'exc\u00e9dentaire attribu\u00e9 au poste de Mme Anderson.\n[98] Il ressort du dossier que Mme Bell a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Makdessian que M. Virk s'est senti induit en erreur quant \u00e0 la position de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 concernant le poste au Centre de contact en ligne. Selon M. Makdessian, Mme Bell, laquelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si M. Virk avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de retirer l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire quant poste de Mme Anderson, M. Virk aurait pu vouloir exercer son droit de supplantation.\n[99] M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait dit \u00e0 Mme Bell que le retrait de l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire quant au poste de Karen Anderson n'avait eu aucune incidence sur la capacit\u00e9 de M. Virk d'exercer son droit de supplantation s'il avait voulu l'exercer. Le retrait de l'\u00e9tiquette n'avait pas non plus chang\u00e9 la nature temporaire du poste.\n[100] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Makdessian a rejet\u00e9 le grief apr\u00e8s avoir rencontr\u00e9 Mme Sonia Bell. M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en compagnie de Mme Bell, il avait examin\u00e9 les motifs pour lesquels M. Virk voulait supplanter Mme Anderson ainsi que ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit lors de la r\u00e9union tenue le 5 novembre 2003, une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle Mme Bell avait assist\u00e9. Selon M. Makdessian, Mme Bell a enti\u00e8rement souscrit \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par M. Makdessian \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Il ressort de la preuve que le 13 janvier 2004, le grief de M. Virk fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Maria Arpino et fut rejet\u00e9.\n[101] L'emploi de M. Virk chez Bell a pris fin le 11 janvier 2004. Il ressort de la preuve que le statut du poste au Centre de contact en ligne n'avait toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 en date de l'audience. Il \u00e9tait toujours temporaire.\n[102] Le projet Globe and Mail a repris le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2004. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi le projet du Globe and Mail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 relanc\u00e9 en 2004, M. Makdessian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en janvier 2004, les experts-conseils du Globe and Mail avaient contact\u00e9 Mme Arpino et avaient affirm\u00e9 qu'ils d\u00e9siraient r\u00e9examiner la question de la structure de prix. Une r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue au cours de laquelle une nouvelle structure de prix a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e.\n[103] Selon M. Makdessian, la d\u00e9cision de relancer le projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise le m\u00eame jour que la tenue de la r\u00e9union ou le jour apr\u00e8s. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 de formuler des observations quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi le projet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 relanc\u00e9 si rapidement \u00e0 la fin de janvier 2004, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'aucune des applications n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e compte tenu qu'aucun autre projet n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9 pour le remplacer.\n[104] Il ressort de la preuve que la relance du projet Globe and Mail a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e par des modifications \u00e0 la structure de l'\u00e9quipe du Globe and Mail. Les postes d'adjoints principaux occup\u00e9s par M. Virk ainsi que celui d'adjoint occup\u00e9 par Mme Young ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis. Un poste de coordonnateur d'\u00e9quipe a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 afin d'aider le directeur des ventes, M. Ron Singh, lequel avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 directeur des ventes du projet. Selon la preuve, c'est M. Rakesh Sharma, lequel \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 chef d'\u00e9quipe, qui s'est vu accorder l'emploi. Il ressort de la preuve que le poste de coordonnateur d'\u00e9quipe est vis\u00e9 par la convention collective pour le personnel des ventes de l'ACET par opposition \u00e0 la convention collective pour le personnel de bureau, laquelle s'appliquait \u00e0 M. Virk.\n[105] De plus, un grand nombre des proc\u00e9dures furent simplifi\u00e9es et automatis\u00e9es. Selon M. Makdessian, la nouvelle structure a exig\u00e9 beaucoup moins de travail administratif, l'accent ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur la formation du personnel en mati\u00e8re de vente. Dans ce contexte, le poste de coordonnateur d'\u00e9quipe cadrait davantage avec la nouvelle structure que celui d'adjoint principal.\nIII. ANALYSE [106] Le Tribunal est saisi de deux questions. La premi\u00e8re a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Virk a fait l'objet de discrimination de la part de Bell au cours de son emploi et ce, par le biais des actes de M. Weich, au motif qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique (question de la discrimination). La deuxi\u00e8me a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Makdessian a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Virk pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne (question des repr\u00e9sailles).\n[107] Quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, M. Virk pr\u00e9tend que la discrimination est survenue lorsque, comme il l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 du poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire au poste d'adjoint principal qu'il occupait ant\u00e9rieurement et ce, \u00e0 compter du 2 janvier 2002, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre titularis\u00e9 comme directeur des ventes le 2 janvier 2002, et cela parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique.\n[108] Sur ce point, M. Virk demande notamment que l'intim\u00e9e lui accorde un poste de direction en raison de son rendement et en raison de l'occasion qu'il a eue en janvier 2002 de devenir directeur. Selon M. Virk, il \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors capable d'occuper un poste de direction et il aurait d\u00fb devenir directeur titularis\u00e9. \u00c0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention, M. Virk invoque le fait que deux employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s de race blanche ont obtenu des affectations int\u00e9rimaires en janvier 2002 et ont ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 titularis\u00e9s comme directeurs.\n[109] Quant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question, la principale all\u00e9gation de M. Virk est que des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es lorsque M. Makdessian ne lui a pas dit que le poste de Mme Karen Anderson, lequel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire, n'\u00e9tait plus, \u00e0 la mi-novembre 2003, un poste exc\u00e9dentaire. M. Virk a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que le fait que, en novembre 2003, M. Makdessian n'a jamais fait mention, outre Mme Karen Anderson, des adjoints principaux qu'il aurait pu supplanter, constituait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. M. Virk a m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 qu'il estimait que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de 2002 qui ont men\u00e9 aux repr\u00e9sailles faisaient partie des repr\u00e9sailles et ce, sans pr\u00e9ciser quels \u00e9taient ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\nA. LA QUESTION DE LA DISCRIMINATION [110] C'est une chose que d'all\u00e9guer la discrimination, mais c'est autre chose que d'en faire la preuve. La discrimination se produit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de fa\u00e7on subtile et est donc souvent difficile \u00e0 prouver. La personne qui all\u00e8gue la discrimination dans un contexte d'emploi doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui am\u00e8neront le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure que la discrimination a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait que cette personne n'a pas obtenu un poste.\n[111] En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Virk devait prouver que, le 2 janvier 2002, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique. M. Virk devait prouver des faits qui am\u00e8neraient le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure que l'origine ethnique \u00e9tait l'un des motifs pour lesquels il n'avait pas conserv\u00e9 son poste de directeur du projet Globe and Mail le 2 janvier 2002.\n[112] \u00c0 l'appui de ses all\u00e9gations qu'il a fait l'objet de discrimination de la part de M. Weich, M. Virk a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un \u00e9ventail d'exemples : premi\u00e8rement, que M. Weich n'embauchait des personnes d'origine sud-asiatique que dans les fonctions de soutien, deuxi\u00e8mement, que la majorit\u00e9 des membres du personnel de soutien dans la section de M. Weich \u00e9taient d'origine sud-asiatique et qu'aucun de ses directeurs n'\u00e9taient d'origine sud-asiatique, un fait qui est illustr\u00e9 par la pi\u00e8ce R-4, troisi\u00e8mement, que, depuis 1998, M. Weich n'avait jamais embauch\u00e9 un sud-asiatique comme directeur et, quatri\u00e8mement, que, en 1998, le seul sud-asiatique qui occupait un poste de directeur lorsque M. Weich s'est joint \u00e0 la section de gestion des vendeurs avait quitt\u00e9 dans les 12 mois de son arriv\u00e9e.\n[113] M. Virk a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 un courriel dat\u00e9 du 22 octobre 2001 pour montrer que les cinq directeurs adjoints dont les noms figurent dans le courriel sont tous de race blanche et que les gestionnaires \u00e9taient surtout de race blanche. M. Virk a toutefois confirm\u00e9 que parmi les personnes qu'il a relev\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant de race blanche, il y avait des personnes d'origine italienne, portugaise, irlandaise et grecque.\n[114] Dans le but d'\u00e9tayer davantage son all\u00e9gation qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de Bell, M. Virk a invoqu\u00e9 le fait que Bell n'a pas suivi l'\u00e9volution qui s'\u00e9tait faite dans le domaine des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans le monde du travail au Canada et que les personnes faisant partie de la haute direction de l'organisation du Centre de marketing direct de l'Ontario \u00e9taient toutes de race blanche.\n[115] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Weich a ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement avoir fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Virk en novembre 2001 parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique. Il a reconnu que M. Virk poss\u00e9dait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour conserver, \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002, le poste de directeur du projet du Globe and Mail et ce, en raison de son rendement. Toutefois, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la seule raison pour laquelle M. Virk avait repris son poste d'adjoint principal en janvier 2002 \u00e9tait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le poste de directeur du projet Globe and Mail, dans un contexte de restructuration, devrait \u00eatre combl\u00e9 par un directeur titularis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l'emploi de cette personne.\n[116] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de M. Virk que M. Weich avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard le 2 janvier 2002, l'intim\u00e9e a d'abord invoqu\u00e9 le fait que, par le pass\u00e9, M. Weich avait combl\u00e9 des postes de direction au sein de son groupe avec des personnes appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles et, deuxi\u00e8mement, que son groupe, en mars 2003, \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de personnes appartenant \u00e0 des communaut\u00e9s culturelles diff\u00e9rentes : Jama\u00efquains, Arm\u00e9niens, Indiens, Afghans, Sud-Am\u00e9ricains, Asiatiques de l'Asie m\u00e9ridionale, Noirs, Arabes, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9ens, Philippins, Asiatiques. Troisi\u00e8mement, l'intim\u00e9e a produit en preuve une photo prise \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2003 de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs de M. Weich pour illustrer sa pr\u00e9tention que les employ\u00e9s travaillant au Centre de marketing direct provenaient de diff\u00e9rentes communaut\u00e9s culturelles. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Virk a fait valoir que, sur la photo, il y avait trois personnes d'origine sud-asiatique mais qu'aucune d'elles n'\u00e9tait directeur des ventes. M. Weich a reconnu ce fait dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[117] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait pas embauch\u00e9 de personne d'origine sud-asiatique comme directeur depuis 1998, M. Weich a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il embauche, il recherche le meilleur candidat possible.\n(i) L'\u00e9tat du droit [118] Dans une cause en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, le fardeau de la preuve incombe au plaignant. Cela dit, la jurisprudence exige que le plaignant, afin d'avoir gain de cause, doive absolument, d'entr\u00e9e de jeu, faire une preuve prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination.\n[119] Dans l'arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., [2004] A.C.F. no 941, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, et Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Municipalit\u00e9), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, pr\u00e9voient les r\u00e8gles de base quant \u00e0 ce qui est exig\u00e9 d'un plaignant pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[120] Selon O'Malley, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. Selon Etobicoke, lorsqu'un plaignant \u00e9tablit prima facie qu'il est victime de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l'absence d'une justification de la part de l'intim\u00e9. La justification invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre un simple pr\u00e9texte ou un camouflage de sa conduite par ailleurs discriminatoire.\n[121] Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'intim\u00e9e est capable de prouver d'une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9terminante que la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en rapport avec le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite de discrimination, la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[122] Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans un contexte d'emploi, les tribunaux ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement renvoy\u00e9 aux d\u00e9cisions Shakes c. Rex Pak Limited, (1981) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, et Israeli c. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et la Commission de la fonction publique, (1983) 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1001. Dans Lincoln, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans Shakes et Israeli ne sont que des exemples de l'application des r\u00e8gles de base susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[123] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9e est d'avis que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination et que, advenant le cas o\u00f9 il l'aurait fait, l'intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 une explication qui n'est pas un simple pr\u00e9texte.\n(ii) Examen de la preuve [124] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk croyait fermement qu'il aurait d\u00fb continuer \u00e0 diriger le projet Globe and Mail le 2 janvier 2002 compte tenu de ses comp\u00e9tences et de son exp\u00e9rience et compte tenu du fait qu'il \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 que le directeur titularis\u00e9 qui l'a remplac\u00e9. Selon M. Virk, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 logique sur le plan commercial que Bell Canada retienne l'employ\u00e9 le plus qualifi\u00e9 comme directeur dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail.\n[125] M. Virk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait eu le sentiment, le 2 janvier 2002, que toutes ses r\u00e9alisations et toutes ses capacit\u00e9s n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate et future d'\u00eatre titularis\u00e9 comme directeur. La d\u00e9cision de ne pas le laisser continuer \u00e0 diriger le projet Globe and Mail lui a enlev\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de progresser dans sa carri\u00e8re comme directeur chez Bell Canada. Il ressort de la preuve que M. Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 humili\u00e9 et bless\u00e9 par le fait d'\u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'adjoint principal apr\u00e8s avoir occup\u00e9 le poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire.\n[126] \u00c0 maintes reprises dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, M. Virk a mentionn\u00e9 que, le 2 janvier 2002, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 de directeur int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 adjoint principal dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail et a fait valoir que cette r\u00e9trogradation \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au fait qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique et qu'il n'est pas de race blanche.\n[127] Par exemple, dans sa plainte, M. Virk fait valoir que l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en le r\u00e9trogradant. Il fait de plus valoir que, le 30 novembre 2001, son directeur associ\u00e9, M. Ted Weich, lui a dit qu'il serait d\u00e9mis de son poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire et se verrait confier un poste d'adjoint principal dans le cadre du m\u00eame projet, que sa r\u00e9trogradation n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 son rendement, que sa r\u00e9trogradation prendrait effet le 1er janvier 2002. Il affirme qu'il croit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 en raison de son origine nationale ou ethnique. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[128] Dans ses conclusions finales, M. Virk a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que Bell Canada avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au cours de son emploi en le r\u00e9trogradant en raison de son origine nationale ou ethnique et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. Selon M. Virk, le seul motif pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste d'adjoint principal non cadre le 2 janvier 2002 \u00e9tait son origine nationale ou ethnique, c'est-\u00e0-dire son origine sud-asiatique.\n[129] M. Virk a pr\u00e9tendu que les motifs fournis par Bell pour \u00e9tayer sa d\u00e9cision de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans son poste d'adjoint principal syndiqu\u00e9 le 2 janvier 2002 sont peu vraisemblables. Selon M. Virk, au moment de sa r\u00e9trogradation, il n'y avait aucune restructuration en cours chez Bell et l'on nommait toujours des directeurs int\u00e9rimaires. M. Virk conteste fortement que des directeurs titularis\u00e9s couraient le risque de perdre leurs emplois.\n[130] Le Tribunal estime que la preuve n'\u00e9taye pas l'all\u00e9gation de M. Virk qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 le 1er janvier 2002. Il ressort de la preuve que, en octobre 2001, M. Virk s'est vu accorder un poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail, lequel poste a pris fin lorsque le projet Globe and Mail fut temporairement arr\u00eat\u00e9 en novembre 2001. Le fait qu'une personne soit r\u00e9affect\u00e9e au poste syndiqu\u00e9 qu'elle occupait ant\u00e9rieurement ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, m\u00eame avec un effort d'imagination, comme \u00e9tant une r\u00e9trogradation.\n[131] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il ressort clairement de la preuve que, en novembre 2001, alors qu'on lui avait attribu\u00e9 un poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du projet Globe and Mail, M. Virk occupait un poste d'adjoint principal au sein du groupe de gestion des vendeurs de M. Ted Weich au Centre de marketing direct et \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9gi par la convention collective pour le personnel de bureau et les employ\u00e9s associ\u00e9s de l'ACET.\n[132] Comme il ressort de la preuve, le fait qu'une personne se voit confier une affectation int\u00e9rimaire n'est pas en soi une garantie que, \u00e0 la fin de cette affectation, la personne sera titularis\u00e9e comme directeur.\n[133] Le Tribunal estime que l'affectation de directeur int\u00e9rimaire de M. Virk dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail \u00e0 l'automne 2002 \u00e9tait de nature temporaire et qu'une fois l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire termin\u00e9e, il n'y avait rien de surprenant, contrairement \u00e0 ce que M. Virk pr\u00e9tend, \u00e0 ce qu'il soit r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste ant\u00e9rieur, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 celui d'adjoint principal.\n[134] Il ressort de la preuve que, avant son affectation int\u00e9rimaire au projet Globe and Mail, M. Virk n'avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 que de deux autres affectations int\u00e9rimaires, dont l'une n'\u00e9tait pas une affectation de directeur. Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que Mme Debbie Vieira a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de 8 affectations int\u00e9rimaires en 2002 et que ce n'est qu'en 2003 qu'elle est devenue directrice titularis\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, peu importe le nombre de postes de directeur int\u00e9rimaire qu'une personne a occup\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9, la titularisation comme directeur \u00e0 la fin d'une affectation int\u00e9rimaire ne s'obtient pas automatiquement.\n[135] Apr\u00e8s un examen attentif de la preuve, le Tribunal estime que l'intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi on avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Penno Makdessian, un directeur titularis\u00e9, de prendre \u00e0 sa charge le projet Globe and Mail en janvier 2002 et quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire de M. Virk n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9e apr\u00e8s d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[136] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Makdessian poss\u00e9dait l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de vente exig\u00e9e par le poste, que, compte tenu de l'\u00e9lan que Bell d\u00e9sirait donner au projet Globe and Mail, M. Makdessian \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le candidat id\u00e9al pour l'emploi. De plus, en raison du contexte de rationalisation qui pr\u00e9valait au Centre de marketing direct, la priorit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux directeurs titularis\u00e9s afin de prot\u00e9ger leurs emplois.\n[137] Le Tribunal est d'avis que, dans tout organisme, l'employeur a le droit de d\u00e9cider quel employ\u00e9 occupera telle ou telle fonction. De nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments peuvent entrer en jeu lorsqu'une telle d\u00e9cision est prise. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans Hill c. Air Canada, 2003 TCDP 9, il n'appartient pas au Tribunal de pr\u00e9ciser ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments; il n'a pas l'expertise n\u00e9cessaire pour ce faire. Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 voir si la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e en partie sur un motif illicite de discrimination.\n[138] Quant aux repr\u00e9sentations faites par M. Weich \u00e0 M. Virk le 30 novembre 2001 qu'il n'y aurait plus d'affectation de directeur int\u00e9rimaire ou de nouveau directeur dans son service \u00e0 compter de novembre 2001, et quant au fait que deux directeurs int\u00e9rimaires furent par la suite nomm\u00e9s, le Tribunal ne peut conclure ou inf\u00e9rer, compte tenu de la preuve, que M. Virk n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique ou que M. Weich lui a menti.\n[139] Le fait est que, en avril 2002, M. Virk s'est vu accorder un nouveau poste int\u00e9rimaire dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail, lequel poste il a occup\u00e9 jusqu'en octobre 2002. Il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 directeur des ventes int\u00e9rimaire du projet en ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[140] Le fait que M. Weich n'a jamais embauch\u00e9, depuis 1998, une personne d'origine sud-asiatique comme directeur ne prouve pas en soi ou ne fait pas na\u00eetre une pr\u00e9somption que M. Weich est une personne qui fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes d'origine sud-asiatique. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, lorsque M. Virk lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait pas embauch\u00e9 un directeur d'origine sud-asiatique depuis 1998, M. Weich a r\u00e9pondu que lorsqu'il embauche, il recherche le meilleur candidat possible pour l'emploi, quelle que soit l'origine ethnique de ce candidat.\n[141] Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve qu'il y a au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de gestion des vendeurs de M. Weich des personnes d'origine sud-asiatique qui ne semblent pas s'\u00eatre plaintes de discrimination de sa part. Aucune preuve en ce sens n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au Tribunal. De plus, il ressort de la preuve que M. Singh, le directeur titularis\u00e9 responsable du projet Globe and Mail entre octobre 2002 et ao\u00fbt 2003, est d'origine sud-asiatique.\n[142] Le fait qu'une liste de noms comprend plus de noms de personnes de race blanche (Italiens, Portugais, Irlandais, Espagnols) que de noms de personnes de toute autre origine ethnique, comme les personnes originaires de l'Asie du Sud-Est, d'Afrique, du Moyen-Orient ou de l'Extr\u00eame-Orient, ne donne pas en soi naissance \u00e0 une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination envers les personnes d'une origine ethnique particuli\u00e8re.\n[143] Il en va de m\u00eame du fait que, quant au nombre de directeurs appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles, une organisation comme Bell ne refl\u00e8te pas le profil national. Ce type de renseignements sera g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utile pour prouver que l'environnement de travail permet de conclure, selon le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, qu'il y a eu, selon toute vraisemblance, discrimination.\n[144] Quoi qu'il en soit, il y a une autre raison justifiant le rejet de la plainte de discrimination de M. Virk. L'argument de M. Virk repose en partie sur le fait que c'est M. Weich qui a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, lorsque, le 2 janvier 2002, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'adjoint principal et qu'on ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 diriger le projet Globe and Mail.\n[145] Il ressort de la preuve que c'\u00e9tait M. Latino qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'embaucher M. Makdessian comme directeur des ventes du projet Globe and Mail en novembre 2001 et de r\u00e9affecter M. Virk \u00e0 son ancien poste d'adjoint principal. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'all\u00e9gation faite par M. Virk contre M. Weich que ce dernier avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard parce qu'il \u00e9tait d'origine sud-asiatique lorsqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 ou titularis\u00e9 comme directeur du projet Globe and Mail en janvier 2002 n'est aucunement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve.\n[146] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9.\n[147] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve attentivement, le Tribunal conclut \u00e0 l'absence de fondement quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de M. Virk qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination lorsqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 titularis\u00e9 comme directeur ou lorsqu'il ne s'est pas vu accorder une nouvelle assignation de directeur int\u00e9rimaire dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail parce qu'il est d'origine sud-asiatique.\n[148] Le Tribunal conclut que l'explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi M. Virk n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 titularis\u00e9 comme directeur en janvier 2002 dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte et est tout \u00e0 fait cr\u00e9dible compte tenu de la preuve. Il conclut \u00e9galement qu'on ne peut pas raisonnablement conclure \u00e0 partir de la preuve que le fait de ne pas avoir offert \u00e0 M. Virk un poste de directeur dans le cadre du projet Globe and Mail \u00e0 l'automne 2001 \u00e9tait d\u00fb, en partie du moins, au fait que M. Virk \u00e9tait d'origine sud-asiatique.\n[149] Donc, compte tenu des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte de M. Virk, de la preuve et des crit\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans Etobicoke et O'Malley, de l'explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal juge que M. Virk n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nB. LA QUESTION DES REPR\u00c9SAILLES [150] Le 5 mars 2004, M. Virk a modifi\u00e9 sa plainte en all\u00e9guant que Bell Canada avait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[151] Dans sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, M. Virk all\u00e8gue que Bell a mis fin en novembre 2003 au projet Globe and Mail auquel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 et s'est servie de cette situation pour camoufler les repr\u00e9sailles qu'elle exer\u00e7ait contre lui.\n[152] M. Virk bl\u00e2me Bell et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Makdessian, pour l'avoir induit en erreur. Premi\u00e8rement, ce dernier ne l'a pas inform\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire appos\u00e9 au poste de Mme Anderson, c'est-\u00e0-dire le poste au Centre de contact en ligne, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e, l'emp\u00eachant ainsi d'exercer son droit de supplantation \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. M. Virk bl\u00e2me \u00e9galement M. Makdessian de ne pas l'avoir inform\u00e9 qu'il aurait pu supplanter, outre Mme Anderson, d'autres adjoints principaux ayant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 dans le groupe de gestion des vendeurs. M. Virk consid\u00e8re ces omissions comme \u00e9tant de la n\u00e9gligence ainsi que des actes de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Makdessian et d\u00e9clare que, s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de ces faits, il aurait exerc\u00e9 son droit de supplantation et travaillerait encore aujourd'hui chez Bell Canada.\n[153] M. Makdessian nie cat\u00e9goriquement qu'il ait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Virk lorsqu'il ne l'a pas inform\u00e9 du changement de statut du poste au Centre de contact en ligne, \u00e9tant d'avis que ce renseignement n'\u00e9tait pas pertinent quant \u00e0 l'exercice par M. Virk de son droit de supplantation. De plus, \u00e0 maintes reprises dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu que M. Virk lui avait clairement affirm\u00e9 qu'il se sentirait mal \u00e0 l'aise de supplanter une personne dans son poste et compte tenu qu'il tenait tellement \u00e0 ce principe, il n'a pas cru opportun d'informer M. Virk de ce changement.\n[154] Dans l'ensemble, Bell nie avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Virk parce que ce dernier avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne contre elle et affirme que toutes les d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en rapport avec le projet Globe and Mail et l'emploi de M. Virk chez Bell ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de nature purement commerciale.\n(i) L'\u00e9tat du droit [155] En vertu de l'article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[156] L'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d'acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte. Ce point de vue d\u00e9roge en partie \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles (Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] TCDP 11; Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004 CHRT 40).\n[157] Dans Wong et Bressette, les points de vue exprim\u00e9s portent qu'un plaignant n'a pas \u00e0 prouver une intention d'exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles et que si un plaignant per\u00e7oit raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 constitue des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, il pourrait \u00e9galement s'agir de repr\u00e9sailles, nonobstant l'absence de toute preuve de l'intention de l'intim\u00e9. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[158] C'est au plaignant qu'incombe le fardeau de prouver qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles et celui-ci doit prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la personne qu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence de la plainte, que cette personne a agi d'une mani\u00e8re inopportune et que l'inconduite de cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne par le plaignant. Les repr\u00e9sailles constituant une forme de discrimination en vertu de la Loi, le m\u00eame fardeau de la preuve devrait s'appliquer aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[159] Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve de la part du plaignant que la personne qui aurait exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence de la plainte et qu'elle aurait agi d'une mani\u00e8re inopportune peut donner naissance \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles exigeant que la personne qui aurait exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles fournisse une explication raisonnable quant aux motifs \u00e0 l'origine de ses actes. Si l'explication donn\u00e9e n'est pas cr\u00e9dible, le Tribunal doit conclure que l'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est justifi\u00e9e.\n(ii) Examen de la preuve [160] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n'est qu'en janvier 2003 qu'il a appris l'existence de la plainte de M. Virk. On n'a jamais prouv\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait fausse. La pr\u00e9tention faite par M. Virk que les repr\u00e9sailles avaient commenc\u00e9 en 2002 doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il reste donc \u00e0 examiner les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits apr\u00e8s janvier 2003, lesquels \u00e9v\u00e9nements M. Virk estime \u00eatre des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[161] Premi\u00e8rement, M. Virk estime comme \u00e9tant une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles le fait que M. Makdessian ne l'a pas inform\u00e9 du retrait de l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire accol\u00e9e au poste de Mme Karen Anderson au Centre de contact en ligne. La preuve d\u00e9montre que cette \u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 11 novembre 2003.\n[162] Il est incontest\u00e9 que M. Makdessian n'a pas inform\u00e9 M. Virk du retrait de l'\u00e9tiquette d'exc\u00e9dentaire accol\u00e9e au poste du Centre de contact en ligne. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises pourquoi il n'avait pas transmis ce renseignement \u00e0 M. Virk, M. Makdessian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu que M. Virk lui avait ant\u00e9rieurement fait clairement savoir qu'il se sentait mal \u00e0 l'aise de supplanter un coll\u00e8gue, M. Makdessian n'a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de l'informer du changement. De plus, M. Makdessian croyait que le changement de statut n'avait aucune influence sur le droit de supplantation de M. Virk.\n[163] Le fait que M. Virk n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le poste de Mme Anderson n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9limin\u00e9 ne prouve pas en soi qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. Compte tenu que le changement de statut n'avait aucune incidence sur le droit de supplantation de M. Virk, le Tribunal estime que ce fait ne constituait pas de l'information pertinente dans les circonstances. Si la preuve avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le contraire, on aurait pu tirer la conclusion que ce comportement inopportun constituait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Makdessian.\n[164] Deuxi\u00e8mement, M. Virk estime constituer un acte de repr\u00e9sailles le fait que M. Makdessian ne l'a pas express\u00e9ment inform\u00e9 qu'il aurait pu supplanter, outre Mme Anderson, quatre adjoints principaux qui travaillaient au Centre de marketing direct.\n[165] Il ressort de la preuve que, le 5 novembre 2003, les personnes qui assistaient \u00e0 la r\u00e9union convoqu\u00e9e par M. Makdessian ont \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement inform\u00e9es de la proc\u00e9dure de supplantation et qu'on leur a dit que s'ils d\u00e9siraient obtenir des d\u00e9tails sur la proc\u00e9dure, ils pouvaient s'adresser \u00e0 leur repr\u00e9sentant syndical ou \u00e0 leur directeur.\n[166] Il d\u00e9coule toutefois de la preuve que M. Makdessian n'a jamais donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Virk les noms des quatre adjoints principaux au sein du Centre de marketing direct qu'il aurait pu supplanter, outre celui de Mme Karen Anderson. M. Makdessian se devait-il de donner autant de pr\u00e9cision?\n[167] Le Tribunal conclut que rien dans la preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que M. Makdessian aurait d\u00fb donner les noms des personnes que M. Virk aurait pu supplanter et que, en ne le faisant pas, M. Makdessian a agi de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et a tent\u00e9 d'induire M. Virk en erreur quant aux diff\u00e9rents choix qui s'offraient \u00e0 lui. Il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 M. Virk de s'informer quant aux personnes qu'il pouvait supplanter.\n[168] Conscient du fait qu'il pouvait perdre son emploi, M. Virk aurait d\u00fb demander \u00e0 son syndicat, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la direction, des renseignements additionnels quant \u00e0 l'exercice de son droit de supplantation. Le fait est que M. Virk bl\u00e2me non seulement Bell Canada mais \u00e9galement l'ACET pour ne pas lui avoir fourni les renseignements dont il croyait avoir besoin pour savoir s'il devait d\u00e9cider d'exercer son droit de supplantation et il all\u00e8gue la n\u00e9gligence de la part de ceux-ci. Dans ce contexte, le Tribunal conclut que M. Makdessian n'a commis aucune faute et a encore moins commis une forme quelconque de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[169] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9cisive, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles.\nIV. CONCLUSION [170] Le Tribunal conclut que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'origine ethnique et que, quoi qu'il en soit, l'intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 titularis\u00e9 comme directeur du projet Globe and Mail en janvier 2002.\n[171] Le Tribunal conclut \u00e9galement que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli qu'il avait fait l'objet de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne lorsque M. Makdessian a omis de l'informer du changement de statut du poste au Centre de contact en ligne et de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il avait de supplanter des adjoints principaux autres que Mme Anderson.\n[172] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 20 janvier 2005\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT858\/10803\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nRoger Virk c.

LA REQU\u00caTE [1] La requ\u00eate est fond\u00e9e sur les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le Dr Shiv Chopra. La situation est assez simple. En raison de la longueur du litige, l'intim\u00e9 affirme qu'un certain nombre d'all\u00e9gations figurant dans les plaintes sont assujetties au principe de la pr\u00e9clusion. Elles ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es.\n[2] Le litige entre le Dr Chopra et l'intim\u00e9 dure depuis longtemps. Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9j\u00e0 comparu devant le Tribunal dans le cadre de deux litiges ant\u00e9rieurs avec l'intim\u00e9. Les parties se sont \u00e9galement affront\u00e9es en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ainsi que devant la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique. Je n'ai pas compt\u00e9, mais les parties se sont affront\u00e9es devant les tribunaux \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions.\n[3] Les pr\u00e9occupations principales de l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9coulent des conclusions tir\u00e9es par M. Hadjis dans Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) [2001] T.C.D.P. no 20 (QL). Elles d\u00e9coulent \u00e9galement des conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la Capitale nationale sur les relations interraciales (ACNRI) c. Canada (Sant\u00e9 et Bien-\u00eatre social), 1997 TCDP no 3 (QL), laquelle, toutefois, avait trait \u00e0 une plainte contre le m\u00eame employeur d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Puis, il y a l'autre litige.\n[4] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, l'intim\u00e9 me demande de radier certains aspects de la plainte. Cela pose un probl\u00e8me. Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et a le droit de superviser l'instruction. Il n'a toutefois aucun pouvoir sur la proc\u00e9dure de renvoi. C'est la Commission qui d\u00e9cide ce qui sera renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal. Je ne vois pas comment je peux radier des passages des plaintes sans implicitement miner l'autorit\u00e9 de la Commission et entrer dans le processus de renvoi.\n[5] Cela n'emp\u00eache pas le Tribunal de modifier les plaintes ou de d\u00e9cider de ce dont il est validement saisi. L'apport de modifications est une chose; la radiation en est une autre. Il existe des situations exceptionnelles, mais, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je ne crois pas que je puisse enlever des passages de documents dont l'origine est externe au processus. L'intim\u00e9 dispose d'autres sources de redressement. Je ne vois aucun probl\u00e8me, par exemple, avec une demande en radiation de paragraphes de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L'examen des plaidoiries rel\u00e8ve du cadre normal des fonctions du Tribunal.\n[6] Le probl\u00e8me en l'esp\u00e8ce est que les plaidoiries n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9es. Je crois que la phrase famili\u00e8re suivante r\u00e9sume le mieux la situation : les parties vont trop vite. Il est trop t\u00f4t pour traiter des subtilit\u00e9s de la cause et la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins convaincu qu'il serait utile de donner un certains nombre de directives aux parties.\nII. ALL\u00c9GATIONS SP\u00c9CIFIQUES [7] Il serait peut \u00eatre utile de formuler des observations sur les all\u00e9gations sp\u00e9cifiques qui concernent l'intim\u00e9.\nA. La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation [8] La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation concerne la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e omission d'avoir nomm\u00e9 le Dr Chopra au poste de directeur du Bureau de m\u00e9decine v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire en 1993. Je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9 pour affirmer que cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e.\n[9] L'observation la plus simple est chronologique. Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu une conclusion de discrimination pour les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s jusqu'en 1992. Toutefois, le Tribunal qui a conclu en sa faveur a re\u00e7u des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s entre 1992 et 1994. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la Commission, pour le compte du Dr Chopra, et ont manifestement fait partie de la plaidoirie du Dr Chopra. Il a eu l'avantage de disposer de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[10] M. Hadjis semble avoir trait\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve comme des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels, ce qui peut renforcer la cause du plaignant. Toutefois, je dirai simplement, \u00e0 ce moment-ci, que les parties sont li\u00e9es par ses conclusions. Si l'une ou l'autre des parties \u00e9tait insatisfaite de sa d\u00e9cision, elles pouvaient demander r\u00e9paration \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nB. La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation [11] La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation concerne une plainte interne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le Dr Chopra en 1993. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant une tentative de le discr\u00e9diter. M. Hadjis a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant ces aspects de l'affaire et il a conclu que les motifs de la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte n'\u00e9taient pas raciaux. Bien que l'on aurait tort d'entrer dans les d\u00e9tails de la d\u00e9cision de M. Hadjis, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que les parties sont li\u00e9es par ses conclusions.\n[12] M. Yazbeck va toutefois plus loin. Il d\u00e9clare que le plaignant veut produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant la fa\u00e7on dont l'intim\u00e9 a trait\u00e9 l'affaire. Il se peut ou non que cela soul\u00e8ve une nouvelle s\u00e9rie de questions dont je suis valablement saisi. Il est difficile de le dire \u00e0 ce moment-ci. Toute d\u00e9cision quant aux questions pr\u00e9cises qui pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard devra \u00eatre prise au moment appropri\u00e9.\nC. La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation [13] La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation a trait \u00e0 un document appel\u00e9 la note de service Cuddihy. Il semble que ce document ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans les trois audiences qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu. Il a manifestement jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la conclusion de discrimination de M. Hadjis.\n[14] Il y a deux aspects \u00e0 cette affaire. Le premier aspect a trait au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. \u00c0 ce stade, je ne vois pas pourquoi le plaignant aurait besoin de se fier au document, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal est d\u00e9j\u00e0 li\u00e9 par la conclusion de M. Hadjis qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1992.\n[15] Ces commentaires ne vident pas la question. Il peut \u00eatre encore n\u00e9cessaire de soumettre au Tribunal un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir le contexte dans lequel les \u00e9v\u00e9nements subs\u00e9quents se sont produits. Ces genres de questions devraient \u00eatre approfondies lorsque les all\u00e9gations essentielles en l'esp\u00e8ce auront \u00e9t\u00e9 clarifi\u00e9es, soit au cours des plaidoiries, soit au cours du t\u00e9moignage.\nD. La quatri\u00e8me all\u00e9gation [16] La quatri\u00e8me all\u00e9gation est que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas respect\u00e9 l'ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la Capitale nationale sur les relations interraciales (ACNRI) c. Canada (Sant\u00e9 et Bien-\u00eatre social). L'intim\u00e9 affirme que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 l'audience et n'a pas qualit\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il a soumis au Tribunal une lettre du pr\u00e9sident dans laquelle il est mentionn\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 a respect\u00e9 l'ordonnance. Je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9 que toute question de conformit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme le pr\u00e9voit la Loi.\n[17] L'affaire va plus loin. M. Yazbeck a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Dr Chopra a discut\u00e9 de la question de la conformit\u00e9 avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs. Je ne peux dire si ces conversations concernent l'essentiel des plus r\u00e9centes all\u00e9gations ou ont une incidence sur la pr\u00e9sente instruction. La pertinence de ce genre de preuve doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e au cours de l'audience, lorsque les circonstances permettent une \u00e9valuation ad\u00e9quate des int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu.\nE. La cinqui\u00e8me all\u00e9gation [18] Il y a \u00e9galement un diff\u00e9rend qui porte sur une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique concernant une suspension de cinq jours. Il y a eu un d\u00e9bat quant \u00e0 la signification exacte de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Ce n'est pas le moment, ni l'endroit pour discuter de questions juridiques techniques. \u00c0 ce stade, il suffit de dire que ce n'est pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de r\u00e9viser les conclusions tir\u00e9es et les d\u00e9cisions prises par un autre organisme d\u00e9cisionnel dans le cadre appropri\u00e9 de ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Il s'ensuit que les parties n'ont pas le droit de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau une question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Commission des relations de travail.\nF. La sixi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation [19] Enfin, il y a des all\u00e9gations concernant le fait que le Dr Chopra n'ait pas obtenu le poste de directeur du Bureau de m\u00e9decine v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire durant la p\u00e9riode de 1997 \u00e0 1998. Cela \u00e9tait bien apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de temps vis\u00e9e par les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures mais avant que M. Hadjis n'examine la question de la r\u00e9paration.\n[20] Je ne vois pas en quoi cela est important. Ces all\u00e9gations cadrent parfaitement avec les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes. Elles n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 M. Hadjis. Je ne vois pas comment on pourrait dire que les questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es par ces all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues. La pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIII. CONCLUSIONS [21] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Les questions qu'elle soul\u00e8ve n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bien d\u00e9finies par les parties. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions que les d\u00e9cisions rendues sur des questions de preuve ou de proc\u00e9dure devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es lorsque les int\u00e9r\u00eats pertinents sont d\u00fbment apparus devant le Tribunal. C'est une erreur de trancher ces questions trop t\u00f4t, avant que les r\u00e9percussions d'une quelconque d\u00e9cision ne soient devenues \u00e9videntes.\n[22] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne garantit \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. Je suis d'accord avec la Commission que le mandat du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, dans le processus menant \u00e0 l'audience, est r\u00e9gi par un principe de prudence. Le Tribunal devrait prendre soin de ne pas priver un plaignant de la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter l'ensemble de ses arguments devant le membre qui entend l'affaire. Il est beaucoup trop t\u00f4t dans le processus pour \u00e9tablir les param\u00e8tres pr\u00e9cis de l'instruction.\n[23] Je devrais ajouter que, selon moi, la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instruction est relativement large. Le plaignant a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de raconter son histoire au Tribunal, jusqu'\u00e0 1994 environ. L'histoire ne se termine toutefois pas l\u00e0. Il y a une suite. Si je comprends bien, il entend maintenant reprendre le r\u00e9cit et le continuer, jusqu'\u00e0 la date de cessation de son emploi. Il a le droit de faire cela.\n[24] Je crois que les parties conviennent qu'il serait erron\u00e9 d'envisager la tenue d'une autre audience dans l'avenir. L'un des objets vis\u00e9 par les instructions est d'apporter un certain caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif \u00e0 ce genre de diff\u00e9rend. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que le plaignant devrait se voir accorder la latitude dont il a besoin pour pr\u00e9senter toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination qui pr\u00e9vaut encore. Il est \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que cela r\u00e8glera une fois pour toute les questions en litige entre les deux parties.\nIV. D\u00c9CISION [25] Tout ce que je peux dire, sur la requ\u00eate, c'est que les parties sont li\u00e9es par les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures. Elles n'ont pas le droit de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau des questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es. Il appartient au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider, comme question de jugement, si les all\u00e9gations ou les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont semblables \u00e0 celles ou ceux qui ont fait l'objet d'une d\u00e9cision de la part d'un autre Tribunal. Les objections particuli\u00e8res devraient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es d\u00e8s qu'elles sont soumises.\n[26] Il peut-\u00eatre malgr\u00e9 tout n\u00e9cessaire de faire un quelconque renvoi aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont fait l'objet de d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, simplement aux fins de faire au Tribunal actuel un petit historique des relations entre les parties. Il s'agit d'une partie essentielle de l'instruction. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contextuels sont particuli\u00e8rement utiles dans le processus en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[27] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 ordonn\u00e9 aux plaignants de d\u00e9poser leurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cision au plus tard le 17 juin 2005. Si l'intim\u00e9 estime que les d\u00e9tails vont au-del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e l\u00e9gitime des plaintes, il devrait soulever la question le plus rapidement possible.\nM.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002, Jim Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tend que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (CN) a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] Le 19 mai 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Le CN sollicite maintenant une ordonnance mentionnant que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte parce que l'affaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par un autre organisme.\nI. L'historique [3] M. Smith a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le CN en avril 1979. En novembre 1997, M. Smith s'est bless\u00e9 au dos alors qu'il \u00e9tait en train de travailler. La Workers' Compensation Board lui a vers\u00e9 des indemnit\u00e9s d'accident du travail. Un certain nombre de d\u00e9marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises afin de r\u00e9tablir M. Smith dans son emploi de m\u00e9canicien de train. Ces d\u00e9marches n'ont pas fonctionn\u00e9.\n[4] En juin 2002, le syndicat de M. Smith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief en son nom dans lequel il pr\u00e9tend que la Compagnie a viol\u00e9 la convention collective en ne r\u00e9pondant pas aux besoins de M. Smith occasionn\u00e9s par sa d\u00e9ficience. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu par l'arbitre Michel Picher.\n[5] L'arbitre Picher a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 14 juillet dans laquelle il a rejet\u00e9 le grief. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, l'arbitre Picher a conclu que le CN s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de ses responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues dans la convention collective ainsi que dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne quant \u00e0 la question des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith.\n[6] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Smith et son syndicat ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre. Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2004, avant la tenue d'une audience sur le fond, la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\n[7] En juin et juillet 2003, M. Smith s'est vu donner la possibilit\u00e9 de suivre une formation pour un nouveau poste de contr\u00f4leur de la circulation ferroviaire \u00e0 Prince George (C.-B.). S'il r\u00e9ussissait le programme de formation, M. Smith devait se voir offrir le poste de contr\u00f4leur de circulation ferroviaire. Toutefois, le CN a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin au programme avant que M. Smith ne l'eut termin\u00e9.\n[8] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que le programme de formation eut pris fin, la WCB a mis fin au service de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle qu'elle fournissait \u00e0 M. Smith.\n[9] M. Smith a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision de la WCB de mettre fin \u00e0 l'aide qu'il recevait. La d\u00e9cision a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par un agent d'examen des indemnisations des travailleurs le 12 juillet 2004.\n[10] Le 29 juillet 2003, le CN a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne afin de demander que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que M. Smith avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2002 soit rejet\u00e9e au motif que les questions en litige dans cette plainte avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es au complet par l'arbitre Picher dans sa d\u00e9cision du 14 juillet 2003.\n[11] Le 19 mai 2004, la Commission canadienne sur les droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour qu'elle soit soumise \u00e0 une instruction.\nII. ANALYSE A. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal [12] M. Smith pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte pour qu'elle soit soumise \u00e0 une instruction ne peut pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Toutefois, selon moi, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ne comporte pas un examen de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[13] Elle comporte plut\u00f4t un examen de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal ainsi qu'une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e s'applique pour \u00e9carter la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la plainte (Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 22, paragraphes 13 et 14).\nB. Application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e [14] Vient un moment o\u00f9 l'on doit d\u00e9clarer la fin du combat. La doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e est l'un des dispositifs qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 par les cours de justice afin de fixer la fin indiqu\u00e9e d'un litige. Moyennant un certain nombre de modifications essentielles, la doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue aux tribunaux et aux agents administratifs.\n[15] Dans Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tabli une m\u00e9thode \u00e0 deux volets quant \u00e0 l'application de la doctrine dans le contexte des tribunaux administratifs. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape comporte un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets. Si tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re sont satisfaits, alors on passe \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape, laquelle comporte un exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal.\n[16] Les trois exigences qui doivent \u00eatre satisfaites lors de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'application de la doctrine de pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e sont les suivantes :\nla m\u00eame question est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion est finale; les parties ou leurs ayants droit dans la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e, sont les m\u00eames que les parties engag\u00e9es dans l'affaire o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 25).\n[17] Selon le CN, les trois exigences sont satisfaites en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[18] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Selon moi, une seule des trois exigences relatives \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e est satisfaite et, par cons\u00e9quent, la doctrine ne s'applique pas pour \u00e9carter la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la plainte de M. Smith.\n(i) La m\u00eame question est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e [19] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que les questions dont l'arbitre \u00e9tait saisi sont virtuellement identiques aux questions dont le Tribunal est pr\u00e9sentement saisi.\n[20] M. Smith, par contre, pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de savoir si le CN \u00e9tait tenu de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith dans sa ville natale de Terrace (C.-B.). Par contre, il pr\u00e9tend que la plainte dont est saisi le Tribunal s'\u00e9tend aux all\u00e9gations concernant la conduite du CN en rapport avec les mesures d'accommodement dans leur ensemble, ainsi qu'en rapport avec la demande d'indemnisation de M. Smith et avec la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin au programme de formation \u00e0 Prince George.\n[21] Selon moi, il est clair que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher portait en fait sur plus que sur la question des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace. Il a soulign\u00e9 que d\u00e8s que la Compagnie a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 envisager la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler ailleurs qu'\u00e0 Terrace, elle a s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 le poste de contr\u00f4leur de la circulation ferroviaire \u00e0 Prince George comme \u00e9tant une possibilit\u00e9. L'arbitre Picher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le CN quant au poste de Prince George, ainsi que ses efforts pour r\u00e9tablir M. Smith dans ses fonctions de m\u00e9canicien de train \u00e0 Terrace, constituaient une mesure d'accommodement raisonnable quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de M. Smith.\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher, portait en fait sur plus que la question des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith \u00e0 Terrace.\n[23] Toutefois, selon moi, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher ne portait pas sur l'ensemble des questions soulev\u00e9es par la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de M. Smith. Par la force des choses, sa d\u00e9cision s'est limit\u00e9e aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'audience. La plainte porte toutefois sur des all\u00e9gations d'actes de discrimination qui auraient commenc\u00e9 le 26 mars 2001 et qui se seraient poursuivis. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte englobe des all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l'audience d'arbitrage, comme l'abolition du programme de formation \u00e0 Prince George et les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles de la part du CN (voir Smith c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, D\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter une partie et \u00e0 modifier la plainte 2005 TCDP 23).\n[24] De plus, il appert du dossier que M. Smith n'a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de soumettre \u00e0 l'arbitre l'ensemble des questions et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant les solutions sur le plan des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 Terrace en raison de la d\u00e9cision de l'avocat du syndicat de ne pas le convoquer comme t\u00e9moin.\n[25] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les questions en litige dans la proc\u00e9dure de plainte sont diff\u00e9rentes des questions en litiges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par l'arbitre.\n(ii) Le caract\u00e8re final de la d\u00e9cision [26] Le Code canadien du travail pr\u00e9voit qu'une d\u00e9cision rendue par un arbitre est finale et lie les parties, sous r\u00e9serve de contr\u00f4le judiciaire demand\u00e9 sur le fondement d'erreur judiciaire. Bien que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, une proc\u00e9dure en contr\u00f4le judiciaire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite, elle a ult\u00e9rieurement fait l'objet d'un d\u00e9sistement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre \u00e9tait finale et que cette condition du crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite.\n(iii) Les parties ou leurs ayants droit sont les m\u00eames [27] Pour que la troisi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re soit satisfaite, les parties ou leurs ayants droit doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames. Il est clair qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, les parties dans les deux proc\u00e9dures ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Les ayants droit sont-ils les m\u00eames?\n[28] Pour qu'il y ait des ayants droit, il doit y avoir un degr\u00e9 suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun entre les parties pour qu'il soit juste de lier les parties \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue dans la premi\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 60). Les conclusions quant \u00e0 savoir s'il existe un degr\u00e9 suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun pour que les parties puissent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d'ayants droit de l'une et de l'autre doivent \u00eatre tir\u00e9es au cas par cas (J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman et A.W. Bryant, eds, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2e \u00e9d., 1999) page 1088)).\n(iv) Le syndicat et M. Smith en tant qu'ayants droit [29] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que parce que le r\u00e9gime de la convention collective supplante la relation qui existe entre la personne et l'employeur, les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. Smith ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9fendus que par la proc\u00e9dure de grief, notamment l'arbitrage. De plus, le syndicat est tenu, en vertu de l'article 37 du Code canadien du travail, de repr\u00e9senter d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable les employ\u00e9s de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation dans le traitement de leurs griefs.\n[30] Par cons\u00e9quent, le CN pr\u00e9tend que, dans le contexte de l'arbitrage, les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. Smith et ceux du syndicat sont les m\u00eames.\n[31] Le CN affirme que ses arguments sont \u00e9tay\u00e9s par des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal dans lesquelles celui-ci a conclu que le syndicat et l'auteur du grief \u00e9taient des ayants droit aux fins de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e (Thompson c. Rivtow Marine Ltd., [2001] T.C.D.P. no 47; Parisien c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 23; et Desormeaux, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\n[32] J'ai examin\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal invoqu\u00e9es par le CN et je conclus que rien dans ces d\u00e9cisions ne donne \u00e0 penser que, dans tous les cas, il y aura une communaut\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats entre le syndicat et l'auteur du grief\/plaignant. Au contraire, mon interpr\u00e9tation de ces d\u00e9cisions m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que, dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de ces affaires, le Tribunal \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que le syndicat et le plaignant \u00e9taient des ayants droit. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, il s'agit d'une conclusion qui doit \u00eatre tir\u00e9e au cas par cas.\n[33] Bien que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9 soient d\u00e9fendus par le syndicat, cela ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement que les int\u00e9r\u00eats du syndicat et ceux de l'employ\u00e9 sont toujours les m\u00eames. Des conflits surviennent entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats d'un employ\u00e9 et ceux de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation quant au traitement d'un grief (Re McRaeJackson [2004] C.C.R.I. no 31).\n[34] Le syndicat n'est pas tenu de r\u00e9pondre aux int\u00e9r\u00eats d'un employ\u00e9 dans les cas o\u00f9 cela nuirait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. Le devoir de juste repr\u00e9sentation ne fait qu'exiger que le syndicat prenne ses d\u00e9cisions quant au traitement d'un grief d'une mani\u00e8re juste et raisonnable (Canadian Merchant Service Guild c. Gagnon, [1984] 1.R.C.S. 509).\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, il n'est pas possible d'affirmer que, dans tous les cas, il y a une communaut\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats entre le syndicat et le plaignant. Chaque situation factuelle doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au cas par cas afin de d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure il existe une communaut\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[36] En l'esp\u00e8ce, un examen du dossier donne \u00e0 penser que bien que, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le syndicat et M. Smith partageaient des int\u00e9r\u00eats communs quant au r\u00e8glement du grief, il y avait de nombreux points de divergences qui, selon moi, sont suffisamment importants pour conclure que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le syndicat et M. Smith ne sont pas des ayants droit. Ces points sont les suivants :\n(1) Dans son affidavit, M. Smith d\u00e9clare que l'audition de son grief a dur\u00e9 deux heures et qu'aucun t\u00e9moin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Lors d'une pause, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'on lui permette de t\u00e9moigner pour r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations du CN. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par l'avocat du syndicat qui a affirm\u00e9 qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait souscrire au principe de la simplicit\u00e9.\n[37] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, M. Smith pr\u00e9tend qu'il disposait d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents quant aux possibilit\u00e9s d'occuper un autre emploi au sein de la compagnie et que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient cruciaux pour l'affaire que l'arbitre devait trancher. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'on l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ce t\u00e9moignage important.\n[38] Le CN ne conteste pas les affirmations de M. Smith concernant son d\u00e9faut de t\u00e9moigner. Toutefois, il r\u00e9torque que le t\u00e9moignage par affidavit de M. Smith \u00e9tablit que bien qu'il n'ait pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, il a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des suggestions \u00e0 l'avocat quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter sa cause. Le CN estime en outre que M. Smith \u00e9tait libre de suivre ou non le conseil de l'avocat du syndicat de ne pas t\u00e9moigner.\n[39] Selon moi, il n'est pas clair que M. Smith ait en fait eu ce choix. Alors que le protocole d'entente entre le CN et le syndicat cr\u00e9ant la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage pr\u00e9voit que chacune des parties a le droit d'interroger tous les t\u00e9moins et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'audience, c'est le syndicat et le CN qui sont parties au litige et non M. Smith (Protocole d'entente entre le CN et le syndicat cr\u00e9ant le Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer du Canada, dat\u00e9 du 1er septembre 1971, paragraphe 11). De plus, c'est le syndicat qui s'occupe du grief et non pas l'auteur du grief (Re McRaeJackson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 40).\n[40] Selon moi, le fait que M. Smith n'ait pas pu t\u00e9moigner durant l'audience d'arbitrage en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'il d\u00e9sirait le faire, est un facteur important lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer s'il existe une communaut\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats entre le syndicat et M. Smith.\n(2) La deuxi\u00e8me question qui milite contre une conclusion de communaut\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats entre M. Smith et le syndicat concerne la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre.\n[41] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2003, le syndicat et M. Smith ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre. Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2004, la demande a fait l'objet d'un d\u00e9sistement. L'avis de d\u00e9sistement a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par l'avocat du syndicat au nom de M. Smith et du syndicat.\n[42] Bien qu'il fut partie \u00e0 la demande, M. Smith t\u00e9moigne qu'on ne lui pas demand\u00e9 s'il consentait au d\u00e9sistement et que, si on le lui avait demand\u00e9, il n'aurait pas consenti. M. Smith d\u00e9clare que lorsqu'on l'a inform\u00e9 en mai 2004 que l'avocat du syndicat avait recommand\u00e9 le d\u00e9sistement de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, il a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'avocat du syndicat pour lui faire part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes et de ses objections. Malgr\u00e9 les objections de M. Smith, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der au d\u00e9sistement de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[43] Selon moi, les deux circonstances \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessus d\u00e9montrent que le degr\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats communs n'est pas assez \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour que l'on conclut que le syndicat et M. Smith sont des ayants droit en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(v) La Commission et M. Smith comme ayants droit [44] Le CN pr\u00e9tend que les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal dans lesquelles on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Commission n'est pas un ayant droit du plaignant sont erron\u00e9es (voir, par exemple : Rivtow Marine, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e; Parisien, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e; Desormeaux, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. 2004 TCDP 8).\n[45] Le CN affirme que la Commission ne poss\u00e8de qu'un statut accessoire quant \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, dans laquelle elle n'est pas le plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, les int\u00e9r\u00eats du plaignant et de la Commission sont \u00e0 ce point inextricablement li\u00e9s que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e devrait s'appliquer et lier la Commission \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure.\n[46] Je ne suis pas d'accord avec le CN sur ce point. Selon moi, les pr\u00e9tentions de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont pertinentes.\n[47] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que de pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle est un ayant droit du plaignant constitue une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e du cadre l\u00e9gislatif que le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9tabli quant au traitement des droits de la personne au Canada. L'article 51 de la Loi \u00e9tablit clairement que le r\u00f4le de la Commission est distinct de celui du plaignant.\n[48] La Commission repr\u00e9sente l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public devant le Tribunal. Ce faisant, elle doit tenir compte de la nature de la plainte, mais cela ne l'emp\u00eache pas de prendre une position diff\u00e9rente de celle du plaignant si l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public le justifie.\n[49] Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, une conclusion que la Commission est un ayant-droit du plaignant irait \u00e0 l'encontre des consid\u00e9rations de principe qui sous-tendent la Loi. Une telle conclusion aurait pour effet de lier la Commission \u00e0 des proc\u00e9dures auxquelles elle n'\u00e9tait pas partie et l'emp\u00eacherait, par cons\u00e9quent, de prendre devant le Tribunal des positions qui, selon elle, sont dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[50] Par ailleurs, la pr\u00e9sente situation diff\u00e8re de celle dont il est question dans la r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal quant \u00e0 une requ\u00eate dans Paulette Toth c. Kitchener Aero Avionics 2005 TCDP 19. Dans cette affaire, la Commission avait choisi de ne pas participer comme partie aux fins de savoir si la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e s'appliquait. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate sur cette question.\n[51] \u00c0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention que la Commission devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un ayant droit du plaignant, le CN invoque la d\u00e9cision Re Bouten and Mynarski Park School District No. 5012 (1982), 139 D.L.R. (3d) 651 (B.R. Alb.). Dans cette affaire, la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l'Alberta a conclu que l'Alberta Human Rights Commission \u00e9tait un ayant droit du plaignant.\n[52] M. Bouten travaillait comme professeur. Lorsque son emploi a pris fin, il a interjet\u00e9 appel aupr\u00e8s du ministre de l'\u00c9ducation car il pr\u00e9tendait que la cessation de l'emploi \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Il n'a pas eu gain de cause dans cette enceinte et il a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant l'Alberta Human Rights Commission. Avant d'entreprendre une audience sur le fond, la commission d'enqu\u00eate a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9cider si le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e s'appliquait et \u00e9cartait la comp\u00e9tence de la commission d'enqu\u00eate quant \u00e0 la plainte. La Cour a jug\u00e9 que, dans les circonstances de l'affaire, le principe s'appliquait.\n[53] Selon moi, le raisonnement suivi dans Re Bouten ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Alors que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a conclu que l'Alberta Human Rights Commission et le plaignant partageaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun quant au r\u00e8glement de la plainte, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et ceux du plaignant sont distincts. La Commission ne repr\u00e9sente pas le plaignant; la Commission a plut\u00f4t comme responsabilit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (voir par exemple : Desormeaux, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 31).\n[54] De plus, il faut souligner que dans la d\u00e9cision Re Bouten, M. Bouten, contrairement \u00e0 M. Smith, \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure dans laquelle la discrimination avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d'une cessation d'emploi. De plus, M. Bouten \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son propre avocat et avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure devant une commission de r\u00e9vision.\n[55] Ce n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le syndicat \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 l'arbitrage, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de M. Smith. Par cons\u00e9quent, si le CN veut respecter la d\u00e9cision Re Bouten, il aurait fallu qu'il pr\u00e9tende que le syndicat et la Commission sont des ayants droit. Il ne l'a pas fait. Pour ces motifs, j'estime que la d\u00e9cision Re Bouten ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[56] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que ni les parties, ni leurs ayants droit, \u00e9taient les m\u00eames dans les deux proc\u00e9dures. Par cons\u00e9quent, le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(vi) Deuxi\u00e8me partie du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Danyluk [57] Ayant conclu que deux des trois exigences relatives \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites, j'estime que je ne suis pas tenu de passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me partie du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Danyluk.\nIII. CONCLUSION ET ORDONNANCE [58] Je conclus que le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion pour chose jug\u00e9e ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la plainte n'est pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\n[59] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate du CN est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nI. L'article 14.1 de la Loi 10\n[1] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002, Jim Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tend que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (CN) a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le 19 mai 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[2] M. Smith demande maintenant que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e en vue d'ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es contre lui par le CN. Il demande \u00e9galement que la Workers' Compensation Board de la Colombie-Britannique (la WCB) soit ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 la plainte et que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e en vue d'y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de menaces de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de la WCB, et ce, au nom du CN.\n[3] Le CN ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 ce que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e en vue d'ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de sa part.\nI. L'historique [4] M. Smith a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le CN en avril 1979. En novembre 1997, M. Smith s'est bless\u00e9 au dos alors qu'il \u00e9tait en train de travailler. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande aupr\u00e8s de la WCB. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e et il a re\u00e7u des traitements de physioth\u00e9rapie ainsi que d'autres traitements pendant plusieurs mois, puis il est retourn\u00e9 au travail en avril 1998.\n[5] Malheureusement, l'\u00e9tat du dos de M. Smith s'est aggrav\u00e9 et, en mars 1999, M. Smith a d\u00fb subir une intervention chirurgicale. Celui-ci n'a pas travaill\u00e9 pendant le restant de 1999, mais il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 deux programmes de r\u00e9entra\u00eenement \u00e0 l'effort con\u00e7us pour augmenter la force et la souplesse dans le but d'un \u00e9ventuel retour au travail. Ces programmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 parrain\u00e9s par la WCB.\n[6] En janvier 2000, un conseiller m\u00e9dical pour la WCB a jug\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tat de M. Smith s'\u00e9tait stabilis\u00e9. La WCB a impos\u00e9 certaines restrictions quant aux activit\u00e9s professionnelles de M. Smith, mais elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il pourrait terminer le plan de retour graduel au travail \u00e9labor\u00e9 par le kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute et chirurgien orthop\u00e9diste qui s'est occup\u00e9 de son cas.\n[7] Le premier plan de retour au travail en 2000 consistait en une tentative de retour graduel de M. Smith au poste de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive qu'il occupait avant de se blesser. Ce plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u par un kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute \u00e0 l'emploi du CN. La WCB l'a approuv\u00e9 et a formul\u00e9 des recommandations afin que le retour au travail de M. Smith soit un succ\u00e8s. La WCB lui a \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e et des prestations pour soins de sant\u00e9, lesquelles prestations il devait recevoir jusqu'au 21 janvier 2001.\n[8] Le premier plan de retour au travail n'a pas fonctionn\u00e9. M. Smith a apparemment souffert de douleur au dos et de spasmes pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du plan. Il a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Appleton, \u00e0 propos de sa douleur au dos et de ses spasmes. Le Dr Appleton a recommand\u00e9 un examen neurologique et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Smith ne pouvait pas demeurer assis pendant plus de six heures.\n[9] La WCB a achemin\u00e9 pour examen le dossier m\u00e9dical de M. Smith \u00e0 l'un de ses conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 2 mars 2001, Mme C. Arujo, une gestionnaire de cas \u00e0 l'emploi de la WCB, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon l'opinion fournie par le conseiller m\u00e9dical de la WCB, M. Smith pouvait occuper le poste qu'il d\u00e9tenait avant de se blesser.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 compter du 21 janvier 2001, la WCB a cess\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 M. Smith ses prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e. Mme Arujo a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire car on avait estim\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait capable d'occuper le poste qu'il d\u00e9tenait avant de se blesser. Toutefois, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son dossier serait renvoy\u00e9 au Disablity Awards Department pour qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue quant \u00e0 un calcul d'incapacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle permanente.\n[11] M. Smith a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Workers' Compensation Review Board de la d\u00e9cision de la WCB qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'occuper le poste qu'il d\u00e9tenait avant de se blesser et que l'on devrait cesser de lui verser ses prestations.\n[12] Dans l'intervalle, le CN a con\u00e7u plusieurs autres plans de retour au travail auxquels M. Smith a particip\u00e9. Ceux-ci se sont en bout de ligne av\u00e9r\u00e9s infructueux.\n[13] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002, M. Smith a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le CN devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant avoir fait l'objet de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[14] En juin 2002, le syndicat de M. Smith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief en son nom all\u00e9guant que la Compagnie avait viol\u00e9 la convention collective en omettant de prendre des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins occasionn\u00e9s par la d\u00e9ficience de M. Smith.\n[15] Le 14 mars 2003, la Workers' Compensation Review Board a accueilli l'appel interjet\u00e9 par M. Smith de la d\u00e9cision de la WCB qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'occuper le poste qu'il d\u00e9tenait avant de se blesser et que l'on devrait cesser de lui verser ses prestations. Le Review Board a jug\u00e9 que M. Smith \u00e9tait incapable d'occuper le poste de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive. La Review Board a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 qu'il re\u00e7oive des prestations de continuit\u00e9 de revenu \u00e0 compter du 21 janvier 2001 ainsi que pour la perte de revenu \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit recycl\u00e9 dans un emploi adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, ce qui att\u00e9nuerait sa perte de revenus. Le CN a interjet\u00e9 appel de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[16] En avril 2003, le CN a propos\u00e9 que M. Smith suive une formation relative \u00e0 un nouveau poste de contr\u00f4leur de la circulation ferroviaire \u00e0 Prince George (C.-B.) durant les mois de juin et juillet 2003. S'il r\u00e9ussissait le programme de formation, M. Smith devait se voir offrir le poste de contr\u00f4leur de circulation ferroviaire.\n[17] M. Smith a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre le programme de formation en juin 2003. Il a termin\u00e9 un module d'autoformation \u00e0 Vancouver en juin, puis s'est rendu \u00e0 Prince George en juillet 2003.\n[18] Les 4 et 7 juillet 2003, M. Todd McDonald, un conseiller en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle \u00e0 l'emploi de la WCB, a communiqu\u00e9 par fax et par lettre avec M. Smith \u00e0 propos de sa participation au programme de formation et de ses chances de se voir offrir le poste \u00e0 Prince George.\n[19] Dans ces communications, M. McDonald a inform\u00e9 M. Smith que la WCB croyait que le plan de retour au travail \u00e0 Prince George \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quat, raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire pour que M. Smith puisse retourner au travail. Il a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point il \u00e9tait important que M. Smith participe volontairement au programme de formation de contr\u00f4leur de la circulation ferroviaire \u00e0 Prince George malgr\u00e9 le fait que lui et son syndicat eurent pris la position, dans le grief ainsi que dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, que l'on devrait prendre \u00e0 Terrace des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins.\n[20] M. McDonald a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 M. Smith que s'il continuait \u00e0 insister sur l'obtention d'un poste \u00e0 Terrace, de sorte que le CN ne pourrait pas lui offrir le poste \u00e0 Prince George, alors il pourrait devenir n\u00e9cessaire que la WCB examine le dossier afin de d\u00e9cider si on devrait fournir une aide suppl\u00e9mentaire de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle.\n[21] Le 9 juillet 2003, le grief du syndicat contre le CN a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu par l'arbitre Michel Picher. Le 14 juillet 2003, l'arbitre Picher a rendu une d\u00e9cision par laquelle il a rejet\u00e9 le grief. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, l'arbitre Picher a conclu que le CN s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de ses responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues dans la convention collective ainsi que dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) quant aux mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith.\n[22] Dans une note de service dat\u00e9e du 21 juillet 2003, Todd McDonald de la WCB a rapport\u00e9 une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui a eu lieu entre Tanya Gordon et le CN concernant les probl\u00e8mes du CN en rapport avec les co\u00fbts reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'implication continue de la WCB dans la cause de M. Smith, advenant le cas o\u00f9 M. Smith ne r\u00e9ussirait pas \u00e0 obtenir le poste \u00e0 Prince George. Selon la note de service, M. McDonald a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gordon que, compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve actuels figurant au dossier, M. Smith n'avait pas besoin de mesures d'accommodement suppl\u00e9mentaires quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de pouvoir s'\u00e9tendre au travail ou de pouvoir rentrer t\u00f4t chez lui.\n[23] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 2003, le CN a inform\u00e9 M. Smith que l'on avait mis fin au programme de formation \u00e0 Prince George. Le lettre mentionnait que bien que M. Smith f\u00fbt capable d'effectuer le travail de contr\u00f4leur de circulation ferroviaire \u00e0 Prince George, il devait d\u00e9montrer qu'il voulait vraiment apprendre le travail.\n[24] La lettre mentionnait \u00e9galement que M. Smith avait refus\u00e9 de suivre les directives quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d'inscrire correctement ses entr\u00e9es de journal et qu'il semble qu'il avait pris l'habitude de quitter son aire de travail et (ou) de laisser son travail sans surveillance pour des raisons non li\u00e9es au travail. La lettre mentionnait que d'autres [Traduction] observations objectives avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par les superviseurs du transport \u00e0 Prince George et qu'elles \u00e9tayaient la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin au programme.\n[25] Dans une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2003, qu'il a envoy\u00e9e au syndicat de M. Smith, M. McDonald de la WCB a sembl\u00e9 r\u00e9pondre aux accusations faites par le syndicat qu'il avait menac\u00e9 M. Smith dans les communications ant\u00e9rieures qu'il avait eues avec lui. M. McDonald a fait valoir que si le syndicat avait utilis\u00e9 le mot menacer dans le sens figurant dans le dictionnaire Webster, c'est-\u00e0-dire [Traduction] laisser craindre ou [Traduction] informer d'une sanction \u00e9ventuelle, alors il a pu menacer M. Smith. Toutefois, M. McDonald a soutenu que les communications qu'il avait eues avec M. Smith, lesquelles avaient trait \u00e0 sa demande d'indemnisation des accidents du travail, ne visaient tout simplement qu'\u00e0 informer ce dernier que son manque d'engagement \u00e9vident quant au programme de retour au travail \u00e0 Prince George pouvait avoir des cons\u00e9quences potentielles.\n[26] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er octobre 2003, Todd McDonald a inform\u00e9 M. Smith de la d\u00e9cision de la WCB qu'il ne pourrait plus b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'aide en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle dont il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait apr\u00e8s la fin du plan de retour au travail. M. McDonald a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que selon la WCB, le plan \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quat, raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire, qu'il tenait compte des restrictions des indemnit\u00e9s de M. Smith et permettait beaucoup de souplesse dans l'ex\u00e9cution du travail. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait des barri\u00e8res non indemnisables quant au retour au travail de M. Smith.\n[27] Ces barri\u00e8res comprenaient le manque de volont\u00e9 de la part de M. Smith \u00e0 se consacrer enti\u00e8rement au poste \u00e0 Prince George comme en t\u00e9moigne sa recherche continue quant aux possibilit\u00e9s de demeurer \u00e0 Terrace. De plus, la d\u00e9cision faisait part d'une incapacit\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e de la part de M. Smith \u00e0 travailler pendant des quarts de travail complets, et ce, sans que des restrictions m\u00e9dicales ne justifient cette incapacit\u00e9.\n[28] M. Smith a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision prise le 1er octobre 2003 par la WCB de mettre fin \u00e0 son aide en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle. Cette d\u00e9cision fut toutefois confirm\u00e9e le 12 juillet 2004 par un agent de r\u00e9vision des indemnisations des accident\u00e9s du travail.\n[29] Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 22 mars 2004, la Workers' Compensation Appeal Board a rejet\u00e9 l'appel interjet\u00e9 par le CN concernant la capacit\u00e9 de M. Smith \u00e0 travailler comme m\u00e9canicien de locomotive.\nA. Les positions des parties [30] M. Smith pr\u00e9tend que le CN a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui en nuisant \u00e0 l'arbitrage de ses demandes d'indemnisations aupr\u00e8s de la WCB, et ce, parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il d\u00e9clare de plus que l'abolition anticip\u00e9e par le CN du programme de formation \u00e0 Prince George constituait des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[31] Quant \u00e0 la WCB, M. Smith pr\u00e9tend que Todd McDonald l'avait menac\u00e9 que s'il ne retirait pas son grief ainsi que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ses prestations de la WCB cesseraient. Il pr\u00e9tend de plus que la cessation de ses prestations de la WCB \u00e0 la suite de l'abolition du programme de formation \u00e0 Prince George constituait des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es au nom du CN pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre le CN.\n[32] Bien qu'il n'admette d'aucune fa\u00e7on l'une ou l'autre des all\u00e9gations, le CN ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 cette partie de la requ\u00eate de M. Smith de modification de la plainte qui traite des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de la part du CN. Toutefois, le CN s'oppose \u00e0 la modification de la plainte visant \u00e0 ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de menaces de la part de la WCB \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Smith. Le CN adopte les pr\u00e9tentions de la WCB quant \u00e0 cette partie de la requ\u00eate.\n[33] La WCB pr\u00e9tend que la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu'il n'y a aucune chance que les all\u00e9gations figurant dans la modification concernant la WCB puisse \u00eatre accept\u00e9es. De plus, la WCB fait valoir que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l'endroit de la WCB, un organisme qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du gouvernement provincial.\nB. Les questions en litige [34] La premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si la WCB devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 la plainte. S'il est opportun d'ajouter la WCB comme partie \u00e0 la plainte, alors la question que l'on doit se poser est si la plainte devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e en vue d'ajouter les all\u00e9gations contre la WCB.\n[35] Toutefois, afin de d\u00e9cider si on doit ajouter la WCB comme partie \u00e0 la plainte, on doit d'abord examiner les exigences pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi concernant les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles et (ou) de menaces de repr\u00e9sailles au nom d'un intim\u00e9.\n(i) L'article 14.1 de la Loi [36] L'article 14.1 de la Loi mentionne que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e. Bien que le Tribunal ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de cas de repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par des intim\u00e9s, il n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par une personne agissant au nom de la personne contre laquelle une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[37] Afin de d\u00e9terminer ce que signifie l'expression celle qui agit en son nom, il convient d'examiner d'abord le contexte l\u00e9gislatif de la disposition.\n[38] L'article 4 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que les actes discriminatoires pr\u00e9vus aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 peuvent faire l'objet d'une plainte en vertu de la partie III et que toute personne reconnue coupable de ces actes peut faire l'objet des ordonnances pr\u00e9vues aux articles 53 et 54.\n[39] Le paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que sous r\u00e9serve de la disposition relative \u00e0 la diligence raisonnable pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 65(2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l'organisme ou l'association qui l'emploie. Par cons\u00e9quent, un organisme, par exemple, peut \u00eatre tenu responsable des actes discriminatoires de son mandataire s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans le cours de l'emploi. Toutefois, le mandataire ne devient pas personnellement responsable des actes discriminatoires par le seul effet du paragraphe 65(1)\n[40] En vertu de l'article 4 de la Loi, l'article 65 s'applique aux plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 14.1, ce qui a pour r\u00e9sultat qu'un organisme peut \u00eatre tenu responsable des actes de repr\u00e9sailles pos\u00e9s par son mandataire. Toutefois, encore une fois, le mandataire ne serait pas personnellement responsable de ses actes de repr\u00e9sailles par le seul effet du paragraphe 65(1).\n[41] Compte tenu que l'article 65 s'applique \u00e0 l'article 14.1, les mots qui agit en son nom qui figurent \u00e0 l'article 14.1 doivent avoir une autre signification que ce qui est exprim\u00e9 au paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi. Autrement, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter les mots qui agit en son nom \u00e0 l'article 14.1.\n[42] L'une des principales diff\u00e9rences est que, contrairement \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 65 de la Loi, la personne qui agit au nom d'un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins de repr\u00e9sailles est directement responsable d'un acte discriminatoire et peut faire l'objet d'une ordonnance en vertu des articles 53 et 54 de la Loi.\n[43] Il est possible de trouver une signification additionnelle des mots qui agit en son nom dans la version fran\u00e7aise de la Loi. Le libell\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais de l'article 14.1 d\u00e9crit la person acting on behalf of the respondent comme celle qui agit en son nom, c'est-\u00e0-dire une personne qui agit au nom de l'intim\u00e9.\n[44] Le libell\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais de l'article 14.1 dirige notre attention vers la deuxi\u00e8me des deux d\u00e9finitions figurant dans le Canadian Oxford Dictionary pour en son nom. Dans ce dictionnaire, l'expression est d\u00e9finie comme signifiant dans les int\u00e9r\u00eats d'une personne ou comme repr\u00e9sentant de.\n[45] Compte tenu de l'analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de du contexte l\u00e9gislatif de la disposition, je conclus que pour qu'elle soit vis\u00e9e par l'article 14.1, la personne qui agit au nom de l'intim\u00e9 doit exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles ou faire des menaces au nom de l'intim\u00e9 ou comme repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9. De plus, les mesures de repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es ou les menaces faites au nom de l'intim\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9es au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l'intim\u00e9.\n[46] Comme l'article 14.1 ouvre la porte \u00e0 ce que l'autre personne, en l'esp\u00e8ce la WCB, puisse faire l'objet d'une ordonnance en vertu de l'article 53 de la Loi, la personne doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 la plainte. Quel est le droit en mati\u00e8re d'ajout d'une partie \u00e0 la plainte?\nC. L'ajout d'une partie \u00e0 la plainte [47] Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 qu'il avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'ajouter des parties \u00e0 une instruction dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es (jugement de vive voix rendu le 2 octobre 2002 par la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton (T701\/0602), mentionn\u00e9e dans Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. Telus Comunications 2003 TCDP 31, paragraphes 23 \u00e0 27). Toutefois, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le contexte l\u00e9gislatif entourant ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire milite en faveur de la retenue ou de la prudence en mati\u00e8re d'ajout de parties.\n[48] Dans quelles circonstances convient-il d'ajouter une partie? De nombreuses d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal apr\u00e8s Desormeaux fournissent un certain nombre de r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 cette question.\n[49] Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Telus, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d'ajouter le syndicat comme partie \u00e0 la plainte. Parmi les facteurs qui militaient contre l'ajout du syndicat comme partie, il y avait le fait que rien dans les documents soumis au Tribunal ne donnait \u00e0 penser que le syndicat ou ses membres avaient agi, ou ont pu avoir agi d'une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire.\n[50] Le Tribunal dans Telus a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que l'ajout d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'instruction du Tribunal sur la plainte, alors qu'aucune plainte officielle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui, prive le nouvel intim\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter certains motifs de d\u00e9fense devant la Commission.\n[51] Dans Brown c. CCN 2003 TCDP 43, le membre Groarke a accueilli une requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vue d'ajouter Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada comme intim\u00e9 dans les proc\u00e9dures. Il a conclu que l'ajout de Travaux publics comme partie \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire si on voulait fournir au plaignant un recours appropri\u00e9 advenant qu'il r\u00e9ussirait \u00e0 prouver qu'il existait de la discrimination.\n[52] Par cons\u00e9quent, ce qui ressort des d\u00e9cisions rendues \u00e0 ce jour par le Tribunal quant \u00e0 cette question, c'est que la prudence est de rigueur lorsque l'on ajoute une partie. Une nouvelle partie ne devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'instruction que si l'ajout de la partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'on puisse trancher convenablement la plainte et s'il existe un fondement valide aux all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre la nouvelle partie.\n[53] En ce qui concerne ce dernier point, je tiens \u00e0 affirmer clairement que les exigences relatives \u00e0 la preuve d'un fondement valide quant aux all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre une nouvelle partie ne sont pas \u00e9lev\u00e9es. Le Tribunal n'entreprendra pas un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations. Toutefois, il reste qu'il doit y avoir un fondement valide aux all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre la nouvelle partie pour que l'exercice par le Tribunal de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'ajouter une partie soit justifi\u00e9.\n[54] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter qu'il peut y avoir un certain fondement quant aux all\u00e9gations que la WCB aurait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles et aurait menac\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Smith. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il existe un fondement valide quant aux all\u00e9gations que la WCB avait commis ses actes au nom du CN.\n[55] M. Smith fait valoir que les pi\u00e8ces au dossier suivantes \u00e9tayent les all\u00e9gations que la WCB agissait au nom du CN : (1) les documents relatifs aux discussions entre le CN et la WCB concernant les frais relatifs aux mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Smith; (2) les documents relatifs aux rencontres tenues entre la WCB et le CN pour discuter du retour au travail de M. Smith ainsi que du progr\u00e8s dans le programme de formation de Prince George; (3) les documents concernant l'acceptation par la WCB des positions du CN sur un certain nombre de questions.\n[56] Selon moi, ces documents n'\u00e9tablissent pas un fondement viable quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation que c'est au nom du CN que la WCB a commis ses actes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Smith.\n[57] L'article 16 de la Workers' Compensation Act de la Colombie-Britannique (la WCA) accorde \u00e0 la WCB le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de [Traduction] prendre les mesures et d'engager les d\u00e9penses qu'elle juge n\u00e9cessaires afin d'aider les travailleurs \u00e0 retourner au travail ou afin d'aider \u00e0 diminuer ou \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre une invalidit\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par un accident de travail ou une maladie.\n[58] Je crois qu'il convient d'inf\u00e9rer que, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de la WCA, afin de s'acquitter du mandat qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 16 d'aider les travailleurs \u00e0 retourner au travail, la WCB peut devoir travailler avec [Traduction] l'employeur de l'accident.\n[59] Selon moi, les documents auxquels M. Smith renvoie dans son dossier ne font rien de plus que de laisser supposer l'existence d'une relation de travail entre les repr\u00e9sentants de la WCB et le CN concernant le retour au travail de M. Smith. La preuve de l'existence d'une relation de travail n'est toutefois pas suffisante pour accorder quelque vraisemblance que ce soit \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation que la WCB agissait au nom du CN, ou afin de favoriser l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 du CN \u00e0 exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Smith pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte.\n[60] En d'autres mots, la preuve de l'existence d'une relation de travail entre les deux organismes ne soul\u00e8ve pas une pr\u00e9somption implicite que la WCB agissait au nom du CN en exer\u00e7ant apparemment des repr\u00e9sailles ou en mena\u00e7ant apparemment d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Smith.\n[61] En l'esp\u00e8ce il manque un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui, selon moi, est essentiel quant au succ\u00e8s de la requ\u00eate de M. Smith. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment consiste en des all\u00e9gations et en certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant la relation ou les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se sont produits entre la WCB et le CN et qui expliqueraient pourquoi la WCB agirait comme repr\u00e9sentant du CN contre M. Smith. Je ne vois rien dans les observations de M. Smith ou dans le dossier qui traite de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment manquant.\n[62] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu'il n'y a pas de fondement valide aux all\u00e9gations de M. Smith que la WCB a agi au nom du CN. Pour ce motif, je conclus qu'il ne convient pas d'ajouter la WCB comme partie \u00e0 la plainte. Selon moi, s'il ne convient pas d'ajouter la WCB comme partie \u00e0 la plainte, alors la demande de modification de la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Smith doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nII. Ordonnance [63] Compte tenu du fait que le CN ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la demande de modification de la plainte de M. Smith en vue d'ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de la part du CN, cette partie de la requ\u00eate est accueillie. La plainte devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence.\n[64] Toutefois, la demande d'ajout de la WCB comme partie et de modification de la plainte en vue d'ajouter les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de menaces de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de la WCB au nom du CN est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Introduction [1] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2000, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il avait fait l\u2019objet de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019emploi bas\u00e9e sur sa race, son origine nationale ou ethnique et sa situation de famille, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985), ch. H-6.\nII. Les faits [2] Le plaignant, Daniel Kasongo Sadi, est originaire de la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo. Apr\u00e8s ses \u00e9tudes secondaires, il a r\u00e9ussi un concours qui lui a permis de quitter son pays natal pour aller \u00e9tudier en Belgique, \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de Navigation d'Anvers, o\u00f9 il a pass\u00e9 trois ann\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la navigation maritime. Il quitte ensuite la Belgique pour l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie o\u00f9 il obtient un dipl\u00f4me de Lieutenant au Long Cours. Il travaille pendant deux ann\u00e9es dans le domaine de la navigation maritime mais devant l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir son livret d\u2019officier maritime, il s\u2019est vu oblig\u00e9 de r\u00e9orienter sa carri\u00e8re.\n[3] Il travaille alors comme musicien pour un certain temps et, finalement, il sera pris en charge par le Haut Commissariat aux R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, ce qui lui permettra de quitter le continent africain. On lui offrait l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019aller en Australie, aux \u00c9tats-unis ou au Canada. Ayant connu un professeur canadien en Alg\u00e9rie, il opte pour ce pays. Il arrive \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 14 octobre 1984. En 1988, il obtient la nationalit\u00e9 canadienne.\n[4] Au Canada, il d\u00e9cide de retourner aux \u00e9tudes et de choisir une nouvelle carri\u00e8re. Il s\u2019inscrit \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Concordia, de Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 il obtient, en 1991, un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9tude fran\u00e7aise (sp\u00e9cialisation en didactique du fran\u00e7ais). Il avait \u00e9galement obtenu, en 1990, de cette m\u00eame universit\u00e9 un certificat pour l\u2019enseignement du fran\u00e7ais langue seconde aux adultes.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son baccalaur\u00e9at, il agit pendant une ann\u00e9e comme agent d'accueil, \u00e0 titre b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, pour une association catholique, les Services catholiques pour immigrants, qui travaille alors avec Immigration-Qu\u00e9bec. Il donne des cours de fran\u00e7ais aux nouveaux immigrants. C\u2019est ce travail qui, selon son t\u00e9moignage, l'a motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 se sp\u00e9cialiser en enseignement du fran\u00e7ais langue seconde, aux adultes.\n[6] Il travaille ensuite \u00e0 la Commission des \u00c9coles catholiques de Montr\u00e9al de 1991 \u00e0 1998 o\u00f9 il enseigne le fran\u00e7ais langue seconde \u00e0 des adultes. En 1990-91, il commence une Ma\u00eetrise en linguistique \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al avec option sp\u00e9ciale en didactique du fran\u00e7ais. Il suit trois cours pour ensuite abandonner le programme. Dans son formulaire de plainte, le plaignant mentionne qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient une ma\u00eetrise en linguistique avec sp\u00e9cialisation en didactique du fran\u00e7ais ce qui, selon son curriculum vitae et son t\u00e9moignage, est inexacte. Lorsque contre-interrog\u00e9 sur cette inconsistance, le plaignant s\u2019embrouille dans des explications peu convaincantes. Il admet que c\u2019est une erreur et qu\u2019il y a d\u2019autres erreurs dans son formulaire de plainte ce qui \u00e9videmment met en doute la fiabilit\u00e9 de ce document.\n[7] Pendant cette m\u00eame \u00e9poque, il travaille comme journaliste pour Radio Centre-ville, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et comme r\u00e9dacteur et journaliste pour un journal appel\u00e9 Alternatives, pour lequel il effectue des reportages dans la r\u00e9gion des Grands Lacs en Afrique, et pour une revue nomm\u00e9e Afrique. Il r\u00e9alise aussi 24 \u00e9missions pour \u00c9chos d\u2019Afrique.\n[8] Durant son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, il occupera \u00e9galement les fonctions de directeur des relations publiques et responsable des projets pour une maison interculturelle pour l'accueil des immigrants, Safari Maison Interculturelle. Il est \u00e9galement directeur ex\u00e9cutif du Centre culturel africain \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[9] En 1997, il retourne au Congo (Za\u00efre), o\u00f9 il occupera pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019environ 6 mois le poste de directeur national de la Radio-t\u00e9l\u00e9vision nationale du Congo. Il revient, par la suite, au Canada rejoindre son \u00e9pouse qui \u00e9tait enceinte de leur deuxi\u00e8me enfant. En mai 1998, il prend la d\u00e9cision de partir vers l\u2019ouest canadien afin de se trouver du travail. Son intention est de se rendre en Colombie-Britannique mais son auto tombe en panne \u00e0 Regina, en Saskatchewan, o\u00f9 il d\u00e9cide de s\u2019\u00e9tablir pour chercher un emploi.\n[10] Son premier emploi, en Saskatchewan, sera avec le Conseil culturel fransaskois[1] Peu apr\u00e8s, il obtient un poste \u00e0 l\u2019Institut linguistique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Regina comme professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde aux adultes. Il d\u00e9bute ce travail \u00e0 temps partiel durant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Il enseigne alors le fran\u00e7ais langue seconde \u00e0 des techniciens de Radio-Canada.\n[11] En septembre 1998, il enseigne trois cours de fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l\u2019Institut linguistique. L\u2019Institut l\u2019a \u00e9galement embauch\u00e9 pour donner des cours de fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 des fonctionnaires, \u00e0 un juge et \u00e0 une dirigeante de l\u2019Universit\u00e9.\n[12] En mai 1999, il commence un nouveau travail \u00e0 Radio-Canada, \u00e0 temps partiel, pendant les fins de semaine. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 l\u2019Institut, il travaillera \u00e0 Radio\u2011Canada \u00e0 temps plein. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, il enseigne le fran\u00e7ais langue seconde aux adultes \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada.\n[13] Depuis novembre 2002, le plaignant travaille pour l\u2019\u00c9cole de la fonction publique du Canada, \u00e0 Ottawa, o\u00f9 il enseigne le fran\u00e7ais langue seconde aux fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[14] Dans son formulaire de plainte, il soutient avoir fait l\u2019objet de discrimination en emploi bas\u00e9e sur sa race, son original nationale ou ethnique et sur sa situation de famille, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[15] Il all\u00e8gue, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin juillet 1999, il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une annonce pour un poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du cr\u00e9dit agricole, maintenant Financement agricole Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e), parue dans les journaux de Regina, en Saskatchewan, il aurait envoy\u00e9 une lettre et son curriculum vitae, \u00e0 Madame Marie-France Kenny, directrice des langues officielles et de la traduction chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement dans son formulaire de plainte qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, au courrant de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000, son curriculum vitae pour un poste d\u2019agent charg\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et pour un poste de traducteur. Dans les trois cas, sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue.\n[16] Le plaignant fait \u00e9galement allusion dans son formulaire de plainte \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de n\u00e9potisme dans le processus de recrutement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il all\u00e8gue que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 francophone \u00e0 moins de faire partie de ce qu\u2019il appelle les grandes familles fransaskoises, il est difficile d\u2019obtenir un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant n\u2019a apport\u00e9 aucune preuve concluante pour soutenir cette all\u00e9gation autre que des impressions. Aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019est venu appuyer les perceptions du plaignant \u00e0 ce sujet. Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler qu\u2019il ne suffit pas de faire appel \u00e0 des impressions ou \u00e0 une preuve impressionniste pour \u00e9tablir une discrimination, il faut apporter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui soutiennent celle-ci. Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de croire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, qu\u2019il ait exist\u00e9 chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e le n\u00e9potisme dont fait mention le plaignant et je n\u2019ai \u00e9galement pas de preuve que seulement des membres de grandes familles fransaskoises soient favoris\u00e9es lors de l\u2019embauche. En raison de cette absence de preuve, je ne tiendrais pas compte de ces all\u00e9gations dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[17] Avant d\u2019aborder plus sp\u00e9cifiquement les plaintes du plaignant en ce qui concerne les diff\u00e9rents emplois pour lesquels il dit avoir postul\u00e9e, analysons quels principes juridiques doivent s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nIII. L\u2019analyse juridique [18] L\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e9tablit que c\u2019est une pratique discriminatoire que de refuser d\u2019employer une personne pour un motif de distinction illicite. La race, la couleur ainsi que l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique sont toutes des motifs de distinctions illicites.\n[19] Le fardeau de preuve, dans une affaire comme la pr\u00e9sente, incombe tout d\u2019abord au plaignant qui doit \u00e9tablir un cas prima facie de discrimination. (Voir : Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, 1618; Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; et, Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04.)\n[20] Un cas prima facie est celui qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui sont faites et qui, si on y ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict favorable au plaignant, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. (Ontario Human Rights Commission c. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au par. 28.) La question est donc de savoir s\u2019il y a une preuve, qui, en soi, \u00e9tablirait selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination.\n[21] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd , [2004] C.A.F. 204, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cisera, au paragraphe 22, que le Tribunal ne doit pas tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avant de conclure qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Elle ajoute que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau de preuve qui lui incombe.\n[22] Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, un cas prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme exigeant une preuve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui suivent :\nle plaignant avait les qualifications pour l\u2019emploi en cause; le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n\u2019avait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire : race, couleur etc.) a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste. (Shakes c. Rex Pak Lt\u00e9e (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, au paragraphe 8918.)\n[23] Ce crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019ajuster \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019est pas embauch\u00e9 et o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e continue de chercher un candidat appropri\u00e9. Dans ce cas, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un cas prima facie exige la pr\u00e9sence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nque le plaignant appartienne \u00e0 l\u2019un des groupes qui sont sujets \u00e0 la discrimination en vertu de la Loi, par exemple : motif religieux, handicap ou origine ethnique; que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9sirait combler; que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9; que, par la suite, l\u2019employeur a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats poss\u00e9dant les qualifications du plaignant. (Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, \u00e0 la page 1618.)\n[24] Dans Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, la Pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, Anne Mactavish, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, pr\u00e9cisera :\nBien que les crit\u00e8res des affaires Shakes et Israeli soient des guides utiles, aucun des deux ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 automatiquement d\u2019une mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire dans chaque affaire qui porte sur l\u2019embauchage : il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte des circonstances de chaque affaire pour \u00e9tablir si l\u2019application de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des crit\u00e8res, en tout ou en partie, est pertinente. En bout de ligne, la question sera de savoir si [le plaignant] a r\u00e9pondu au crit\u00e8re O\u2019Malley, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire si on y ajoute fois, la preuve devant [le Tribunal], est-elle compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du [plaignant] en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[25] Une fois la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie le fardeau de la preuve se d\u00e9place sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. S\u2019il donne une explication raisonnable pour ce qui serait autrement un comportement discriminatoire, le fardeau se d\u00e9placera \u00e0 nouveau vers le plaignant qui devra alors d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019explication \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte et que la v\u00e9ritable motivation derri\u00e8re les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait, en fait, discriminatoire.\n[26] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver les all\u00e9gations de discrimination par moyen d\u2019une preuve directe. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans Basi : La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la couleur se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rares sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. (Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. D\/5038.) Il appartient donc au Tribunal de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. (Premakumar, par. 79.)\n[27] La norme de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s : l\u2019on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible. (Premakumar, par. 81.) Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, cependant, que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient la seule raison des actes en cause pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accept\u00e9e. C\u2019est suffisant si la race, la couleur ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e9taient des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher. (Premakumar, par. 82; Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au para. D\/15.) Toutefois, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il ne suffit pas que la preuve circonstancielle soit compatible avec une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination; elle doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre incompatible avec d\u2019autres possibilit\u00e9s.\n[28] En effet, la preuve de discrimination poss\u00e8de des difficult\u00e9s qui lui sont propres. La plus importante est, sans contredit, le fait que des circonstances semblables peuvent se pr\u00eater \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes. Dans la d\u00e9cision Cecil Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et oc\u00e9ans, 2004 TCDP 36, mon coll\u00e8gue Paul Groarke pr\u00e9cisera, au paragraphe 107 :\nOn pourrait affirmer que l\u2019acte de discrimination r\u00e9side dans la diff\u00e9renciation. Le probl\u00e8me est que cette diff\u00e9renciation n\u2019existe pas ind\u00e9pendamment des actions des parties. Elle doit \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019on doit se servir de son jugement dans toute appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances qui donnent naissance \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination.\n[29] Le Tribunal doit \u00eatre prudent dans son \u00e9valuation de la preuve qui souvent est constitu\u00e9e d\u2019impressions. Dans Shakes, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 8918, la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate reconna\u00eet les limites de ce genre de preuve lorsqu\u2019elle cite le professeur Borins dans Kennedy c. Mohawk College (1973) :\nIl faut ajouter que la commission doit examiner la conduite dont on se plaint d\u2019une mani\u00e8re objective et non pas du point de vue subjectif de la personne qui all\u00e8gue la discrimination dont l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la conduite reproch\u00e9e pourrait bien \u00eatre d\u00e9form\u00e9e en raison des caract\u00e9ristiques inn\u00e9es de la personnalit\u00e9 comme un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de sensibilit\u00e9 ou une personnalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fensive importante.\n[30] Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Brooks, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, l\u2019utilisation du mot inn\u00e9es dans ce passage est malencontreuse. Toutefois, le point que voulait faire le professeur Borins est important. : un Tribunal doit \u00eatre prudent en se fiant aux perceptions des parties.\n[31] Voil\u00e0 donc les principes que je dois appliquer dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le formulaire de plainte, sign\u00e9 le 24 septembre 2000 par le plaignant, mentionne trois postes pour lesquels il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il y a eu de la discrimination :\nLe poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde. Le poste de conseiller en diversit\u00e9. Le poste de traducteur.\n[32] Le poste d\u2019agent bilingue de communications n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par le plaignant dans sa divulgation et lors de l\u2019audience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de l\u2019intention du plaignant de soulever cette question lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la divulgation de celui-ci, le 8 septembre 2004, et puisque aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019en d\u00e9coule pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a donc l\u2019intention de consid\u00e9rer les faits entourant cette question dans sa d\u00e9cision.\nA. Le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde [33] Le 31 juillet 1999, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait para\u00eetre une offre d'emploi dans The Leader Post, journal de langue anglaise de Regina, et dans l\u2019hebdomadaire de langue fran\u00e7aise L'Eau vive, pour un poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde. Selon l\u2019annonce, le titulaire du poste aurait \u00e0 dispenser des cours de groupe et des cours priv\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e9tudiants de diff\u00e9rents niveaux. Le postulant doit poss\u00e9der l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9velopper des programmes d\u2019apprentissage sur mesure pour les \u00e9tudiants. L\u2019annonce exige \u00e9galement une bonne connaissance du Programme de base de fran\u00e7ais au travail. Le candidat doit poss\u00e9der un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation, une excellente ma\u00eetrise du fran\u00e7ais oral et \u00e9crit, ainsi qu\u2019une vaste exp\u00e9rience en enseignement aux adultes. Le poste \u00e9tait offert sur une base contractuelle et le titulaire serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un travailleur autonome. Les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e9taient invit\u00e9es \u00e0 faire parvenir [leur] curriculum vitae, avant le 6 ao\u00fbt 1999, \u00e0 Marie-France Kenny, laquelle occupait alors le poste de directrice, Langues officielles et traduction chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Lors de l\u2019audience, elle occupait le poste de directrice, Langues officielles et partenaire d\u2019affaires en pratiques culturelles aux Ressources humaines.\n[34] Madame Kenny g\u00e8re la formation linguistique chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce titre, elle s\u2019est occup\u00e9e de pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel pour la s\u00e9lection du candidat, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du test \u00e9crit de fran\u00e7ais qui est un test standard chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle est responsable pour la pr\u00e9paration du guide d\u2019entrevue et des questions qui seront pos\u00e9es.\n[35] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Madame Louise Beaudoin, l\u2019adjointe administrative de Madame Kenny, une douzaine de personnes auraient postul\u00e9 pour ce poste. Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des curriculums vitaes des postulants, Madame Kenny dit avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9lection de ceux et de celles qui seraient invit\u00e9s \u00e0 passer le test \u00e9crit. C\u2019est Madame Beaudoin qui a contact\u00e9 les candidat(e)s retenu(e)s pour les inviter \u00e0 passer le test \u00e9crit. Madame Kenny s\u2019est charg\u00e9e de corriger les tests.\n[36] Puisqu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait que ce poste correspondait \u00e0 ses qualifications, le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poser sa candidature. La preuve d\u00e9montre d\u2019ailleurs que le plaignant poss\u00e8de une bonne exp\u00e9rience dans l\u2019enseignement du fran\u00e7ais langue seconde aux adultes.\n[37] Le plaignant dit s\u2019\u00eatre rendu en personne aux bureaux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour y d\u00e9poser une enveloppe, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Madame Kenny, contenant son curriculum vitae ainsi qu\u2019une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. La lettre de pr\u00e9sentation ne sera jamais produite en preuve. D\u2019ailleurs aucune lettre de pr\u00e9sentation pour aucun des postes pour lesquelles le plaignant dit avoir postul\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne sera produite en preuve. Les explications du plaignant quant \u00e0 l\u2019absence de ces lettres ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu et j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 douter de leur existence.\n[38] Le plaignant affirme avoir remis l\u2019enveloppe \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception. Cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0, Monsieur Fran\u00e7ois Magnin \u00e9tait le r\u00e9ceptionniste. Il affirme que seul le curriculum vitae fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9, sans lettre de pr\u00e9sentation et sans enveloppe. Il ajoute que si une enveloppe lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise, qu\u2019il aurait alors appos\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tampe Reception\/R\u00e9ception Received\/Re\u00e7u sur l\u2019enveloppe sans l\u2019ouvrir. L\u2019\u00e9tampe est appos\u00e9, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sur la copie du curriculum vitae du plaignant ce qui veut dire, selon M. Magnin, que le document lui fut remis sans enveloppe. Il indique \u00e9galement que si le plaignant lui avait mentionn\u00e9 que le document devait parvenir \u00e0 une personne en particulier, qu\u2019il aurait fait parvenir le document \u00e0 cette personne. Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de mettre en doute le t\u00e9moignage de Monsieur Magnin \u00e0 ce sujet. Il m\u2019est apparu comme un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible, fiable et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 du fait que sa conduite n\u2019est pas directement en cause dans cette affaire. Dans ces conditions, j\u2019accepte son t\u00e9moignage lorsque celui-ci sera en contradiction avec celui du plaignant.\n[39] Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Magnin qu\u2019il \u00e9tait venu pour le poste affich\u00e9 dans L\u2019Eau Vive et que M. Magnin lui aurait dit Le poste annonc\u00e9 par Marie-France Kenny, oui. Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, il admettra que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette conversation qu\u2019il aurait eue avec M. Magnin. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de M. Magnin \u00e0 celui du plaignant.\n[40] Le 4 ao\u00fbt 1999, soit quelques jours apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande, le plaignant re\u00e7oit une lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sign\u00e9e par Madame Tenille Nashiem, une stagiaire, pour Madame Misha Fafard. Madame Fafard occupait le poste d\u2019adjointe \u00e0 la dotation et relations de travail de la division des Ressources humaines. Cette lettre mentionne qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun poste chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e correspondant au profil du plaignant. La lettre l\u2019informe que son curriculum vitae sera gard\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans ses fili\u00e8res pour une p\u00e9riode de 6 mois. Selon Madame Fafard, c\u2019est une pratique normale chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019agir ainsi lorsqu\u2019un curriculum vitae est re\u00e7u sans indication pour quel poste la personne postule.\n[41] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, soit vers le 9 ao\u00fbt 1999, le plaignant dit avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 Madame Kenny, afin de comprendre ce qui n\u2019allait pas. Il a d\u2019abord parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Fafard qui lui explique qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u son curriculum vitae et que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 dans le dossier des demandes sans lettre de pr\u00e9sentation car il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas indiqu\u00e9 pour quel poste l\u2019auteur de la lettre postulait. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il postulait pour le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais, Madame Fafard l\u2019informe qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas au courant de l\u2019annonce de ce poste puisque les Ressources humaines ne sont pas impliqu\u00e9es dans sa dotation, laquelle rel\u00e8ve de Madame Kenny. Elle transfert donc l\u2019appel \u00e0 Madame Kenny. Madame Fafard ajoute qu\u2019elle est all\u00e9e chercher le curriculum vitae du plaignant et qu\u2019elle l\u2019a transmis \u00e0 Madame Kenny.\n[42] Lors de sa conversation avec le plaignant, Madame Kenny dit s\u2019\u00eatre rendue compte qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les qualifications de base n\u00e9cessaires pour postuler pour le poste. Elle l\u2019informe qu\u2019elle allait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer son curriculum vitae aux Ressources humaines, m\u00eame si la date pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des conditions \u00e9tait d\u00e9pass\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment.\n[43] Le plaignant fut convoqu\u00e9 au test \u00e9crit et, par la suite, \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue orale.\n[44] Au test \u00e9crit, le plaignant dit s\u2019\u00eatre class\u00e9 premier. Ce que confirmera d\u2019ailleurs Madame Nicole Bussi\u00e8res, membre du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue. Elle ajoutera cependant que tous les candidats avaient bien r\u00e9ussi le test \u00e9crit et que le classement avait finalement peu d\u2019importance puisque les quatre meilleurs r\u00e9sultats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus pour les entrevues. Madame Kenny pr\u00e9cisera que les r\u00e9sultats au test \u00e9crit et \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue n\u2019\u00e9taient pas cumulatifs.\n[45] Le plaignant sera donc invit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir passer une entrevue orale pour le poste d\u2019enseignant, le 19 ao\u00fbt 1999, \u00e0 9 heures. Les trois autres candidates invit\u00e9es pour une entrevue \u00e9taient Lorraine Lalibert\u00e9, C\u00e9line Merriman et Nicole Lemelin-Sarny.\n[46] L\u2019entrevue s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence de Madame Nicole Bussi\u00e8res, professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et de Madame Kenny. Madame Bussi\u00e8res est un travailleur autonome et non une employ\u00e9e de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que le plaignant rencontrait ces deux personnes autres que d\u2019avoir parl\u00e9 avec Madame Kenny au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone une fois auparavant. Le processus des entrevues \u00e9tait le m\u00eame avec tous les candidats.\n[47] Madame Kenny pr\u00e9cisera que sa r\u00e9action apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue du plaignant \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne. Elle ajoute avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s emball\u00e9e par l\u2019entrevue. Elle dit avoir trouv\u00e9 le plaignant dynamique et cr\u00e9atif. Elle aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Bussi\u00e8res que si les trois autres candidates ne faisaient pas l\u2019affaire cela n\u2019avait pas d\u2019importance puisque le plaignant \u00e9t\u00e9 un excellent candidat. Nicole Bussi\u00e8res, aurait \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 la candidature du plaignant tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante.\n[48] Au fur et \u00e0 mesure du d\u00e9roulement des entrevues, Madame Kenny et Madame Bussi\u00e8res disent avoir discut\u00e9 des candidats. Avant l\u2019entrevue de Madame Lemelin-Sarny, leur choix \u00e9tait toujours Monsieur Kasongo. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue avec cette derni\u00e8re, le choix \u00e9tait entre le plaignant et celle-ci. Madame Kenny dira qu\u2019elle penchait plut\u00f4t pour le plaignant mais que finalement, elles opt\u00e8rent pour Madame Lemelin-Sarny.\n[49] Selon Madame Bussi\u00e8res, les deux candidats sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Ce qui a fait pencher la balance en faveur de Madame Lemelin-Sarny, c'est le fait qu\u2019elle avait enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 deux \u00e9tudiantes de Madame Bussi\u00e8res lors d\u2019un cours d\u2019immersion d\u2019une semaine et que celles-ci l\u2019avaient fortement recommand\u00e9e. Le plaignant avait \u00e9galement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce cours, non \u00e0 titre de professeur mais dans une activit\u00e9 culturelle. Madame Bussi\u00e8res ajoute que si Madame Lemelin\u2011Sarny avait refus\u00e9 le poste, Madame Kenny et elle \u00e9taient d\u2019accord pour l\u2019offrir au plaignant.\n[50] Selon Madame Kenny, le plaignant aurait tr\u00e8s certainement pu s\u2019adapter \u00e0 l\u2019environnement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cependant, de la perception qu\u2019elle en a eu durant l\u2019entrevue, Madame Lemelin-Sarny, semblait pr\u00e9senter le package d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait. Elle allait, dans les mots de Madame Kenny n\u00e9cessiter moins d'encadrement. Elle ajoute que Madame Lemelin-Sarny a, pendant son entrevue, mis l\u2019emphase sur son exp\u00e9rience en enseignement, alors que le plaignant, tout en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait beaucoup de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, avait parl\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes exp\u00e9riences. Elle conclut qu\u2019elle aurait pu s\u2019accommoder de l\u2019un ou de l\u2019autre candidat mais qu\u2019elle s\u2019en est remise \u00e0 la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de Madame Bussi\u00e8res puisque c\u2019est cette derni\u00e8re qui allait avoir \u00e0 travailler avec le candidat retenu.\n[51] Quelques jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, Madame Kenny t\u00e9l\u00e9phone au plaignant pour l\u2019informer que le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre candidat.\n[52] Appliquons maintenant les principes juridiques d\u00e9crits plus haut \u00e0 ces faits. Le plaignant a \u00e9tablit qu\u2019il appartient \u00e0 un groupe susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre victime de discrimination d\u00fb \u00e0 sa race. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9tablit qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences acad\u00e9miques et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaires pour rencontrer les exigences du poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde. Les faits ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019une autre personne avec des qualifications similaires a re\u00e7u le poste et que cette personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de race noir. Le plaignant a donc \u00e9tabli, pour ce poste, une preuve prima facie de discrimination. D\u2019ailleurs, cette conclusion a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de s\u2019y attarder plus longuement\n[53] Le plaignant ayant rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, celui-ci se d\u00e9place maintenant sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n[54] Le processus de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9voyait, premi\u00e8rement, que les candidats int\u00e9ress\u00e9s fassent parvenir leur curriculum vitae, avant le 6 ao\u00fbt 1999, \u00e0 Marie-France Kenny. Fran\u00e7ois Magnin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u le curriculum vitae du plaignant, sans enveloppe mais surtout sans lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il avait comme pratique d\u2019accompagner son curriculum vitae d\u2019une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation et il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en appui des copies de lettres d\u2019accompagnement qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres circonstances. Toutefois, il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9senter une lettre d\u2019accompagnement pour le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde et ce manquement me porte \u00e0 conclure que cette lettre n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9e.\n[55] M. Magnin, le r\u00e9ceptionniste, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le plaignant ne lui avait pas indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il postulait pour un poste sp\u00e9cifique. Ainsi, suivant la pratique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le curriculum vitae du plaignant fut remis aux ressources humaines o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans le dossier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour \u00eatre conserv\u00e9 pour six mois. Encore une fois, suivant la pratique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, une lettre type fut envoy\u00e9e au plaignant le 4 ao\u00fbt 1999, l\u2019informant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste qui correspondait \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9tences. Le plaignant a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019intention de cette lettre comme une tentative de l\u2019exclure du processus. Or, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019un curriculum vitae est re\u00e7u par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que l\u2019auteur de la lettre n\u2019indique pas pour quel poste il applique, la pratique \u00e9tait de lui faire parvenir une lettre standard comme celle qui fut envoy\u00e9e au plaignant le 4 ao\u00fbt 1999.\n[56] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Fafard qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 que son curriculum vitae avait \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 dans le dossier des demandes sans lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. Apr\u00e8s avoir apprise que le plaignant postulait pour le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde, l\u2019appel fut transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame Kenny.\n[57] Madame Kenny, \u00e9tant convaincu que le plaignant poss\u00e9dait les qualifications de base n\u00e9cessaires pour postuler pour le poste, l\u2019a convoqu\u00e9 au test \u00e9crit et par la suite \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue orale et ceci m\u00eame si la date pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des candidatures \u00e9tait d\u00e9pass\u00e9e.\n[58] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces faits, je ne peux conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait eu, \u00e0 ce stade, l\u2019intention d\u2019exclure le plaignant de la proc\u00e9dure de s\u00e9lection. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. D\u2019ailleurs, je conclus que le plaignant est en grande partie, pour ne pas dire totalement, responsable de l\u2019imbroglio qui a suivi le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son curriculum vitae pour ce poste. S\u2019il avait suivi les directives clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019annonce du poste et s\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son curriculum vitae aupr\u00e8s de Mme Kenny, comme demand\u00e9, il aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 beaucoup de frustration.\n[59] Douze candidats, dont le plaignant, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s pour \u00e9crire le test de fran\u00e7ais. Quatre candidats, dont le plaignant, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis pour une entrevue orale le 19 ao\u00fbt 1999. Encore une fois, puisque le plaignant a franchi sans probl\u00e8me ces \u00e9tapes, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait essay\u00e9 de l\u2019exclure du poste en raison de sa race ou de son origine ethnique, \u00e0 ce stade.\n[60] Marie-France Kenny et Nicole Bussi\u00e8res \u00e9taient responsables de faire passer les entrevues aux candidats retenus. Aucune note digne de ce nom ne fut produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Nous devons donc nous en remettre \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire des participants afin de comprendre ce qui s\u2019est produit lors des entrevues.\n[61] \u00c0 celles-ci, deux candidates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exclues rapidement. En ce qui concerne le plaignant, Mme Kenny et Mme Bussi\u00e8res ont toutes les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fortement impressionn\u00e9es par son entrevue. Mme Kenny ajoutera qu\u2019elle savait, d\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue du plaignant, que quoi qu\u2019il advienne, elles avaient trouv\u00e9 un candidat acceptable. Toutefois, une autre candidate, la derni\u00e8re, Madame Nicole Lemelin-Sarny les impressionnera tout autant. Mme Bussi\u00e8res indiquera que les deux candidats \u00e9taient \u00e0 \u00e9galit\u00e9 mais que ce qui a fait pencher la balance en faveur de Mme Lemelin-Sarny, dans son cas, fut les commentaires positifs de deux \u00e9tudiantes qui avaient suivi une semaine d\u2019immersion \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Regina avec la candidate.\n[62] Pour sa part, Mme Kenny ajoute que m\u00eame si elle avait mieux cliqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant, elle consid\u00e9rait que Mme Lemelin-Sarny avait plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans l\u2019enseignement \u00e0 des anglophones alors que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du plaignant se situait surtout au niveau des allophones. Je dois avouer que cette conclusion de Mme Kenny me laisse pour le moins perplexe. Elle n\u2019a jamais expliqu\u00e9 en quoi cette exp\u00e9rience avec des allophones serait si diff\u00e9rente d\u2019une exp\u00e9rience avec des anglophones.\n[63] Madame Kenny pr\u00e9cise que lors de son entrevue, Mme Lemelin-Sarny lui est apparue plus mature, plus pos\u00e9e et structur\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle donnait l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle n\u00e9cessiterait moins d\u2019encadrement que le plaignant. Finalement, elle indique que lors de son entrevue, Mme Lemelin\u2011Sarny n\u2019a parl\u00e9 que de son exp\u00e9rience en enseignement, alors que le plaignant a parl\u00e9 de plusieurs sujets.\n[64] Mme Kenny ajoute qu\u2019elle s\u2019en est remise pour le choix final, \u00e0 Mme Bussi\u00e8res, puisque c\u2019est elle qui aurait \u00e0 travailler avec le candidat ou la candidate retenu. Elles d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent d\u2019offrir le poste \u00e0 Mme Lemelin-Sarny.\n[65] Une analyse des deux curriculums vitaes des candidats montre que le plaignant poss\u00e9dait une plus vaste exp\u00e9rience en ce qui concerne l\u2019enseignement de l\u2019anglais en tant que langue seconde aux adultes que Mme Lemelin-Sarny. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait surtout en mati\u00e8re d\u2019enseignement dans le syst\u00e8me scolaire publique.\n[66] Toutefois, je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que ce n\u2019est pas la t\u00e2che du Tribunal de juger de la justesse du bien-fond\u00e9 du choix de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans chaque processus d\u2019embauche, il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de subjectivit\u00e9. Le simple fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait utilis\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res subjectifs pour juger les candidats et qu\u2019il peut avoir commis une erreur en ce faisant, ne rend pas en soi sa d\u00e9cision finale susceptible de contestation au motif qu\u2019elle est discriminatoire. (Voir : Folch c. Ligne a\u00e9rienne Canadiens International Limit\u00e9e (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261, D\/303).\n[67] La preuve a montr\u00e9 sur quoi les candidats \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s et les raisons pr\u00e9cises pour lesquelles on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le plaignant ne serait pas le candidat retenu. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u2019accord ou en d\u00e9saccord avec le choix final pourvu que celui-ci n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour des motifs discriminatoires.\n[68] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, je suis persuad\u00e9 que pour ce poste, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rencontrer son fardeau et qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pu expliqu\u00e9 les raisons qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 choisir la candidature de Madame Lemelin-Sarny au lieu de celle du plaignant et rien dans ces explications ne laisse entrevoir que la race ou l\u2019origine ethnique du plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 une consid\u00e9ration.\n[69] Le fardeau se d\u00e9place donc \u00e0 nouveau vers le plaignant qui devra maintenant d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte et que la v\u00e9ritable motivation derri\u00e8re les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait, en fait, discriminatoire.\n[70] Dans la d\u00e9cision Folch, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a tenu \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser : Lorsque des crit\u00e8res subjectifs sont employ\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 l\u2019embauchage, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner plus minutieusement les d\u00e9cisions prises \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard afin de s\u2019assurer que les opinions subjectives ne servent pas \u00e0 masquer la discrimination.\n[71] Il est vrai que la discrimination est souvent invisible et que des personnes qui font de la discrimination ne se rendent pas habituellement compte qu\u2019elles le font. Cela ne signifie pas cependant que les autres ne s\u2019en rendent pas compte. Ainsi, en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, est-il possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il existe ici de subtiles odeurs de discrimination comme le d\u00e9crit si bien le tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e? Le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant fournit-il une preuve de cette odeur de discrimination? \u00c0 mon avis, non. Autre que des impressions, des perceptions et le fait qu\u2019il soit convaincu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le meilleur candidat, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve de sa part que la d\u00e9cision soit fond\u00e9e sur des consid\u00e9rations de race ou de couleur. Le contexte dans lequel le concours et les entrevues se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s ne d\u00e9montre pas non plus que la race ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dont a tenu compte l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[72] Aucune preuve ne vient \u00e9tayer la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant que la question de race ou d\u2019origine ethnique soit entr\u00e9e en consid\u00e9ration dans le processus de s\u00e9lection. La race ou l\u2019origine ethnique du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re plan, du processus de s\u00e9lection comme ce fut le cas dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brooks (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 119).\n[73] En raison de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant qu\u2019il y aurait eu discrimination du plaignant lors du processus d\u2019embauche pour le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\nB. Poste d'agent de communications bilingue [74] En ao\u00fbt 1999, l\u2019intim\u00e9e annonce un poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. La date pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des dossiers est fix\u00e9e au 6 ao\u00fbt 1999. Le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 en premier en Saskatchewan seulement. Aucun candidat satisfaisant n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9, le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau, le 7 octobre 1999, au niveau national.\n[75] Le titulaire du poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue travaille au sein d\u2019une \u00e9quipe responsable des communications internes, des relations avec les m\u00e9dias, de la r\u00e9daction d\u2019allocutions et de la pr\u00e9paration de rapports annuels. Le titulaire du poste doit poss\u00e9der une connaissance approfondie des m\u00e9dias canadiens et \u00eatre titulaire d\u2019un dipl\u00f4me en journalisme ou en arts. La ma\u00eetrise de l\u2019anglais et du fran\u00e7ais est essentielle pour le poste, d\u2019ailleurs, selon la classification de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le titulaire du poste devait atteindre le niveau professionnel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit et \u00e0 l\u2019oral, en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais.\n[76] Le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue ne faisait pas partie de la plainte initiale du plaignant. Lors de l\u2019audience, il fut fait mention du fait que la Commission n\u2019avait pas crue bon de retenir cette plainte car, selon l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, le plaignant ne semblait pas poss\u00e9der les qualifications requises pour le poste. L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice ne fut pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et les fondements de sa conclusion ne furent pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[77] Je note cependant que, le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000, la Commission a fait parvenir au plaignant une lettre accompagnant son formulaire de plainte, dans laquelle elle l\u2019informe, entre autres, qu\u2019elle ne retient pas ses all\u00e9gations concernant ce poste. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant dira que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il voit cette lettre. Il expliquera qu\u2019en juillet 2000, il avait pris la d\u00e9cision de retourner vivre en Belgique. Ce qu\u2019il a fait pour une certaine p\u00e9riode. Pourtant le 24 septembre 2000, il signe le formulaire de plainte qui accompagne la lettre sans demander de modifications \u00e0 celui-ci pour y ajouter le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. Je dois admettre que j\u2019ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 croire le plaignant lorsqu\u2019il dit n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u ou vu la lettre de la Commission avant l\u2019audience, alors qu\u2019il admet avoir re\u00e7u et sign\u00e9 le formulaire de plainte qui accompagne la lettre. Sur ce point, je n\u2019accepte pas le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant.\n[78] Je constate \u00e9galement d\u2019autres inconsistances dans le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant relativement \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation. Lors des entrevues avec l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, il soutiendra que le poste avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 comme un poste d\u2019agent de communications fran\u00e7ais et que ce n\u2019est que lors du deuxi\u00e8me concours que le poste aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 classifi\u00e9 comme un poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant admettra que cette information donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission \u00e9tait inexacte.\n[79] Malgr\u00e9 ces faits d\u00e9favorables au plaignant sur le plan de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9, pour les explications donn\u00e9es plus haut, de tenir compte de sa plainte concernant ce poste.\n[80] Selon le plaignant, suite \u00e0 son entrevue pour le poste d\u2019enseignant de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde, le 19 ao\u00fbt 1999, Madame Kenny l\u2019aurait suivi dans le corridor et lui aurait demand\u00e9 s\u2019il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. Elle lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 que si sa candidature n\u2019\u00e9tait pas retenue pour le poste de professeur, qu\u2019elle pourrait faire parvenir son curriculum vitae \u00e0 Madame Pam Bristol, responsable pour le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. Il affirme qu\u2019il connaissait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019existence de ce poste qu\u2019il avait vu annonc\u00e9 dans les journaux et que d\u2019ailleurs il avait soumis sa candidature pour celui-ci. Toutefois, il n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 cette information \u00e0 Madame Kenny car il craignait que cela lui pose probl\u00e8me pour le poste de professeur de fran\u00e7ais langue seconde. Il dit avoir accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre de Madame Kenny, mais \u00e0 contrecoeur, affirmant qu\u2019il avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019on le poussait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du concours pour le poste de professeur, propos qu\u2019il nuancera quelque peu lors de son contre-interrogatoire.\n[81] Selon Madame Kenny, cette conversation n\u2019aurait pas eu lieu \u00e0 ce moment mais bien quelques jours plus tard, lorsqu\u2019elle a contact\u00e9 le plaignant par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour lui annoncer que sa candidature pour le poste d\u2019enseignement n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Elle ajoute avoir alors inform\u00e9 le plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cherchait un agent de communications bilingue et lui a demand\u00e9 si elle pouvait faire parvenir son curriculum vitae au responsable pour la dotation de ce poste. Madame Kenny est all\u00e9e en personne remettre le curriculum vitae \u00e0 Pam Bristol. Ce qui sera confirm\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re.\n[82] Le plaignant fut invit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir passer les tests oral et \u00e9crit pour ce poste.\n[83] Les circonstances entourant le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue font appel aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Israeli c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le cas o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019est pas engag\u00e9 et o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e continue de chercher pour un candidat. Dans ces situations, le plaignant, pour \u00e9tablir un cas prima facie, doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il appartient \u00e0 l\u2019un des groupes qui sont sujets \u00e0 la discrimination en vertu de la Loi. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous n\u2019avons pas, pour les raisons \u00e9videntes exprim\u00e9es plus haut, \u00e0 nous attarder \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. Le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il rencontrait ce crit\u00e8re. Malgr\u00e9 certaines inconsistances au niveau de la preuve, je conclus \u00e9galement que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste.\n[84] L\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, rappelle que pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question \u00e0 savoir si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le Tribunal ne doit pas, \u00e0 ce stade, tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence, puisqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir passer les tests oral et \u00e9crit, je conclus que le plaignant \u00e9tait, pour les fins de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie, qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9sirait combler et que sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019employeur a, par la suite, continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des candidats poss\u00e9dant les qualifications du plaignant\n[85] La preuve prima facie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie le fardeau se d\u00e9place sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Madame Bristol et le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ont rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant. Selon Madame Bristol, le plaignant avait un portfolio impressionnant d\u2019articles r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en fran\u00e7ais. Il avait une personnalit\u00e9 agr\u00e9able et ajoute-t-elle l\u2019entrevue s\u2019est bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de s\u00e9lection suivante, soit l\u2019examen en communication en anglais. Madame Bristol pr\u00e9cise que la position requiert que le titulaire r\u00e9dige des textes surtout en anglais car le public desservit est majoritairement anglophone. C\u2019est Madame Bristol qui a corrig\u00e9 le test du plaignant. Elle dit s\u2019\u00eatre alors rendue compte que ses aptitudes en anglais, quoique bonnes, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas au niveau requis pour le poste. Sa candidature a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[86] Lors de l\u2019audience, le plaignant a produit un document qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 auparavant et qu\u2019il dit avoir retrouv\u00e9 dans une bo\u00eete de documents qu\u2019il venait de recevoir de la Saskatchewan. Ce document fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un \u00e9change de courriel entre Pam Bristol et lui. Dans son courriel le plaignant s\u2019enquiert de l\u2019\u00e9tat du dossier pour le poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue. Le 8 septembre 1999, Pam Bristol lui r\u00e9pond. Elle informe le plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est dans le processus de v\u00e9rifier les recommandations de l\u2019autre candidat qui, selon elle, a mieux r\u00e9ussi que le plaignant dans les \u00e9preuves d\u2019anglais parl\u00e9 et \u00e9crit. Elle indique \u00e9galement que puisque le poste requiert que le titulaire travaille 70 % du temps en anglais, que les comp\u00e9tences en anglais sont donc d\u2019une grande importance.\n[87] Quelques jours plus tard, Madame Bristol contacte \u00e0 nouveau le plaignant, cette fois par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, pour l\u2019informer que sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le poste. Elle mentionne que ses capacit\u00e9s de r\u00e9daction en anglais ne sont pas de publishable quality. Elle ajoute que le plaignant semblait d\u00e9\u00e7u mais non surpris du r\u00e9sultat. Puisque la candidature de l\u2019autre candidat, suite \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, fut \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9, le poste \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau.\n[88] Apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me annonce, le poste sera offert \u00e0 Monsieur Yves Breton. Monsieur Breton eut \u00e0 se soumettre aux m\u00eames \u00e9valuations orale et \u00e9crite que le plaignant.\n[89] Je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 une explication raisonnable des raisons qui l\u2019ont port\u00e9 \u00e0 rejeter la candidature du plaignant. Madame Bristol consid\u00e9rait que les habilit\u00e9s du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019anglais, oral et \u00e9crit, ne rencontraient pas les standards requis pour le poste. De plus, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience montre que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e9tait du m\u00eame avis et que le plaignant, en signant son formulaire de plainte sans exiger de modifications, reconnaissait le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[90] Le fardeau se d\u00e9place donc \u00e0 nouveau vers le plaignant pour qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre que l\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte et que la v\u00e9ritable motivation derri\u00e8re les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait, en fait, discriminatoire. Aucune preuve \u00e0 cet effet ne fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant. D\u2019ailleurs, la seule preuve pertinente est celle de Pam Bristol qui affirme que lorsqu\u2019elle a annonc\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision au plaignant, le plaignant semblait d\u00e9\u00e7u mais non surpris du r\u00e9sultat. Cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par le plaignant ni dans sa preuve, ni dans son contre-interrogatoire de Madame Bristol.\n[91] Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant qu\u2019il aurait subi une discrimination lors de la dotation du poste d\u2019agent de communications bilingue sont donc rejet\u00e9es.\nC. Poste de conseiller en diversit\u00e9 [92] Une annonce est parue dans L\u2019Eau vive, le 11 mai 2000, annon\u00e7ant une ouverture pour un poste de conseiller en diversit\u00e9. La directrice de la diversit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de postulant pour collaborer \u00e0 la planification, \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des initiatives de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans ce domaine. Les candidats devaient poss\u00e9der un dipl\u00f4me universitaire en ressources humaines ou dans un domaine connexe et de solides ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, remontant \u00e0 au moins trois ans, en diversit\u00e9, en \u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi et en gestion de projets en milieu de travail. Les candidatures avec curriculum vitae devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant le 19 mai 2000, aux Ressources humaines.\n[93] Madame Martine No\u00ebl-Maw, la directrice de la diversit\u00e9 t\u00e9moignera par affidavit. Dans son affidavit, elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019une personne qui poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences et avait de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de diversit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, puisque le poste \u00e9tait \u00e0 court terme et qu\u2019il fallait absolument avoir quelqu\u2019un qui connaissait les lois dans le domaine.\n[94] Le plaignant dit avoir postul\u00e9 pour ce poste. Le 30 juin 2000, il re\u00e7oit une lettre sign\u00e9e pour Madame Misha Fafard, par Pat Seidler, l\u2019adjointe administrative du vice-pr\u00e9sident aux ressources humaines. Cette lettre mentionne qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 ce moment aucune ouverture dans des postes qui correspondent \u00e0 vos comp\u00e9tences et \u00e0 votre exp\u00e9rience. Madame Fafard dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de cette lettre mais elle ajoute que cela \u00e9tait parfaitement normal, car comme elle l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le bureau des ressources humaines envoie automatiquement cette lettre standard dans le cas d\u2019un curriculum vitae non sollicit\u00e9s.\n[95] Le plaignant affirme que c\u2019est \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 enregistrer ses conversations avec les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il indique qu\u2019il a agi ainsi car il avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019il y avait des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s notoires qui [le] poussaient \u00e0 croire \u00e0 la marginalisation. Selon lui, chaque fois qu\u2019il postulait pour un poste, soit qu\u2019on lui indiquait que le curriculum vitae ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas rendu \u00e0 la personne responsable ou qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9gar\u00e9 dans l\u2019appareil bureaucratique. Toutefois, je ne peux conclure, sur la base de la preuve, \u00e0 ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s notoires dont parle le plaignant. Au contraire, l\u2019ensemble des circonstances d\u00e9montre plut\u00f4t une m\u00e9connaissance, de la part du plaignant, du processus de dotation de poste de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e9galement, comme les faits l\u2019ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9, une tendance, de sa part, \u00e0 exag\u00e9rer les faits. J\u2019admets que le plaignant a v\u00e9cu une p\u00e9riode difficile \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, toutefois rien dans la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne me permet de conclure \u00e0 une discrimination.\n[96] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de la lettre du 30 juin 2000, le plaignant a appel\u00e9 Madame Fafard. Il a parl\u00e9 en premier lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9ceptionniste, Madame Laurie Cinq-Mars, afin de savoir si elle avait remis son curriculum vitae \u00e0 Madame Fafard. L\u2019enregistrement de cette conversation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Dans celui-ci, Madame Cinq-Mars reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u le curriculum vitae du plaignant et l\u2019avoir remis \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qu\u2019elle n\u2019identifie pas. Elle ajoute que s\u2019il devait y avoir un poste, qu\u2019alors que le plaignant serait contact\u00e9. Elle transf\u00e8re ensuite l\u2019appel \u00e0 Madame Fafard. Voici les parties pertinentes de la transcription de cette conversation pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de l\u2019audition de la casette \u00e0 l\u2019audience:\n[\u2026]\nM. Kasongo : Euh... je vous appelle juste parce que, bon, vous m'avez dit que vous n'avez pas re\u00e7u mon c.v.\nMme Farard : Mm-hmm.\nM. Kasongo : Est-ce que...\nMme Farard : Vous \u00e9tiez suppos\u00e9 de l'envoyer par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur...\nM. Kasongo : Euh, parce que, bon, l\u00e0...\nMme Farard : ...la semaine pass\u00e9e, n'est-ce pas?\n[97] En effet, le plaignant avait auparavant contact\u00e9 Madame Fafard afin de savoir si elle avait re\u00e7u son curriculum vitae pour le poste de conseiller en diversit\u00e9. Elle lui aurait r\u00e9pondu non et le plaignant aurait dit qu\u2019il l\u2019avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception. Madame Fafard lui aurait alors sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de lui en faire parvenir une nouvelle copie par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la conversation enregistr\u00e9e par le plaignant, il semblerait qu\u2019il ne l\u2019ait jamais fait.\n[98] L\u2019enregistrement se poursuit :\nM. Kasongo : Oui. Mais justement, je voulais v\u00e9rifier... J'ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 avec la r\u00e9ceptionniste...\n[\u2026]\nM. Kasongo : ...qui m'a dit qu'elle vous a remis mon c.v. [Dans l\u2019enregistrement de la conversation avec Madame Cinq-Mars que nous avons \u00e9cout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, celle-ci ne dit pas avoir remis le curriculum vitae du plaignant \u00e0 Madame Fafard.] \u00c7a fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un mois que j'ai donn\u00e9 le c.v. pour, d'abord, le poste d'agent d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, et je n'ai pas re\u00e7u de nouvelles. C'est pour \u00e7a...\nMme Fafard: Quel... quel emploi? Excuse.\nM. Kasongo : C'\u00e9tait... Il y avait un poste ouvert. Vous avez annonc\u00e9 dans L'Eau vive...\n[\u2026]\nM. Kasongo : ...pour un agent charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi...\nMme Fafard : Oh! oui, oui.\nM. Kasongo : ...Equity Program. Yeah?\nMme Fafard: Oui. Hum, le... ce poste-l\u00e0, c'est rempli d\u00e9j\u00e0...\nM. Kasongo : Oui.\nMme Fafard : ...mais je t'ai parl\u00e9 la semaine pass\u00e9e, puis je pense que je t'ai dit d'envoyer votre c.v. parce qu'on a un poste en ce moment pour un traduc... un traducteur.\nM. Kasongo : Oui, oui, oui.\nMme Fafard : Est-ce que vous \u00eates int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 celui-l\u00e0?\nM. Kasongo : Mais oui, certainement! Mais j'\u00e9tais int\u00e9ress\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 l'autre, hein, sauf que, enfin, j'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Laurie, et l\u00e0, je voulais confirmer. Elle m'a dit qu'elle vous a d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9 mon c.v.\nMme Fafard : O.K.\nM. Kasongo : Oui. Et je...\nMme Fafard : \u00c7a, c'\u00e9tait pour l'autre poste.\nM. Kasongo : Oui, c'\u00e9tait pour l'autre poste...\nMme Fafard : Oui.\nM. Kasongo : ...et on garde dans le moment les c.v. pour six mois, je crois, chez vous.\nMme Fafard : Oui.\nM. Kasongo : Oui. Alors, est-ce qu'il faut que j'envoie encore un autre c.v.?\nMme Fafard : Ah! non, je peux chercher pour l'autre.\nM. Kasongo : Vous pouvez chercher l'autre c.v.?\nMme Fafard : Oui.\nM. Kasongo : Mais pourquoi est-ce que vous ne m'avez pas appel\u00e9 pour... au moins pour l'autre poste? Je voulais aussi... C'est pour \u00e7a que j'avais postul\u00e9.\nMme Fafard : Bien, c'est Martine No\u00ebl-Maw qui... qui s'occupait de ce... ce poste-l\u00e0. Alors, je sais pas pourquoi elle a pas appel\u00e9. D'habitude, on n'appelle pas des candidats, sauf si ils ont... ils sont s\u00e9lec... hum... ils sont choisis pour une entrevue.\n[\u2026]\nMme Fafard : C'est la fa\u00e7on qu'on... qu'on... \u00c7a dit \u00e7a sur toute notre...\n[\u2026]\nMme Fafard : ...notre annonce-l\u00e0 dans le journal.\n[\u2026]\nMme Fafard : \u00c7a dit que vous \u00eates... vous \u00eates contact\u00e9...\n[\u2026]\nMme Fafard : ...si vous \u00eates choisi pour une entrevue.\nM. Kasongo : O.K. Donc, je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour \u00e7a?\nMme Fafard : Oui.\nM. Kasongo : O.K. Est-ce que vous pouvez retrouver le c.v. pour le poste de traducteur?\nMme Fafard : Oui. Oui. Je... je peux... je peux bien le mettre pour le... ce poste-l\u00e0.\nM. Kasongo : O.K. Donc, ce n'est pas la peine que je vous envoie un autre c.v.?\nMme Fafard : Non.\nM. Kasongo : O.K. O.K. C'est \u00e7a que je voulais savoir avec vous, en tout cas.\n[\u2026]\n[99] Le plaignant confirme n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 ni pour l\u2019\u00e9preuve \u00e9crite, ni pour l\u2019entrevue pour le poste de conseiller en diversit\u00e9. Madame Martine No\u00ebl-Maw, affirme avoir s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 deux personnes pour passer des entrevues, soit une femme qui oeuvrait au gouvernement provincial de la Saskatchewan dans le secteur \u00e9quit\u00e9 et une deuxi\u00e8me personne, Don Racette, un autochtone, dont la candidature a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Elle dit n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u le curriculum du plaignant. Elle ajoute cependant qu\u2019ayant maintenant vu son curriculum vitae, elle ne l\u2019aurait pas retenu pour une entrevue car, selon elle, il n\u2019a ni les comp\u00e9tences, ni l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui \u00e9taient recherch\u00e9s pour ce poste. Le plaignant a choisi de ne pas contre-interroger Madame No\u00ebl-Maw et sa preuve \u00e0 ce sujet est demeur\u00e9e non contredite.\n[100] Encore une fois, le plaignant doit dans un premier temps \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, telle que nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9crite plus haut. Dans le cas de ce poste, le plaignant n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 ce fardeau car il n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences acad\u00e9miques et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaires pour rencontrer les exigences du poste. Il ne poss\u00e8de pas un dipl\u00f4me universitaire en ressources humaines ou dans un domaine connexe et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuves \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il avait de solides ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, remontant \u00e0 au moins trois ans, en diversit\u00e9, en \u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi et en gestion de projets en milieu de travail.\n[101] Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant concernant ce poste sont donc rejet\u00e9es.\nD. Le poste de traducteur [102] Le plaignant n\u2019a jamais postul\u00e9 pour ce poste. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t Madame Fafard qui a remis \u00e0 Madame Kenny le curriculum vitae du plaignant pour qu\u2019elle l\u2019inclue dans le dossier des postulants. En effet, suite \u00e0 la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu\u2019elle a eu avec le plaignant et dont il est fait mention plus haut, Madame Fafard t\u00e9moigne qu\u2019elle a trouv\u00e9 le curriculum vitae du plaignant dans le dossier o\u00f9 ceux qui ne sont pas accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation sont gard\u00e9s et de l\u2019avoir remis \u00e0 Madame Kenny afin que celle-ci le consid\u00e8re pour le poste de traducteur.\n[103] Le traducteur a pour t\u00e2che de traduire divers documents de toutes les divisions de l\u2019anglais au fran\u00e7ais (80 % du temps) et du fran\u00e7ais vers l\u2019anglais (5 % du temps.)\n[104] Selon Madame Kenny, m\u00eame si le plaignant n\u2019avait pas un baccalaur\u00e9at en traduction, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer sa candidature. Le plaignant est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir passer les \u00e9preuves \u00e9crites pour le poste de traducteur. Le 4 juillet 2000, il a subi l\u2019\u00e9preuve \u00e9crite, \u00e9preuve qu\u2019il a \u00e9chou\u00e9e selon Madame Kenny. Son texte avait selon elle des erreurs de terminologie, d\u2019accords et des anglicismes.\n[105] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant affirme que la candidate retenue n\u2019a pas pass\u00e9 la m\u00eame \u00e9preuve que lui. Toutefois, il n\u2019apporte aucune preuve pour appuyer ses conclusions d\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, autre que des soup\u00e7ons. Faute de preuves concr\u00e8tes, je ne peux retenir ces all\u00e9gations du plaignant. Des impressions et des soup\u00e7ons ne sont pas de la preuve.\n[106] Madame Kenny t\u00e9moignera que le test \u00e9crit est le m\u00eame pour tout le monde. Il est \u00e9tait fait \u00e9lectroniquement. Les postulants sont demand\u00e9s de pr\u00e9parer leur r\u00e9ponse et de la sauver sur une disquette qui est par la suite remise \u00e0 Madame Kenny. Dans le cas des candidats qui ne sont pas en mesure de se d\u00e9placer, par exemple les candidats qui seraient de l'ext\u00e9rieur de la province, le test est fait par l\u2019entremise d\u2019internet, et c'est l\u2019adjointe de Madame Kenny, Louise Beaudoin qui administre le test en l'envoyant au candidat. Le candidat a deux heures pour faire le test. Apr\u00e8s le test \u00e9crit, les candidats retenus sont invit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue orale.\n[107] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 le test, le plaignant a eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Madame Marie-France Kenny, qu\u2019il a \u00e9galement enregistr\u00e9 et dont voici certains extraits :\n[\u2026]\nMme Kenny :[\u2026]. Je t'appelais parce que j'ai revu ton test de traduction.[\u2026] Puis malheureusement, je n'ai pas retenu ta candidature pour une entrevue. Puis si tu veux, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 partager les corrections avec toi...[\u2026]...ou m\u00eame \u00e0 te les envoyer, puis tu vas voir de toi-m\u00eame l\u00e0. [\u2026] Il y a plusieurs choses. Il y avait plusieurs anglicismes, des choses comme \u00e7a, que m\u00eame si t'es un bon prof de fran\u00e7ais... [\u2026] je suis s\u00fbre que Nicole au m\u00eame test de traduction...[\u2026]...qu'il y aurait aussi... parce que vous n'enseignez pas les anglicismes, et c\u00e6tera.[\u2026]C'est pour \u00e7a qu'on demandait un bac en traduction, parce qu'il y a des choses qu'on apprend quand on fait notre bac en traduction...[\u2026]...qu'on n'apprend pas n\u00e9cessairement quand on donne des cours de fran\u00e7ais ou quand on prend son certificat ou, peu importe, son baccalaur\u00e9at\u2026[\u2026]...en fran\u00e7ais langue seconde. [\u2026] \u00c7a fait que, si tu veux, je n'ai pas de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 t'envoyer ton test. [\u2026] Je peux m\u00eame te l'envoyer par copie \u00e9lectronique si tu veux. [\u2026] Puis ce que j'ai fait, c'est que j'ai mis le...le tracking.[\u2026] Donc, tu vas pouvoir voir ce que j'ai ajout\u00e9 et ce que j'ai ray\u00e9.[\u2026]\u00c7a fait que \u00e7a sera tr\u00e8s visible pour toi l\u00e0... [\u2026]...pour que tu puisses le voir.[\u2026]Puis c'est pour \u00e7a que je t'avais appel\u00e9. Je l'ai corrig\u00e9, mais je voulais t'en parler en personne-l\u00e0. Je ne voulais pas t'envoyer une lettre, je voulais t'en parler directement.\nM. Kasongo : Exact. Pour la traduction-l\u00e0, je... je suis tout \u00e0 fait d'accord avec toi, hein. Je voulais juste tenter ma chance, et puis...[\u2026] Ce n'est pas ma sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, hein. [L\u2019emphase est de moi.]\n[\u2026]\n[108] D\u2019apr\u00e8s cet enregistrement que lui-m\u00eame a mis en preuve, le plaignant reconna\u00eet que la traduction n\u2019est pas sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 et qu\u2019en posant sa candidature il voulait simplement tenter sa chance. Il se dit \u00e9galement en accord avec les commentaires de Madame Kenny concernant son \u00e9preuve \u00e9crite. Lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve, le plaignant n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 nuancer ou expliquer ces propos.\n[109] Selon les faits, je me dois de conclure que le plaignant n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir dans le cas du poste de traducteur une preuve prima facie de discrimination, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 la satisfaction du Tribunal qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences de base requises pour occuper le poste.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [110] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent les plaintes du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019emploi bas\u00e9e sur sa race, son origine nationale ou ethnique et sa situation de famille, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985), ch. H-6, ne sont pas retenues.\n[111] Lors de son argumentation le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal, en s\u2019appuyant sur le paragraphe 50(6) de la Loi, d\u2019ordonner, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la plainte ne serait pas retenue, que le plaignant paie les frais des t\u00e9moins.\n[112] Le paragraphe 50(6) pr\u00e9voit :\nLes t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article peuvent, \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du membre instructeur, recevoir les frais et indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[113] Je ne crois pas que l\u2019objectif de ce paragraphe vise \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 une partie de solliciter des d\u00e9pens. L\u2019objectif de l\u2019article est d\u2019assurer que les t\u00e9moins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre puissent obtenir une certaine forme d\u2019indemnisation et pas plus. Ce serait en d\u00e9former le sens que d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il se peut que le Tribunal ait le pouvoir d\u2019accorder dans certaines circonstances des d\u00e9pens aux parties mais ce pouvoir ne se trouve certainement pas dans ce paragraphe.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 2 juin 2005\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T932\/5204\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Daniel Kasongo c.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Richard Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), le 7 septembre 2003, une plainte contre Tomasz Winnicki dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que M. Winnicki a utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser des messages susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 de la haine fond\u00e9e sur la religion. La Commission demande maintenant la modification de la plainte pour y ajouter les motifs de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. Le plaignant appuie la demande de modification.\n[2] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, M. Winnicki a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il fait l'objet de pers\u00e9cution de la part de M. Warman et de la Commission et que la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 inclure les motifs additionnels de la plainte constitue une autre preuve de cette pers\u00e9cution.\n[3] Le Tribunal dispose d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour modifier une plainte afin de traiter de motifs additionnels de distinction et d'all\u00e9gations additionnelles dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fond de la plainte originale est respect\u00e9 et o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u un avis suffisant pour lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e (Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 5).\n[4] Je suis convaincu que ces deux conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies en l'esp\u00e8ce. La modification propos\u00e9e est li\u00e9e au fond de la plainte originale \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les motifs additionnels se rapportent \u00e0 des documents qui ont soi-disant \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s par M. Winnicki sur Internet.\n[5] En outre, je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment m'indiquant que M. Winnicki subira quelque pr\u00e9judice que ce soit dans la pr\u00e9paration de sa d\u00e9fense si l'autorisation de modifier la plainte est accord\u00e9e. La divulgation des documents, y compris des documents qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur les nouveaux motifs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 M. Winnicki en avril 2005. De plus, en mai 2005, M. Winnicki a re\u00e7u avis des nouveaux motifs par l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions conjoint et l'avis de requ\u00eate de modification de la plainte.\n[6] Il est pr\u00e9vu que l'audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e9bute le 8 ao\u00fbt 2005. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Winnicki aura eu trois mois pour pr\u00e9parer une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur les nouveaux motifs. Il s'agit d'un avis suffisant pour s'assurer que M. Winnicki ne subisse pas un pr\u00e9judice du fait de la modification.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne l'autorisation de modifier la plainte de M. Warman pour inclure les motifs additionnels de la race, de l'origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Tomasz Winnicki en vertu du paragraphe 13(1). La Commission aura dix jours pour signifier et d\u00e9poser un formulaire de plainte modifi\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9 d'un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 et de tout autre document devant \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9par\nKaren A.

Introduction [1] La question de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des d\u00e9pens est actuellement en instance \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toutefois, il faudra un certain temps pour r\u00e9gler les aspects l\u00e9gaux de l\u2019affaire. Les parties m\u2019ont par cons\u00e9quent demand\u00e9 de taxer les d\u00e9pens de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, pendant que les d\u00e9tails du litige sont frais \u00e0 leur m\u00e9moire. Il appert qu\u2019il existe pour le plaignant une certaine urgence d\u2019aspect financier.\n[2] Les parties se sont entendues \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der et des principes de base qui devraient \u00eatre suivis pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la taxation. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que le Tribunal taxe officiellement les d\u00e9pens, j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de limiter mes commentaires aux rudiments du processus.\n[3] M. Bagambiire m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un m\u00e9moire de frais qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les honoraires et d\u00e9bours r\u00e9els qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 factur\u00e9s \u00e0 son client. La somme globale des honoraires, des d\u00e9bours et de la TPS qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame suivant le m\u00e9moire s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 372 612 $. C\u2019est ce montant qui constitue le v\u00e9ritable litige entre les parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du redressement.\nII. Les principes de base A. Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens est r\u00e9gi par le principe de l\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 [4] Selon ce que je comprends de la loi, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens est r\u00e9gi par le principe de l\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9. C\u2019est le terme utilis\u00e9 par M. Stinson dans l\u2019affaire Kassam c. Canada, [2005] A.C.F. no 799, au paragraphe 8 (C.A.F.), dans laquelle il dit qu\u2019un officier taxateur devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re classique, en tenant compte du [Traduction] sens de l\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui [Traduction] devrait s\u2019\u00e9tendre aux d\u00e9pens, pour emp\u00eacher que celui qui paie les d\u00e9pens subisse un pr\u00e9judice.\n[5] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un aspect fondamental du processus. L\u2019accent de l\u2019instruction lors de la taxation des d\u00e9pens porte sur ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 devrait payer plut\u00f4t que sur ce que le plaignant devrait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer. Cette diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019accent est importante. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenu de payer plus que ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019affaire.\n[6] Le processus de taxation des d\u00e9pens a sa propre caract\u00e9ristique particuli\u00e8re qui s\u2019appuie fortement sur le jugement de l\u2019officier taxateur. M. Stinson cite Lord Justice Russell, qui a apparemment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la taxation est [Traduction] une justice sommaire, dans le sens qu\u2019elle est compos\u00e9e d\u2019une approximation tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licate. Ce sentiment d\u2019impr\u00e9cision est probablement inh\u00e9rent au processus.\nB. La norme applicable est ce qui est \u00e9quitable et raisonnable [7] Il sera \u00e9vident qu\u2019une certaine sorte de norme est requise pour taxer le co\u00fbt appropri\u00e9 des services qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus. Les parties ont accept\u00e9 ma suggestion selon laquelle la norme applicable est ce qui est \u00e9quitable et raisonnable. La notion d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 apporte un crit\u00e8re additionnel qui refl\u00e8te la norme proc\u00e9durale pr\u00e9vue par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les frais peuvent \u00eatre raisonnables, mais pas totalement \u00e9quitables.\n[8] Il existe des d\u00e9cisions qui appuient ce point de vue. Dans la d\u00e9cision Smith c. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2005] O.J. no 2275 (Cour sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Ontario), la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario a trait\u00e9 d\u2019une adjudication de d\u00e9pens dans un appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une audience tenue devant le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario. La cour a reconnu, au paragraphe 2, le principe selon lequel [Traduction] les d\u00e9pens doivent \u00eatre raisonnables et \u00e9quitables pour la partie d\u00e9bout\u00e9e, dont les attentes raisonnables doivent \u00eatre prises en compte. La cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a confirm\u00e9 la m\u00eame norme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boucher c. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario, [2004] O.J. no 2634.\n[9] Le but de la taxation des d\u00e9pens consiste par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les d\u00e9pens \u00e9quitables et raisonnables du litige. Le processus de taxation devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9gi par le m\u00eame sens d\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui guide l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire plus large.\nIII. La fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der A. Les R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019appliquent [10] L\u2019ampleur de la demande dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire requiert une nouvelle m\u00e9thode de taxation. Dans le pass\u00e9, le Tribunal a adjug\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens sur le fondement qu\u2019ils constituent des d\u00e9penses suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ainsi, dans la d\u00e9cision Milano c. Triple K Transport Ltd., (2003) TCDP 30, et dans la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, no 2 (26 avril 2002), D.T. 03\/02 (TCDP), Mme Mactavish a adjug\u00e9 \u00e0 un plaignant des frais juridiques raisonnables. Dans la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, no 3 (29 mars 2001), D.T. 1\/01 (TCDP), elle a adjug\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens raisonnables entre procureur et client.\n[11] Les d\u00e9pens dont on a trait\u00e9 dans ces affaires \u00e9taient d\u2019une ampleur diff\u00e9rente de celle des d\u00e9pens r\u00e9clam\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ils se pr\u00eataient par cons\u00e9quent davantage \u00e0 cette analyse. J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente dans la d\u00e9cision Brown c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 30, dans laquelle j\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les frais juridiques ne devraient pas \u00eatre d\u00e9crits comme des d\u00e9penses suivant la Loi. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, ils seraient erron\u00e9ment trait\u00e9s comme des d\u00e9bours.\n[12] Cet aspect est important parce que les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du redressement pr\u00e9voient la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration totale des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es par un plaignant qui a gain de cause. Cela n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 quant aux d\u00e9pens. La notion du caract\u00e8re raisonnable qui s\u2019applique aux d\u00e9bours n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame que la notion qui s\u2019applique aux d\u00e9pens. La notion applicable aux d\u00e9pens est fond\u00e9e sur ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre tenu de payer plut\u00f4t que sur ce que le plaignant a d\u00e9pens\u00e9.\n[13] Il s\u2019agit plus d\u2019une norme consacr\u00e9e par l\u2019usage qui n\u00e9cessite certaines mesures pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la taxation de d\u00e9pens \u00e9quitables et raisonnables dans un cas donn\u00e9. M. Bagambiire a accept\u00e9 \u00e0 contrecoeur que les mesures de taxation puissent provenir des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ces R\u00e8gles fournissent un ensemble de principes et une fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der pour taxer les d\u00e9pens. Elles contiennent \u00e9galement un tarif, qui comporte une liste de services qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s. Cela fournit au processus de taxation la marche \u00e0 suivre.\n[14] Il est logique que les R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019appliquent. Des d\u00e9pens sont des d\u00e9pens. M. Brooks a droit aux m\u00eames d\u00e9pens que les autres parties \u00e0 un litige dans le syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il n\u2019est pas plus avantageux de d\u00e9poser une plainte suivant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En fait, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le plaignant a intent\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une poursuite fond\u00e9e sur la Constitution. Je ne vois aucune raison pour laquelle il obtiendrait un meilleur r\u00e9sultat devant le Tribunal.\n[15] Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de modifier le tarif pour refl\u00e9ter toute diff\u00e9rence dans les proc\u00e9dures devant le Tribunal. Comme M. Bagambiire l\u2019affirme, le tarif ne devrait pas \u00eatre un [Traduction] carcan. Je pense qu\u2019une certaine improvisation est une partie in\u00e9vitable du processus. Il est \u00e9galement possible de faire des ajustements, au d\u00e9but et \u00e0 la fin du processus.\nB. Tarif B [16] Les R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale contiennent deux tarifs. Le premier, le tarif A, traite des frais judiciaires. Les parties n\u2019y ont pas renvoy\u00e9. Il y a \u00e9galement un deuxi\u00e8me tarif, le tarif B, qui traite des honoraires des avocats et d\u00e9bours qui peuvent \u00eatre accept\u00e9s aux fins de la taxation des frais. Ce tarif contient un tableau qui donne un nombre d\u2019unit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es pour les services compris dans le tarif. Les parties ont reconnu que cela fournit la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der de base pour toute taxation par le Tribunal.\n(i) Le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir quels \u00e9taient les services n\u00e9cessaires et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la taxation des d\u00e9pens [17] La t\u00e2che d\u2019un tribunal qui applique le tarif comporte deux volets. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir quels \u00e9taient les services n\u00e9cessaires. Dans la plupart des cas, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une t\u00e2che relativement simple. Le plaignant pr\u00e9sente simplement un m\u00e9moire de frais exposant les services qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, conform\u00e9ment au tarif.\n[18] Le mot n\u00e9cessaire ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on trop stricte dans ce contexte. Il peut y avoir diff\u00e9rentes opinions quant \u00e0 ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire et le plaignant et son avocat ont le droit d\u2019exercer un certain jugement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[19] Le Tribunal doit ensuite \u00e9tablir le co\u00fbt de ces services selon la norme applicable. Cela requiert une certaine \u00e9valuation de la valeur \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents services. Cette valeur est fournie par le tarif, auquel s\u2019ajoutent les observations des avocats et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du Tribunal. Il appartient \u00e0 la partie qui demande des d\u00e9pens d\u2019\u00e9tablir le caract\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire et la valeur des services.\nC. La colonne appropri\u00e9e est la colonne III [20] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape suivant le tarif B consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider quelle colonne devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour la taxation. M. McCrossin a fait valoir que la colonne appropri\u00e9e est la colonne III. Il s\u2019agit de la colonne \u00e0 utiliser par d\u00e9faut suivant l\u2019article 407 des R\u00e8gles. M. Bagambiire a demand\u00e9 que les d\u00e9pens soient adjug\u00e9s suivant la colonne V, la colonne qui comporte les nombres les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s.\n[21] La question est celle de savoir si le plaignant a droit aux d\u00e9pens partie-partie ou aux d\u00e9pens sur une base avocat-client. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. c. Lee-Shanok, [1988] A.C.F. no 594, au paragraphe 27, dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[\u2026] un juge doit faire preuve [Traduction] de beaucoup de prudence lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9carte de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que seulement des frais entre parties soient accord\u00e9s \u00e0 un gagnant [\u2026]. Une telle adjudication extraordinaire [c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire des d\u00e9pens avocat-client ] ne doit avoir lieu que dans des circonstances clairement exceptionnelles, comme ce serait le cas lorsqu\u2019un arbitre d\u00e9sire indiquer de ce fait qu\u2019il d\u00e9sapprouve la conduite d\u2019une partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance.\nJe ne vois rien qui pourrait \u00eatre caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 d\u2019exceptionnel dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte.\n[22] Il y a occasionnellement eu de l\u2019agitation au cours de l\u2019audience. Les parties avaient des opinions fortes et ont fait \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le des all\u00e9gations de fa\u00e7on \u00e9motionnelle et m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on furieuse. Toutefois, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une portion habituelle du processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, processus qui soul\u00e8ve souvent des questions provocantes pour les parties. Je ne vois rien qui placerait la pr\u00e9sente affaire hors des cas habituels qui sont soumis au Tribunal.\n[23] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ne comportait pas un avantage par rapport \u00e0 une autre proc\u00e9dure. Je pense n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il peut y avoir un certain avantage dans des cas qui soul\u00e8vent des questions sociales, historiques ou institutionnelles devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es. Je pense qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de laisser d\u2019autres tribunaux trancher ces questions. La pr\u00e9sente affaire ne fait pas partie de tels cas.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il conteste un cas qu\u2019il attaque l\u00e9gitimement. La colonne appropri\u00e9e est clairement la colonne III. Il existait un v\u00e9ritable litige entre les parties. Les parties ont eu toutes deux des gains de cause.\nD. Taxation [25] Les parties ont convenu d\u2019appliquer le tarif B, article par article, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re relativement peu formelle. J\u2019ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque partie la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations et j\u2019ai ensuite adjug\u00e9 un nombre d\u2019unit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis pour le service. La valeur de chaque unit\u00e9 au moment de l\u2019audience tenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la taxation \u00e9tait de 110 $. Cette valeur a chang\u00e9 pour 120 $ le 1er avril 2005.\n[26] Les parties ont adopt\u00e9 des positions diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la valeur qui devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente adjudication de d\u00e9pens. M. Bagambiire pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en date du 1er avril 2005, lorsque la valeur unitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajust\u00e9e. Il m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale AIC Ltd. c. Infinity Investment Counsel Ltd., [1998] A.C.F. no 904, dans laquelle le juge Rothstein a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un nouvel article des R\u00e8gles se rapportant aux d\u00e9pens devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 une adjudication de d\u00e9pens qui survient apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de cet article.\n[27] Les parties conviennent essentiellement que la question est celle de savoir si les droits suivant l\u2019adjudication \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquis. Mme Cameron, au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9, pr\u00e9tend que les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis au cours de la taxation qui a eu lieu avant le 1er avril. Les points qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 1er avril se rapportaient \u00e0 des questions de droit et \u00e0 la question g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de savoir si je devais exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu par les R\u00e8gles d\u2019augmenter ou de r\u00e9duire les d\u00e9pens tax\u00e9s.\n[28] Je pense que les deux parties reconna\u00eetront que le nombre d\u2019unit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre adjug\u00e9es pour chaque service a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli au moment de l\u2019audience tenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la taxation. Des observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque article et, sauf en cas d\u2019erreurs ou de contradictions, je pense que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de taxer ces d\u00e9pens a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9e. Cela ne signifie pas cependant que la valeur de l\u2019adjudication a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[29] La v\u00e9ritable question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la valeur est le recouvrement. Le droit du plaignant de recouvrer une valeur unitaire particuli\u00e8re, et un droit financier particulier, n\u2019est pas acquis tant que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. Je pense que c\u2019est la date de prise d\u2019effet. L\u2019id\u00e9e qui sous\u2011tend le tarif est d\u2019\u00e9tablir la valeur des services obtenus dans le pass\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 les d\u00e9pens sont dus. Cette valeur doit \u00eatre tax\u00e9e selon la norme qui existe le jour o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision est sign\u00e9e.\n[30] Il existe un autre probl\u00e8me. Je ne vois pas comment une personne qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une taxation peut faire une partie de la taxation suivant une valeur unitaire et l\u2019achever suivant une autre valeur. S\u2019il y a dans cela un certain \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019heureux hasard qui doit profiter \u00e0 une partie ou \u00e0 l\u2019autre, je pense que c\u2019est le plaignant qui doit en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u00e9j\u00e0 du principe de l\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9. J\u2019ai par cons\u00e9quent r\u00e9ajust\u00e9 les chiffres suivant le tarif B pour refl\u00e9ter une valeur unitaire de 120 $.\n[31] Le tarif donne \u00e0 la personne qui taxe les d\u00e9pens un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour \u00e9tablir le nombre d\u2019unit\u00e9s qui devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 pour chaque service. L\u2019officier taxateur peut, par exemple, accorder de 3 \u00e0 7 unit\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9paration et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate contest\u00e9e. Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019il y avait quatre questions distinctes, toutes d\u00e9battues s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9crites de fa\u00e7on pratique comme des requ\u00eates contest\u00e9es. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, j\u2019ai par cons\u00e9quent accord\u00e9 de 3 \u00e0 5 unit\u00e9s pour chacune de ces questions.\n[32] L\u2019agent du greffe a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un tableau, \u00e0 mesure que nous proc\u00e9dions \u00e0 la taxation, contenant une liste des unit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es pour chaque service. Apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 la taxation des honoraires, une proc\u00e9dure similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie pour les d\u00e9bours. Il y a \u00e0 l\u2019article 400 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une liste de facteurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, qui peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte lors de la taxation. Ces sortes de facteurs interviennent naturellement lors de l\u2019exercice.\n(i) Choix de l\u2019avocat [33] Les principales questions soulev\u00e9es au cours de la taxation m\u00e9ritent d\u2019autres observations. La premi\u00e8re est que le plaignant a engag\u00e9 un avocat \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019Halifax. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que tous les frais qui d\u00e9coulent de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du choix de l\u2019avocat devraient \u00eatre support\u00e9s par le plaignant.\n[34] La question est plus compliqu\u00e9e qu\u2019elle semble l\u2019\u00eatre. Comme il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission \u00e9tait \u00e0 Toronto. M. Bagambiire a au d\u00e9part \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il se trouvait dans la m\u00eame ville. Il y a eu de longues discussions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9tails du dossier. En raison de ces discussions, M. Bagambiire \u00e9tait le choix logique au moment de choisir un avocat pour l\u2019audience.\n[35] Cependant, il y a d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui interviennent. M. Bagambiire vient de la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Halifax. Il est connu comme un d\u00e9fenseur des droits dans la collectivit\u00e9 noire et il a une expertise particuli\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Il est \u00e9vident que M. Brooks ressent un poids plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de discrimination, qui va au\u2011del\u00e0 des limites de la plainte actuelle. La preuve dont je dispose donnait \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il y a eu une rupture am\u00e8re entre la collectivit\u00e9 noire et la collectivit\u00e9 blanche dans la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Halifax.\n[36] Je ne veux pas sugg\u00e9rer que les membres des minorit\u00e9s ont le droit d\u2019une fa\u00e7on automatique de choisir des avocats qui font partie de leur propre collectivit\u00e9. Je pense n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019un de ces domaines dans lesquels des consid\u00e9rations exceptionnelles peuvent s\u2019appliquer au processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. M. Brooks a eu des probl\u00e8mes psychologiques dans le pass\u00e9. Je pense qu\u2019il trouvait un r\u00e9confort l\u00e9gitime du fait que son avocat principal pouvait le repr\u00e9senter en ayant toute la perspective et toute la connaissance r\u00e9sultant de sa vie en tant que membre de la m\u00eame minorit\u00e9.\n(ii) Avocat adjoint [37] La cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue vigoureusement par les deux parties. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait deux avocats qui \u00e9taient assist\u00e9s des repr\u00e9sentants et des agents du minist\u00e8re. Dans les circonstances, je pense que M. Brooks avait droit \u00e0 un deuxi\u00e8me avocat. Je ne vois pas pourquoi il avait besoin d\u2019un autre avocat de Toronto. J\u2019ai par cons\u00e9quent accept\u00e9 les frais pour les services d\u2019un avocat adjoint, mais j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 les d\u00e9bours se rapportant \u00e0 ses frais de voyages.\n(iii) Services avant le renvoi [38] Je dois dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 rapporte erron\u00e9ment la situation lorsqu\u2019il affirme, dans ses observations \u00e9crites, que j\u2019ai [Traduction] tax\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens pour l\u2019avocat du plaignant quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la plainte devant la Commission. L\u2019avocat r\u00e9f\u00e8re peut-\u00eatre au fait que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 un certain recouvrement pour les services que M. Bagambiire a fournis lors d\u2019une m\u00e9diation \u00e0 Halifax. Cependant, c\u2019\u00e9tait une m\u00e9diation tenue par le Tribunal apr\u00e8s que l\u2019affaire eut \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e et cette \u00e9tape devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une partie du processus de l\u2019instruction.\n[39] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 son propre processus. Toute adjudication de d\u00e9pens devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux frais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s pour la poursuite de l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal. Les frais que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9s sont des frais de base pour les services rendus par les avocats du plaignant au cours du processus de l\u2019audience. Les tableaux joints \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente parlent d\u2019eux\u2011m\u00eames.\n[40] Il n\u2019est pas possible de limiter l\u2019affaire de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise. Le plaignant a en outre droit \u00e0 certains d\u00e9pens, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que certains des services qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis avant que l\u2019affaire soit renvoy\u00e9e peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme des services faisant partie de fa\u00e7on naturelle et in\u00e9vitable du processus du Tribunal. J\u2019ai accept\u00e9 par cons\u00e9quent certains d\u00e9bours pour les services rendus devant la Commission. J\u2019en ai \u00e9galement tenu compte lorsque j\u2019ai effectu\u00e9 les ajustements d\u00e9finitifs pour le calcul global.\n[41] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet qu\u2019un plaignant a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour la consultation d\u2019un avocat et pour avoir entrepris les discussions aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, m\u00eame si des d\u00e9pens n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adjug\u00e9s. Cela a toutefois des limites. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il y a eu un dialogue long et approfondi entre l\u2019avocat du plaignant et la Commission. Cette sorte de service va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 des sortes de d\u00e9pens qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n(iv) Requ\u00eate inutile [42] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a en outre adopt\u00e9 la position selon laquelle une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 clarifier la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait inutile. Bien que je sois principalement d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question, je pense que le plaignant avait le droit de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un certain montant pour la requ\u00eate. J\u2019ai par cons\u00e9quent accord\u00e9 le nombre minimal d\u2019unit\u00e9s pour la requ\u00eate.\n(v) TPS [43] Le total des honoraires s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 70 800 $. Il y avait un litige quant \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant avait le droit de recouvrer la TPS payable sur les honoraires et d\u00e9bours. J\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette taxe constitue des frais in\u00e9vitables, de la nature des d\u00e9bours, et qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre support\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette taxe ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour r\u00e9duire artificiellement le recouvrement du plaignant qui est bien en de\u00e7\u00e0 de ses frais r\u00e9els.\n(vi) Total [44] Le tableau pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019agent quant aux d\u00e9pens tax\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire est joint \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente. Le total des d\u00e9pens tax\u00e9s, incluant la TPS, s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 75 756 $.\n(vii) D\u00e9bours [45] Les parties ont ensuite examin\u00e9 la liste des d\u00e9bours du plaignant, article par article, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re assez semblable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des observations selon lesquelles les d\u00e9bours \u00e9taient excessifs. Il y a aussi eu des observations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacun des articles.\n[46] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 la plupart des d\u00e9bours li\u00e9s aux services fournis avant que la plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e. Il y avait des exceptions. L\u2019article principal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait une r\u00e9clamation plut\u00f4t g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Frais de photocopies, de t\u00e9l\u00e9copies, de messagers, de consultation QL et d\u00e9penses vari\u00e9es, de 2001 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour : 13 643,62 $.\n[47] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 9 000 $ pour cet article. Cela permet un certain recouvrement des frais engag\u00e9s devant la Commission.\n[48] Il y avait \u00e9galement un litige \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des rapports des deux experts. Le premier \u00e9tait un rapport actuariel. Ce rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins de r\u00e8glement, avant le renvoi. Je ne pense pas qu\u2019il serait \u00e9quitable de demander \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de supporter les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce rapport \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire aux fins de l\u2019audience.\n[49] Il y avait un deuxi\u00e8me rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par M. Henry, un expert en relations interraciales. Le plaignant avait le droit de se procurer, en le payant, un tel rapport sur lequel on s\u2019appuie fr\u00e9quemment dans des cas de discrimination. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un rapport d\u2019expert appropri\u00e9 et que ce rapport avait par cons\u00e9quent \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 irrecevable. Cette pr\u00e9tention est en partie bien fond\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des deux parties, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 1 800 $ pour la pr\u00e9paration de ce rapport, ce qui constitue une r\u00e9duction de 1 000 $.\n[50] Le plaignant a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une somme de 8 997,63 $ pour la transcription de la partie de l\u2019audience qui traitait de la responsabilit\u00e9. M. Bagambiire a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019audience avait eu lieu au cours d\u2019une longue p\u00e9riode. Il avait par cons\u00e9quent besoin de la transcription pour pr\u00e9parer ses observations finales. J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 5 350 $, incluant la TPS.\n[51] M. Bagambiire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de fournir un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des appels interurbains. J\u2019ai par cons\u00e9quent accord\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de frais additionnels, sans re\u00e7us, une somme de 300 $.\n[52] Les d\u00e9bours r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par M. Bagambiire sont inclus dans son m\u00e9moire de frais initial. Le total des d\u00e9bours tax\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 22 590 $. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la TPS \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 incluse dans les d\u00e9bours individuels, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019ajustement pour la TPS. Le tableau pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019agent quant aux d\u00e9bours tax\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire est joint \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente.\n(viii) Total des honoraires, de la TPS et des d\u00e9bours [53] Le total des honoraires, de la TPS et des d\u00e9bours tax\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 98 346 $.\nIV. Ajustements d\u00e9finitifs [54] Les parties ont convenu que le Tribunal devrait faire des ajustements d\u00e9finitifs, apr\u00e8s que les frais accept\u00e9s suivant le tarif ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal [Traduction] ne doit pas entraver son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en renvoyant simplement au montant calcul\u00e9 suivant le tarif. L\u2019officier taxateur a un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et il doit l\u2019exercer.\n[55] J\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 certaines des pr\u00e9tentions du plaignant. M. Bagambiire a all\u00e9gu\u00e9, par exemple, que les d\u00e9pens devraient \u00eatre augment\u00e9s pour refl\u00e9ter le fait que le tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne correspond plus au co\u00fbt r\u00e9el des services juridiques offerts. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte courante, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les tarifs, qui doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e devant une autre tribune.\n[56] M. Bagambiire a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que de nombreux services qu\u2019il a rendus ne sont pas compris dans le tarif. Ma r\u00e9ponse est que M. Brooks a de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale droit \u00e0 ses frais pour l\u2019instruction. Ces frais sont compris dans le tarif. Si M. Brooks veut obtenir des services additionnels, il peut le faire. Il ne peut toutefois pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 paie pour ces services.\n[57] J\u2019irais plus loin. Si le plaignant voulait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des frais additionnels, je pense qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de les justifier article par article. L\u2019article 27 du tarif B permet qu\u2019une partie r\u00e9clame des d\u00e9pens pour d\u2019autres services accept\u00e9s aux fins de la taxation par l\u2019officier taxateur ou ordonn\u00e9s par la Cour. Cela ne l\u2019emp\u00eache pas de demander une augmentation plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale si le dossier requiert une charge inhabituelle de travail.\nA. Les facteurs pr\u00e9vus par la loi [58] La liste des facteurs pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 400(3) des R\u00e8gles passe au premier plan lors des ajustements d\u00e9finitifs.\n(i) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)a) des R\u00e8gles - R\u00e9sultat [59] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)a) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut tenir compte du r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instance. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que M. Brooks n\u2019a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une des trois all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal. Il n\u2019a pas obtenu un emploi. Il n\u2019a pas obtenu la sorte de compensation qu\u2019il tentait d\u2019obtenir. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu un gain de cause important.\n[60] M. Bagambiire voyait l\u2019affaire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Brooks tentait d\u2019obtenir une conclusion selon laquelle il avait fait l\u2019objet de discrimination. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il a eu [Traduction] totalement gain de cause. Il y a des choses \u00e0 dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux points de vue. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la voie du centre. M. Brooks a eu gain de cause, mais le r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait mixte.\n[61] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comportent une bonne part d\u2019information r\u00e9trospective. Bien qu\u2019il soit possible d\u2019en d\u00e9battre, je pense que les deux parties avaient le droit de contester toutes les questions qui m\u2019\u00e9taient soumises. La question qui est soulev\u00e9e lors de l\u2019examen du r\u00e9sultat du litige est celle de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour le plaignant de poursuivre la cause, non celle de savoir s\u2019il a eu gain de cause.\n[62] En fin de compte, le fait le plus important dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte est la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Brooks. La port\u00e9e de ce r\u00e9sultat ne devrait pas \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e. Le plaignant a \u00e9tabli que le concours tenu en 1992 \u00e9tait manifestement in\u00e9quitable.\n(ii) Alin\u00e9a 400(3)b) des R\u00e8gles- Quantum [63] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)b) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut prendre en compte les sommes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es et les sommes recouvr\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu\u2019il y avait une disparit\u00e9 entre l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la r\u00e9clamation et le montant recouvr\u00e9.\n[64] La pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard comporte deux aspects. Je ne peux pas accepter la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral. La nature modeste de l\u2019indemnisation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des limites pr\u00e9vues par la loi. Je pense qu\u2019il est clair que, sans la limite pr\u00e9vue par la loi, M. Brooks aurait obtenu une indemnisation beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n[65] Toutefois, la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est bien fond\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9clamation pour perte de revenu. Il est clair que M. Brooks tentait d\u2019obtenir des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats importants pour perte de revenu. Il n\u2019en a pas obtenu. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur quant aux d\u00e9pens.\n(iii) Alin\u00e9a 400(3)c) des R\u00e8gles- Importance et complexit\u00e9 [66] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)c) des R\u00e8gles mentionne l\u2019importance et la complexit\u00e9 des questions en litige. Je dois dire, tr\u00e8s candidement, qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis les avocats ont compliqu\u00e9 les faits plus qu\u2019ils devaient l\u2019\u00eatre. Je parle en particulier du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[67] D\u2019un point de vue l\u00e9gal, l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement complexe. Elle soulevait n\u00e9anmoins certaines questions difficiles quant \u00e0 leur valeur probante qui exigeaient un examen attentif du droit. Il y avait de nombreuses questions accessoires. Mon point de vue personnel est que l\u2019importance de l\u2019affaire repose sur le poids qui doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 aux perceptions des divers t\u00e9moins.\n[68] Les questions soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens sont \u00e9galement importantes. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un nouveau domaine.\n(iv) Alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles - Toute offre \u00e9crite de r\u00e8glement [69] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut tenir compte de toute offre \u00e9crite de r\u00e8glement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en vertu de cet ali\u00e9na deux lettres qui ont re\u00e7u une cote \u00e0 des fins d\u2019identification. Ces lettres contiennent des offres de r\u00e8glement de la plainte pour une somme plus importante que celle que le plaignant a re\u00e7ue \u00e0 la suite du processus devant le Tribunal.\n[70] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles mentionne toute offre \u00e9crite de r\u00e8glement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne le mot toute. Il peut y avoir ici une diff\u00e9rence d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Je ne pense pas, personnellement, que le mot toute, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles, ait eu \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit comme objet de supplanter la common law \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des communications faites sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits.\n[71] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a de plus soumis \u00e0 mon attention l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Apotex Inc. c. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Ltd., [2001] A.C.F. no 727. Cet arr\u00eat \u00e9tablit simplement qu\u2019une offre \u00e9crite ne peut pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle contienne une offre claire et sans \u00e9quivoque. Une offre assortie de conditions ne respecte pas les exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles.\na) La loi exige un avis [72] La jurisprudence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e9tablit qu\u2019une offre de r\u00e8glement faite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits n\u2019est admissible lors de la taxation des d\u00e9pens que si la partie qui fait l\u2019offre a donn\u00e9 un avis selon lequel elle a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter l\u2019offre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens. Orkin adopte la m\u00eame position. La d\u00e9cision faisant autorit\u00e9 au Canada semble \u00eatre la d\u00e9cision Graham c. Dillon (1986), 5 B.C.L.R. (2d) 218 (C.S.C.\u2011B).\n[73] Il est important d\u2019\u00eatre clair quant \u00e0 la terminologie. Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite du sens de l\u2019expression [Traduction] sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits.\n[Traduction] L\u2019expression [sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits] am\u00e8ne l\u2019id\u00e9e que la partie qui \u00e9crit la lettre le fait sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits quant \u00e0 sa position dans le litige, et en particulier, sans admission qui pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e contre elle pour \u00e9tablir une responsabilit\u00e9.\nJe pense que ce sens est trop restrictif.\n[74] Le concept de l\u2019expression sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits signifie simplement qu\u2019une partie qui pr\u00e9pare un document l\u2019a fourni, \u00e0 des fins de r\u00e8glement, en comprenant qu\u2019il ne sera pas utilis\u00e9 contre elle. Une partie peut pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019un document est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits \u00e0 une fin et sans r\u00e9serve \u00e0 une autre fin. Une lettre peut \u00eatre \u00e9crite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du fond de la question de la responsabilit\u00e9, par exemple, et sans r\u00e9serve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du redressement ou des d\u00e9pens.\n[75] Il existe deux principes juridiques contradictoires qui interviennent dans ce contexte. Le premier est que les parties devraient avoir la libert\u00e9 de n\u00e9gocier un r\u00e8glement, sans craindre que leurs n\u00e9gociations soient utilis\u00e9es contre elles. Le deuxi\u00e8me est qu\u2019une partie qui rejette une offre raisonnable n\u2019a pas le droit de recouvrer tous les d\u00e9pens du litige. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que ce dernier principe est l\u2019une des [Traduction] consid\u00e9rations principales lors de la taxation des d\u00e9pens.\n[76] Cependant, c\u2019est le premier principe qui est le principe principal. Le deuxi\u00e8me principe permet simplement \u00e0 une partie de placer des limites \u00e0 la nature du document fait sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits. C\u2019est en fin de compte une question de renonciation. Une partie qui a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter ces sortes de documents, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens, doit envoyer \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie un message clair \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019elle renonce aux protections offertes aux documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens seulement. La renonciation doit \u00eatre expresse.\n[77] Il est erron\u00e9 de penser que la loi permet la pr\u00e9sentation en preuve d\u2019une offre faite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle soit faite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits. Il y a simplement diff\u00e9rents cas. Les sortes d\u2019offres qui sont envisag\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence sont sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits de la position prise par la partie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question principale. Cela ne les emp\u00eache pas d\u2019\u00eatre sans r\u00e9serve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens.\nb) La premi\u00e8re offre [78] La premi\u00e8re lettre peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on sommaire. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le plaignant lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles vise une offre compl\u00e8te. L\u2019arr\u00eat Apotex appuierait une telle position.\n[79] La premi\u00e8re lettre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne respecte pas cette exigence. Elle renvoie \u00e0 d\u2019autres communications et elle est peu concluante. Elle ne respecte pas non plus les exigences de l\u2019avis. La lettre est irrecevable.\nc) La deuxi\u00e8me offre [80] La deuxi\u00e8me lettre soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations plus graves. Elle contient une offre formelle, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[Traduction]\nSans admettre quelque responsabilit\u00e9 que ce soit, notre client offre par la pr\u00e9sente de r\u00e9gler cette affaire pour une somme de 125 000 $, comprenant tout.\n[81] Cela peut \u00eatre un exc\u00e8s de rh\u00e9torique. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la somme au plaignant, mais il n\u2019admet aucune responsabilit\u00e9 que ce soit. Cette affirmation ne peut se limiter au litige. Elle s\u2019applique au redressement et aux d\u00e9pens, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la question de fond de la responsabilit\u00e9.\n[82] La deuxi\u00e8me offre ne se qualifie pas comme une offre de r\u00e8glement au sens de l\u2019article 400 des R\u00e8gles. C\u2019est une chose pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 de dire que la lettre est \u00e9crite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits quant \u00e0 [Traduction] sa position dans le litige et une autre chose de dire qu\u2019elle est simplement sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits. Cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019existe pas, aux fins du litige.\n[83] Je ne vois pas comment une d\u00e9claration faite sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits que ce soit respecte l\u2019exigence de l\u2019article 400 des R\u00e8gles. La mention de toute offre \u00e9crite dans l\u2019article concerne les offres \u00e9crites faites sans r\u00e9serve, du moins \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens. Il est facile d\u2019oublier l\u2019aspect de l\u2019article selon lequel un document \u00e9crit sans r\u00e9serve n\u2019est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la loi. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a le droit de pr\u00e9senter l\u2019offre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des d\u00e9pens, ce n\u2019est que parce que l\u2019autre partie a le droit de le pr\u00e9senter en preuve.\n[84] Je pense que c\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur. Il se peut qu\u2019il soit \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter la deuxi\u00e8me lettre dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances. Mais l\u2019affaire aurait pu prendre une autre direction. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait le plaignant qui avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de pr\u00e9senter la lettre en preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait sans doute eu le droit de s\u2019y opposer, en invoquant que la lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite [Traduction] sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits que ce soit.\n[85] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut pas pr\u00e9tendre deux choses contraires. Il a renonc\u00e9 aux protections offertes aux documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits ou il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Je pense qu\u2019il est clair que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne l\u2019a pas fait. La deuxi\u00e8me lettre est par cons\u00e9quent irrecevable. Il s\u2019ensuit que je ne dispose pas de preuve d\u2019une offre de r\u00e8glement dont je pourrais tenir compte suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)e) des R\u00e8gles.\n1. Le plaignant avait le droit de rejeter la deuxi\u00e8me offre\n[86] Je dois ajouter, m\u00eame si ce n\u2019est que par souci de clart\u00e9, que je ne partage pas la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle le plaignant aurait d\u00fb accepter la deuxi\u00e8me offre. Il ne m\u2019appartient pas de me prononcer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[87] Cependant, il y a un point de principe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont fondamentaux. Une conclusion selon laquelle ces droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreints a une valeur symbolique qui s\u2019\u00e9tend au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re que peut obtenir un plaignant qui a gain de cause. On ne peut pas dire, sans une admission de responsabilit\u00e9, que M. Brooks a obtenu moins par le litige qu\u2019il aurait obtenu en acceptant le r\u00e8glement.\n[88] Un litige en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne a ses aspects priv\u00e9s. Ce n\u2019est toutefois pas un litige priv\u00e9. Il y a, dans le processus, d\u2019autres aspects dont il faut traiter en plus de l\u2019indemnisation. Un intim\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00e9chapper \u00e0 une conclusion selon laquelle il y a eu de la discrimination, et aux d\u00e9pens r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une telle conclusion, simplement en offrant \u00e0 un plaignant le montant maximal d\u2019indemnisation pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n(v) Alin\u00e9a 400(3)g) des R\u00e8gles - Charge de travail [89] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)g) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut tenir compte de la charge de travail. M. Bagambiire affirme que le travail dans le dossier \u00e9tait inhabituellement lourd, en raison de la complexit\u00e9 des dossiers d\u2019emploi. Il attribue une certaine partie du travail \u00e0 l\u2019omission de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019avoir communiqu\u00e9 tous les dossiers pertinents.\n[90] Toutefois, cela joue dans les deux sens \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les avocats du plaignant ont fait plus que ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019examen des dossiers d\u2019emploi.\n[91] L\u2019intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant a agi d\u2019une fa\u00e7on exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment litigieuse. Bien que j\u2019aie des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 l\u2019attitude adopt\u00e9e par les avocats, les parties pouvaient revendiquer leurs droits. Le litige est un jeu \u00e9puisant et le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019est pas conscient des efforts qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour rendre une plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[92] Je n\u2019accepte pas la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle la pr\u00e9sente affaire a exig\u00e9 des efforts extraordinaires de la part des avocats de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties. J\u2019accepte n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il y a eu une bonne quantit\u00e9 de travail pour mettre de l\u2019ordre dans les faits. Une certaine portion de ce travail peut \u00eatre attribuable au long d\u00e9lai pour instruire l\u2019affaire.\n(vi) Alin\u00e9a 400(3)h) des R\u00e8gles - Int\u00e9r\u00eat public [93] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 400(3)h) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut tenir compte du fait que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la r\u00e9solution judiciaire de l\u2019instance justifie une adjudication particuli\u00e8re des d\u00e9pens. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un domaine pour lequel des consid\u00e9rations sp\u00e9ciales s\u2019appliquent dans le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\n[94] Je dis cela parce que le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ne constitue pas un litige priv\u00e9. Il a un caract\u00e8re plus fondamental. La meilleure analogie dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est probablement l\u2019analogie avec un d\u00e9lit constitutionnel : le redressement peut \u00eatre un redressement priv\u00e9, mais la cause de l\u2019action a son origine dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public plus large. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans le processus est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment primordial, m\u00eame dans un cas dans lequel la plainte concerne un litige entre des parties priv\u00e9es.\na) Audiences servant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public [95] Le point dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte est que les audiences servent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour rendre public le probl\u00e8me de la discrimination et le soumettre \u00e0 l\u2019examen public. La politique publique ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e dans les lois en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne accorde une valeur r\u00e9elle au fait qu\u2019une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue. C\u2019est d\u2019autant plus vrai lorsque la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[96] Le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne a des buts plus larges que le processus judiciaire habituel. Ces buts incluent l\u2019\u00e9ducation et le redressement symbolique des griefs sociaux ou historiques. Je pense que des audiences donnent \u00e9galement \u00e0 des individus la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exprimer leurs frustrations et leurs d\u00e9ceptions quant \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice et \u00e0 la discrimination. Ces aspects d\u2019une audience sont difficiles \u00e0 \u00e9valuer et ne se traduisent pas en termes financiers stricts.\n[97] Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte et la tenue d\u2019une instruction fournissent un processus par lequel la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termine ce qui est appropri\u00e9 et correct, dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi. Le public b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un litige qui aide \u00e0 \u00e9laborer l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e8gles de droit et des principes qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9gler les conflits sociaux. Cela sert \u00e0 promouvoir la justice et contribue \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commun.\n[98] M\u00eame si la pr\u00e9sente affaire traitait d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par une partie priv\u00e9e, elle traitait de questions qui d\u00e9passaient largement les param\u00e8tres stricts de la plainte. Je crois que la plainte de M. Brooks avait, dans le contexte de sa collectivit\u00e9, une certaine signification historique. Ce facteur doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 en sa faveur, dans le calcul final des d\u00e9pens.\n(vii) Sous alin\u00e9a 400(3)k) des R\u00e8gles - Mesure inutile [99] Le sous-alin\u00e9a 400(3)k)(i) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que la Cour peut tenir compte de la question de savoir si une mesure prise au cours de l\u2019instance \u00e9tait inutile. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que je partage d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la demande de clarification de ma d\u00e9cision, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, \u00e9tait inutile. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur significatif dans les ajustements d\u00e9finitifs. Il existe une question plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019attitude affich\u00e9e du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du plaignant, attitude qui \u00e9tait ent\u00eat\u00e9e et belliqueuse. Cette attitude a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e et aux difficult\u00e9s de l\u2019audience.\nB. Autres facteurs [100] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les facteurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Certains de ces facteurs militent pour une augmentation des d\u00e9pens d\u00e9finitifs, certains pour une r\u00e9duction. Cependant, la principale consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9cider des chiffres d\u00e9finitifs est la conclusion selon laquelle M. Brooks a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination. \u00c0 mon avis, c\u2019est tout ce que, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste, il pouvait obtenir.\n[101] Le concours qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la conclusion selon laquelle il y a eu de la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu en 1992. Il a fallu beaucoup de temps avant que la situation se r\u00e8gle. M. Brooks a apparemment c\u00e9d\u00e9 sous la pression au cours du processus. Ce fait aide \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte avant le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1997.\n[102] Il y a eu d\u2019autres d\u00e9lais devant la Commission. La plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal avant le mois de juillet 2003. Nous sommes maintenant en 2005. Il ne sert \u00e0 rien de rejeter la responsabilit\u00e9 sur quelqu\u2019un. Le temps s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9coul\u00e9 quand M. Brooks a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte tardivement. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal \u00e0 une \u00e9tape si tardive qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de rectifier les probl\u00e8mes dans le processus.\n[103] Rien ne peut \u00eatre fait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 en 1992. La v\u00e9ritable solution \u00e9tait de tenir un autre concours. Cela aurait eu des cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles pour les participants au processus. Les candidats qui avaient r\u00e9ussi le concours auraient perdu leur poste. Il semble clair que Lisa Howe aurait obtenu un des postes. Elle n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 attendre pendant quatorze ans pour obtenir un poste permanent. M. Brooks aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 \u00e0 un rang plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur la liste d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\n[104] Il y aurait eu d\u2019autres avantages \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la politique. L\u2019\u00e9ducation est l\u2019un des objectifs du processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Une d\u00e9cision de tenir un nouveau concours, sous l\u2019\u0153il vigilant de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, aurait \u00e9veill\u00e9 l\u2019attention des gestionnaires et du personnel sur les questions en litige dans le domaine. Cela aurait in\u00e9vitablement eu un effet d\u2019entra\u00eenement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019embauche et des pratiques d\u2019emploi du minist\u00e8re.\n[105] Tous ces avantages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus. Le Tribunal ne peut pas ordonner un nouveau concours treize ans apr\u00e8s la tenue du concours original. Les aspects pratiques de la situation ne permettent pas de le faire. Il existe des questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui emp\u00eachent de le faire. Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne au litige. Ma compr\u00e9hension de la situation actuelle est que M. Brooks a le sentiment que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019en est tir\u00e9 \u00e0 bon compte. Il y a beaucoup de choses \u00e0 dire quant \u00e0 ce point de vue.\n[106] On peut reprocher \u00e0 M. Brooks d\u2019avoir exag\u00e9r\u00e9 ses possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9ussir un concours \u00e9quitable. J\u2019ai \u00e9tabli clairement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de raisons de croire qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9ussi un deuxi\u00e8me concours. Cela dit, je pense que ses sentiments sont justifi\u00e9s. Ils m\u00e9ritent d\u2019\u00eatre exprim\u00e9s. Tout le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 manipul\u00e9 par M. Savoury. Les candidats qui ont r\u00e9ussi le concours n\u2019avaient pas droit aux postes obtenus.\n[107] Il est trop tard pour ordonner un nouveau concours. La question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens est celle de savoir si M. Brooks avait raison de poursuivre le litige si longtemps apr\u00e8s qu\u2019est survenu l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, alors que le redressement naturel dans l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible. Je pense que la r\u00e9ponse doit \u00eatre affirmative. La seule correction qui \u00e9tait possible, selon moi, \u00e9tait une conclusion de droit selon laquelle le concours \u00e9tait in\u00e9quitable. Cela corrige au moins le dossier public et \u00e9tablit ce qui \u00e9tait correct.\n[108] Un des objectifs du processus adjudicatif est de d\u00e9clarer les droits des parties. Cette d\u00e9claration des droits sert un objectif important, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019elle est faite longtemps apr\u00e8s qu\u2019est survenu l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 des redressements plus concrets ne sont plus disponibles. Je pense que l\u2019importance de cet exercice, dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, est suffisante pour justifier le litige. Cette importance devrait \u00eatre refl\u00e9t\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9pens.\n[109] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, rien n\u2019est parfait. Je pense que la position adopt\u00e9e par le plaignant comporte un aspect obstin\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que M. Brooks n\u2019\u00e9tait pas content de la d\u00e9cision que j\u2019ai rendue dans l\u2019affaire et, \u00e0 mon avis, les parties ont adopt\u00e9 une attitude d\u2019opposition. Ce fait \u00e9tait \u00e9vident dans la contestation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens et dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre les avocats. Il y a encore des instances devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui concernent apparemment les aspects plus syst\u00e9miques de l\u2019affaire.\n[110] On a dit qu\u2019il y a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment th\u00e9rapeutique dans le processus de l\u2019instruction, qui le distingue du processus devant les tribunaux civils. Cela a un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans le r\u00e9tablissement de la dignit\u00e9 des deux parties et dans la promotion de relations harmonieuses entre les employeurs et leurs employ\u00e9s. J\u2019ai le regret de dire que dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire je ne vois aucune r\u00e9conciliation qui serait souhaitable dans un tel processus.\nV. D\u00e9cision [111] Je pense que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 une augmentation du montant total. Les d\u00e9pens tax\u00e9s, comprenant tout, seront \u00e9tablis \u00e0 cent cinq mille dollars (105 000 $). Cette augmentation du total refl\u00e8te une augmentation dans les honoraires. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une augmentation modeste, conforme avec l\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui caract\u00e9rise le processus de taxation. Il n\u2019y a pas de motifs justifiant l\u2019augmentation ou la r\u00e9duction des d\u00e9bours.\n[112] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que le Tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une taxation, et que la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je pense que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 un certain temps pour examiner ses choix quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Les d\u00e9pens sont par cons\u00e9quent payables dans les soixante jours de la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[113] Il y a un point accessoire. La pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 accorder de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat simple sur les indemnit\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. De l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat simple sera par cons\u00e9quent payable sur le montant total des d\u00e9pens. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat sera calcul\u00e9 annuellement \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalent au taux bancaire (s\u00e9ries mensuelles) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat courra \u00e0 compter du jour suivant l\u2019\u00e9coulement des soixante jours. Je demeure saisi de l\u2019affaire pendant deux semaines pour traiter de toute question en instance.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDr Paul Groarke Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 12 juillet 2005\nTableau A \u2013 Frais du tarif b des r\u00e8gles de la cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\nUnit\u00e9s\nA. introductifs d\u2019instance et autres actes de proc\u00e9dure\n1.

UN MANDATAIRE N'A PAS UN STATUT IND\u00c9PENDANT\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e9nonce que le Tribunal donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. La d\u00e9cision faisant l'objet des pr\u00e9sentes traite de la question de savoir si un profane peut compara\u00eetre \u00e0 titre d'avocat au nom du plaignant.\n[2] Mme Rubio compara\u00eet au nom du plaignant. Elle n'est pas avocate. Elle a une certaine formation en tant que technicienne juridique et elle a apparemment comparu devant des tribunaux en mati\u00e8re criminelle, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment lors d'affaires se rapportant \u00e0 des d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 par proc\u00e9dure sommaire. Mme Rubio parle couramment espagnol, la langue maternelle du plaignant. Mme Rubio a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le plaignant durant toute la dur\u00e9e de sa plainte.\n[3] Je veux \u00eatre clair. La question n'est pas celle de savoir si Mme Rubio peut compara\u00eetre au nom du plaignant. La question est celle de savoir si elle peut compara\u00eetre en tant qu'avocate. L'intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal, par \u00e9crit et de fa\u00e7on officielle, qu'elle ne prend pas position \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette question. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de s'opposer \u00e0 la comparution de Mme Rubio. La question est par cons\u00e9quent th\u00e9orique.\n[4] Le probl\u00e8me est que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question qui m'est soumise peut avoir une influence sur d'autres questions soulev\u00e9es au cours de l'audience. Il est par cons\u00e9quent n\u00e9cessaire de traiter de cette question.\nII. LE SENS DU MOT AVOCAT [5] Ma compr\u00e9hension du mot avocat dans un contexte juridique a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 que ce mot renvoie \u00e0 une personne inscrite au barreau. Il s'agit certainement de l'utilisation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aupr\u00e8s des tribunaux. Le mot peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9, par analogie, pour renvoyer \u00e0 une personne qui fournit les m\u00eames services que fournit un avocat. Il s'agit toutefois de l'emploi descriptif du mot et non d'un emploi permissif.\n[6] La version fran\u00e7aise de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne confirme l'emploi anglais du mot. Le paragraphe 50(1) \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\nJe pense que le sens du mot avocat dans ce paragraphe est simple. Les parties peuvent pr\u00e9senter leurs causes en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat.\n[7] Je dis cela malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'on ait attir\u00e9 mon attention sur une autre d\u00e9finition du mot avocat contenue dans Le Robert Micro, une d\u00e9finition qui va plus loin. Cette d\u00e9finition ne fait que sugg\u00e9rer que le mot peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 au sens figur\u00e9, comme le mot anglais counsel, pour renvoyer \u00e0 une personne qui ex\u00e9cute les fonctions d'un avocat. On pourrait simplement dire tout aussi facilement que Mme Rubio a agi en tant qu'avocate de M. Filgueira dans ses relations avec la Commission. Il s'agit d'un emploi m\u00e9taphorique du mot. Cela ne fait pas d'elle une avocate. Cela ne lui donne pas le droit de compara\u00eetre dans des situations dans lesquelles la loi limite aux avocats le droit de compara\u00eetre.\n[8] Mme Rubio a pr\u00e9tendu que l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Olavarria c. Le ministre de la Main-d'uvre et de l'Immigration (1973), 41 D.L.R. (3d) 472 (C.A.F.), lui \u00e9tait favorable. Je ne peux pas partager son opinion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La Cour a statu\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Olavarria que le mot counsel de l'article 3 de la Loi sur l'immigration renvoyait \u00e0 un avocat. La version fran\u00e7aise de l'article 3 renvoyait \u00e0 un avocat.\n[9] La Cour a ensuite examin\u00e9 le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates de l'immigration, DORS\/67-621, dans lequel le mot \u00e9tait apparemment utilis\u00e9 dans un sens plus large. Le texte fran\u00e7ais du R\u00e8glement \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent de celui de la Loi et rendait le mot anglais counsel par un avocat ou autre conseiller. La Cour a \u00e9tendu le sens du mot anglais dans ce contexte en se fondant sur le fait que la version fran\u00e7aise du R\u00e8glement parlait \u00e0 la fois d'un avocat ou d'un autre conseiller. Il s'agit d'une question de respect du texte fran\u00e7ais.\n[10] L'arr\u00eat Olavarria soutient la proposition selon laquelle le sens du mot counsel peut \u00eatre \u00e9tendu aux situations dans lesquelles le texte fran\u00e7ais d\u00e9montre que le mot est utilis\u00e9 au sens figur\u00e9 pour renvoyer \u00e0 une personne qui fournit les services que fournit un avocat. Ce n'est pas la situation qui m'est soumise. Le texte fran\u00e7ais du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, comme la Loi sur l'immigration, renvoie \u00e0 un avocat. Comme la Cour d'appel l'a reconnu dans l'arr\u00eat Olavarria, l'emploi fran\u00e7ais renforce et en fait limite le sens ordinaire du mot anglais. Le mot counsel au paragraphe 50(1) renvoie \u00e0 un avocat.\nIII. LE DROIT D'\u00caTRE REPR\u00c9SENT\u00c9 PAR UN MANDATAIRE [11] Cela ne signifie pas que Mme Rubio ne peut compara\u00eetre au nom du plaignant. Il y a d'autres possibilit\u00e9s. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour divisionnaire dans l'affaire Re Men's Clothing Manufacturer's Association et al. and Arthurs et al. (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 20 (H.C.J.), reconna\u00eet qu'il existe en common law un droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un mandataire, droit qui est assez distinct de tout droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\n[12] L'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick Thomas c. Association des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers auxiliaires du Nouveau-Brunswick (2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 337, traite du droit se rapportant aux mandataires. Au paragraphe 25, M. le juge Robertson d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\nPour r\u00e9sumer, en common law, les personnes qui comparaissent devant des tribunaux d'arbitrage ont le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par un mandataire de leur choix.\nCe droit existe ind\u00e9pendamment de tout droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\n[13] Il existe plusieurs raisons justifiant qu'un mandataire comparaisse. Au paragraphe 21, la Cour d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\nUn profane intelligent peut \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9finir les questions en litige et de formuler des r\u00e9ponses plus facilement que la partie \u00e0 l'instance. Par contre, la pr\u00e9sence du mandataire peut avoir pour seul motif d'apporter un appui moral ou d'aider un mandant qui a un handicap physique ou mental. Dans de telles circonstances, la repr\u00e9sentation par un profane peut \u00eatre approuv\u00e9e. [...]\nJe pense que cette sorte de raisonnement s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 quelqu'un qui a des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s'exprimer dans les langues officielles du Tribunal.\n[14] La nature de l'affaire qui est soumise au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ajoute \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de ces sortes d'observations dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte. Il m'appara\u00eet qu'il y a des situations dans lesquelles le recours \u00e0 un mandataire est une partie in\u00e9vitable du processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Je pense \u00e0 des cas dans lesquels un plaignant a un \u00e9tat psychologique ou physique qui rend difficile ou peut-\u00eatre impossible une comparution sans l'assistance d'un mandataire.\n[15] Le Tribunal reste n\u00e9anmoins le ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure. Comme la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick le d\u00e9clare, dans l'arr\u00eat Thomas, au paragraphe 25 :\n[...] ce droit n'est pas absolu. Les tribunaux conservent le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel d'autoriser uniquement la participation des personnes qui, \u00e0 leur avis, faciliteront la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage au lieu de l'entraver.\nLa Cour fait remarquer dans un passage ant\u00e9rieur, au paragraphe 21, que la participation d'un profane dans des cas o\u00f9 les questions en litige sont complexes ne peut qu'embrouiller davantage les choses. Un tribunal conserve par cons\u00e9quent le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'interdire la participation d'un mandataire ou d'en limiter la port\u00e9e \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape de l'instance.\n[16] Je pense que tout cela aide \u00e0 expliquer la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui reconna\u00eet le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat. Suivant ce paragraphe, une partie a le droit de mener sa cause par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat. Un avocat qui est engag\u00e9 par une partie compara\u00eet de plein droit. Un mandataire compara\u00eet seulement apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 la comparution. Il existe des raisons \u00e9videntes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette r\u00e8gle.\n[17] \u00c0 mon avis, M. Filgueira a le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un mandataire. Il a n\u00e9anmoins une obligation de convaincre le Tribunal, si le Tribunal l'estime n\u00e9cessaire, que le mandataire qui le repr\u00e9sente est en mesure de faciliter le processus. Il n'existe pas de pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je suis convaincu que Mme Rubio devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 compara\u00eetre au nom de M. Filgueira. Elle a l'avantage de parler sa langue, elle a une certaine formation en droit et elle a une connaissance approfondie de l'affaire. Je pense qu'il est manifeste que sa comparution prot\u00e9gera l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, l'efficacit\u00e9 et l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l'audience.\nIV. UN MANDATAIRE N'A PAS UN STATUT IND\u00c9PENDANT [18] Je veux faire un dernier commentaire. Mme Rubio s'identifie comme une [TRADUCTION] repr\u00e9sentante. Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait \u00e0 l'aise quant aux cons\u00e9quences d'une telle d\u00e9claration. C'est une chose de dire que Mme Rubio repr\u00e9sente M. Filgueira, en tant que son mandataire, et une autre chose de dire qu'elle est une repr\u00e9sentante, comme si elle avait une certaine capacit\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante pour compara\u00eetre en son nom. Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9claration discutable : un mandataire compara\u00eet seulement en la capacit\u00e9 de la personne pour laquelle il agit.\n[19] Cela ne touche pas aux d\u00e9tails pratiques de la situation. Un mandataire s'exprime au nom du plaignant. Il a la capacit\u00e9 de transmettre ses souhaits au Tribunal, de poser des questions en son nom et de participer de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l'audience. Il n'a pas le statut professionnel ou l\u00e9gal d'un avocat et il n'a pas un statut ind\u00e9pendant pour compara\u00eetre devant un tribunal.\n[20] Il y a \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard des diff\u00e9rences fondamentales. Un avocat a une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte, qui est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de celle de son client. C'est ce qui lui donne le statut d'avocat. La port\u00e9e de cette distinction devra \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre moment.\nM.

L'intim\u00e9, Jim Pankiw, \u00e9tait membre du Parlement. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lu lors de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de 2004.\n[2] Alors qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9put\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'auteur d'une brochure nomm\u00e9e le bulletin parlementaire, une brochure qui \u00e9tait distribu\u00e9e aux \u00e9lecteurs de sa circonscription de Saskatoon-Humbolt. Le bulletin parlementaire est imprim\u00e9 et pay\u00e9 sous les auspices de la Chambre des communes. Chaque d\u00e9put\u00e9 a le droit d'envoyer jusqu'\u00e0 quatre bulletins parlementaires par ann\u00e9e.\n[3] Les plaignants all\u00e8guent qu'en octobre 2003 l'intim\u00e9 a fait distribuer un bulletin parlementaire qui contenait des commentaires discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit du peuple autochtone, contrevenant aux articles 5, 12 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) afin qu'une audience soit tenue.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance d\u00e9clarant que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence constitutionnelle pour entendre les plaintes.\nI. COMP\u00c9TENCE EXCLUSIVE DU BUREAU DE R\u00c9GIE INTERNE DE LA CHAMBRE DES COMMUNES A. La r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation des ressources de la Chambre [5] Les bulletins parlementaires sont imprim\u00e9s avec les ressources de la Chambre des communes. Les bulletins parlementaires sont financ\u00e9s par le Bureau de r\u00e9gie interne de la Chambre des communes. Le bureau est constitu\u00e9 suivant les articles 50 et suivants de la Loi sur le Parlement du Canada (LPC). Les membres du bureau incluent des d\u00e9put\u00e9s du parti gouvernemental et des d\u00e9put\u00e9s de l'opposition. La pr\u00e9sidence du bureau est assum\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident de la Chambre. Le bureau est charg\u00e9 des questions financi\u00e8res et administratives int\u00e9ressant la Chambre des communes, ses locaux, ses services et son personnel de m\u00eame que les d\u00e9put\u00e9s.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le bureau a comp\u00e9tence exclusive \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des bulletins parlementaires, notamment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du contenu de ces bulletins.\n[7] Suivant le paragraphe 52.6(1) de la LPC, le bureau a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour statuer sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation de fonds, de biens, de services ou de locaux mis \u00e0 la disposition des d\u00e9put\u00e9s dans le cadre de leurs fonctions parlementaires.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le maintien de liens avec les \u00e9lecteurs constitue l'une des fonctions parlementaires d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la publication d'un bulletin parlementaire permet aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s de mieux entretenir ces liens, ces communications doivent logiquement constituer \u00e9galement une fonction parlementaire.\n[9] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que si le bureau a comp\u00e9tence exclusive \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette fonction parlementaire, alors aucune cour ou aucun autre organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la loi, y compris le Tribunal, a comp\u00e9tence pour rendre des d\u00e9cisions sur la m\u00eame question. La pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est assez audacieuse. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 une fois de plus dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, au paragraphe 81, que la LCDP est un texte quasi constitutionnel et que toute exception \u00e0 son application doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement.\n[10] Y a-t-il une telle d\u00e9claration claire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la LPC? \u00c0 notre avis, il n'y en a pas. L'intim\u00e9 fonde sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du bureau sur le paragraphe 52.6(1) de la LPC qui \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\n[11] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, il n'y a pas de mention directe de la non-application de la LCDP ou de l'exclusion de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend, cependant, que la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du bureau \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation des ressources de la Chambre par un d\u00e9put\u00e9 englobe le contenu de tout document publi\u00e9 avec ces ressources. Il fonde cette pr\u00e9tention sur une interpr\u00e9tation de la version anglaise du paragraphe 52.6(1), dans lequel le terme proper est utilis\u00e9. Selon l'Oxford English Dictionary, le mot proper est d\u00e9fini comme [TRADUCTION] convenable, appropri\u00e9, correct, conform\u00e9ment aux demandes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u00e9cent, et respectable. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le bureau a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour d\u00e9cider si un bulletin parlementaire, notamment son contenu, a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les limites de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation dans le cadre parlementaire.\n[12] Le l\u00e9gislateur avait-il v\u00e9ritablement l'intention, par l'utilisation du mot proper, de doter le bureau d'une comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur le caract\u00e8re convenable, la d\u00e9cence, la conformit\u00e9 aux demandes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou le caract\u00e8re respectable des bulletins parlementaires? Une lecture de la version fran\u00e7aise du paragraphe 52.6(1) donne \u00e0 penser autrement. Le mot proper est rendu par r\u00e9gularit\u00e9. Le Nouveau Petit Robert d\u00e9finit le mot r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 comme conformit\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles, soit conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que ce terme est plus \u00e9troitement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 des notions de r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 administrative et nous sommes de cet avis. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation est compatible avec la directive donn\u00e9e dans le paragraphe 52.6(1) selon laquelle le bureau devrait, lorsqu'il statue sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'utilisation des ressources de la Chambre, tenir compte de l'esprit et de l'objet des r\u00e8glements administratifs pris aux termes du paragraphe 52.5(1). Le r\u00e8glement sur les bureaux des d\u00e9put\u00e9s, le r\u00e8glement no 301, traite express\u00e9ment de l'impression des bulletins parlementaires. Il est \u00e9vident \u00e0 la lecture du r\u00e8glement que son intention et son objet sont de r\u00e9gir l'administration des ressources de la Chambre (par exemple l'achat de mat\u00e9riel de bureau, les imprim\u00e9s et fournitures, la location de locaux, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du personnel, etc.). Le r\u00e8glement ne contient pas de dispositions se rapportant aux principes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ni, d'ailleurs, \u00e0 ce qui constitue un comportement d\u00e9cent ou respectable, pour utiliser la d\u00e9finition de proper avanc\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9.\n[13] La Cour d'appel de l'Ontario, dans l'arr\u00eat Ontario c. Bernier (1994), 70 O.A.C. 400, et la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec, dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Fontaine, [1995] A.Q. no 295 (QL), ont tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion. Dans les deux affaires, il y avait en litige la question de savoir si le paragraphe 52.6(1) enlevait aux cours la comp\u00e9tence d'entendre une affaire se rapportant aux accusations selon lesquelles un d\u00e9put\u00e9 avait utilis\u00e9 les fonds qui lui \u00e9taient allou\u00e9s par le bureau d'une mani\u00e8re qui contrevenait au Code criminel. Les deux cours ont conclu que le paragraphe 52.6(1) n'enlevait pas cette comp\u00e9tence et elles ont statu\u00e9 que ce paragraphe n'accorde au bureau que la comp\u00e9tence de d\u00e9cider si un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Chambre des communes a utilis\u00e9 ces ressources d'une mani\u00e8re compatible avec le r\u00e8glement. Il est significatif que le terme by-laws du texte anglais des paragraphes 52.5 et 52.6 soit rendu par r\u00e8glements administratifs dans la version fran\u00e7aise.\n[14] Comme Mme la juge Arbour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 4 de l'arr\u00eat Bernier, le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9tabli le bureau pour g\u00e9rer de fa\u00e7on exclusive le fonctionnement interne de la Chambre des communes. En faisant cela, le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas exprim\u00e9 une intention d'enlever aux cours leur comp\u00e9tence pour appliquer le Code criminel aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s. \u00c0 notre avis, la m\u00eame conclusion peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir si la LCDP a fait l'objet d'une violation. Le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas montr\u00e9 une intention d'exclure les d\u00e9put\u00e9s, et en particulier leurs bulletins parlementaires, de l'application de la LCDP.\nB. Privil\u00e8ge parlementaire ou immunit\u00e9 [15] Il ne nous semble pas non plus que la LPC, notamment l'article 52.6, \u00e9tend la port\u00e9e de tout privil\u00e8ge ou de toute immunit\u00e9 dont les d\u00e9put\u00e9s peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier. Le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire fournit aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s une immunit\u00e9 absolue contre les poursuites civiles ou criminelles lorsqu'ils parlent \u00e0 la Chambre des communes ou participent aux travaux du Parlement (voir J.P.J. Maingot, Parliamentary Privilege in Canada, 2e \u00e9d.). L'\u00e9tendue et la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire revendiqu\u00e9 ont vari\u00e9 au fil des ans. Mais comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Vaid (au paragraphe 23), une conception plus \u00e9troite s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e plus r\u00e9cemment. La Cour a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de 1971 rendue par le pr\u00e9sident de la Chambre qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire ne va pas beaucoup au-del\u00e0 du droit de libre parole \u00e0 la Chambre et du droit d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de s'acquitter de ses fonctions \u00e0 la Chambre en tant que repr\u00e9sentant aux Communes.\n[16] L'intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que l'immunit\u00e9 li\u00e9e au privil\u00e8ge parlementaire ne s'\u00e9tend pas aux d\u00e9clarations ou aux publications faites par les d\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Chambre ou en dehors des travaux parlementaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, les membres des l\u00e9gislatures ne sont pas immunis\u00e9s contre les poursuites p\u00e9nales pour les d\u00e9clarations faites \u00e0 la presse \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des Chambres du Parlement (voir Re : Ouellet (no 1 et no 2), [1976] C.A. 788) ni contre la responsabilit\u00e9 dans le contexte d'actions en diffamation pour des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es \u00e0 un journaliste \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'une assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative (voir Ward c. Clark, 2000 BCSC 979). Il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il n'y a pas d'immunit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'application de la LCDP.\nII. LA LCDP NE S'APPLIQUE PAS \u00c0 L'INTIM\u00c9 [17] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend en outre que la LCDP ne s'applique pas \u00e0 lui parce qu'il n'a pas la qualit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui le soumettrait au r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il n'a pas un travail f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, un engagement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou une entreprise f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et il ne fait pas non plus partie de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou du gouvernement du Canada. Le seul facteur qui le lie \u00e0 la sph\u00e8re d'activit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales est le fait que lorsqu'il communique avec les \u00e9lecteurs de sa circonscription au moyen d'un bulletin parlementaire, il ex\u00e9cute ses fonctions parlementaires en tant que d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Chambre des communes. Son argument est fond\u00e9 sur son affirmation selon laquelle la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement quant \u00e0 un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Chambre des communes se limite \u00e0 la LPC.\n[18] L'objet et la port\u00e9e de la LCDP sont bien exprim\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 2 et ne sont pas aussi limit\u00e9s que l'intim\u00e9 le donne \u00e0 entendre dans ses pr\u00e9tentions. La disposition \u00e9nonce que l'objet de la LCDP est de donner effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances qui y est d\u00e9crit.\n[19] \u00c0 notre avis, le langage de la LCDP est suffisamment large pour englober \u00e9galement les d\u00e9clarations faites par des d\u00e9put\u00e9s dans les bulletins parlementaires publi\u00e9s et pay\u00e9s par la Chambre des communes, en vertu d'une loi du Parlement, la LPC. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Parlement a promulgu\u00e9 ce cadre l\u00e9gislatif, qui en fin de compte r\u00e9git les bulletins parlementaires, il est clair que la publication et le contenu des bulletins parlementaires doivent n\u00e9cessairement faire partie du champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada.\nIII. LA S\u00c9PARATION ENTRE LE POUVOIR L\u00c9GISLATIF ET LE POUVOIR EX\u00c9CUTIF [20] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal est un tribunal administratif \u00e9tabli en vertu de la LCDP et, qu'\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il n'est pas distinct constitutionnellement de l'ex\u00e9cutif. Le fait de permettre au Tribunal d'examiner les communications d'un parlementaire et de d\u00e9cider du contenu de ces communications porterait atteinte \u00e0 la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e dans la Constitution.\n[21] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Re: Alberta Legislation, [1938] R.C.S. 100, \u00e0 la page 133, la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 pr\u00e9voit un Parlement qui fonctionne sous le feu de l'opinion publique et de la libre discussion. L'institution tire son efficacit\u00e9 de la libre discussion des affaires et de [TRADUCTION] l'analyse et de l'examen le plus libre et le plus complet de chaque point de vue \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les projets politiques. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que ce principe \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] particuli\u00e8rement vrai en ce qui concerne [TRADUCTION] la fa\u00e7on dont s'acquittent [...] les d\u00e9put\u00e9s du Parlement de leurs devoirs envers les \u00e9lecteurs. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que l'expression d'un point de vue par un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Chambre des communes est un discours politique et que seulement les \u00e9lecteurs devraient en faire l'examen au moyen du processus d\u00e9mocratique. Aucun tiers, en particulier un repr\u00e9sentant du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif d'un \u00c9tat, ne devrait pouvoir s'ing\u00e9rer dans ce d\u00e9bat et cet \u00e9change d'id\u00e9es libres et sans entraves au sein d'une l\u00e9gislature.\n[22] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que le gouvernement ne devrait avoir aucune voix ou aucun contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la libert\u00e9 d'expression d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Chambre, en particulier d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de l'opposition, comme l'intim\u00e9. Le fait de permettre que le contenu de bulletins parlementaires et d'autres formes de discours politiques des d\u00e9put\u00e9s soit examin\u00e9 limiterait la capacit\u00e9 de ces derniers d'exprimer \u00e0 fond leurs opinions. Cela aurait ensuite un effet paralysant sur le d\u00e9bat libre et public de diverses opinions. Cela aurait \u00e9galement comme cons\u00e9quence de priver les \u00e9lecteurs du v\u00e9ritable point de vue du d\u00e9put\u00e9 en emp\u00eachant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous les renseignements francs requis pour prendre une d\u00e9cision totalement \u00e9clair\u00e9e.\n[23] Dans l'arr\u00eat Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. c. Colombie-Britannique (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch), 2001 CSC 52, au paragraphe 32, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a mentionn\u00e9 que bien que les tribunaux administratifs chevauchent la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre le judiciaire et l'ex\u00e9cutif et exercent une fonction d\u00e9cisionnelle, ils fonctionnent en fin de compte dans le cadre du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif de l'\u00c9tat, conform\u00e9ment au mandat confi\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature. Cependant, il convient de noter que cette affaire se rapportait au degr\u00e9 d'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle requis d'un bureau des permis dont, selon ce que la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, sa fonction premi\u00e8re est l'octroi des permis et qui est loin de poss\u00e9der les attributs constitutionnels des tribunaux judiciaires (au paragraphe 33).\n[24] Plus r\u00e9cemment, dans l'arr\u00eat Bell c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36, la Cour supr\u00eame a trait\u00e9 de la question de l'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. La Cour a d\u00e9crit le Tribunal comme suit :\n[25] La principale fonction du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est de nature juridictionnelle. Il tient des audiences formelles sur les plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission. Il d\u00e9tient plusieurs des pouvoirs d'une cour de justice. Il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer sur des faits, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter et \u00e0 appliquer le droit aux faits qui lui sont soumis et \u00e0 accorder les redressements appropri\u00e9s. De plus, ses audiences sont structur\u00e9es sensiblement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice. Les parties en pr\u00e9sence devant le tribunal pr\u00e9sentent une preuve, font entendre et contre-interrogent des t\u00e9moins, et pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur l'application du droit aux faits. Le Tribunal ne participe pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des politiques et ne m\u00e8ne pas ses propres enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes sur les plaintes : le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment attribu\u00e9 les fonctions d'enqu\u00eate et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques \u00e0 un organisme diff\u00e9rent, soit la Commission.\n[26] La Cour supr\u00eame a tir\u00e9 la conclusion selon laquelle ce tribunal a un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'ind\u00e9pendance par rapport \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cutif. \u00c0 notre avis, compte tenu de cette conclusion de la Cour supr\u00eame, le fait de traiter le Tribunal comme une branche du gouvernement aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire est hautement discutable.\n[27] Le principe de la s\u00e9paration entre les trois pouvoirs - ex\u00e9cutif, l\u00e9gislatif et judiciaire - tire sa source du pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, qui exige une constitution reposant sur les m\u00eames principes que celle du Royaume-Uni. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Vaid, au paragraphe 21, chacun des pouvoirs de l'\u00c9tat se voit garantir une certaine autonomie par rapport aux autres. Le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire constitue l'un des moyens qui permettent d'assurer le respect de ce principe. Dans l'arr\u00eat Vaid, la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que la Chambre puisse exercer ses activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gislatives libre de toute ing\u00e9rence de la part d'organismes ou d'institutions externes, y compris les tribunaux. Par exemple, la Cour a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il serait inacceptable qu'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00e0 qui le pr\u00e9sident n'aurait pas accord\u00e9 la parole pendant la p\u00e9riode des questions puisse d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il a fait l'objet de discrimination ou qu'il puisse demander aux tribunaux ordinaires de d\u00e9clarer qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9 d'expression pr\u00e9vue par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (arr\u00eat Vaid, au paragraphe 20). Il s'agit de v\u00e9ritables questions internes relevant de la Chambre que celle-ci doit r\u00e9gler suivant sa propre proc\u00e9dure.\n[28] L'intim\u00e9 a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Taylor c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2000] 3 C.F. 298, une affaire dans laquelle une plainte suivant la LCDP avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre un juge de la Cour de l'Ontario, Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le juge avait soi-disant ordonn\u00e9 que le plaignant, qui \u00e9tait assis dans la salle d'audience, enl\u00e8ve le couvre-chef qu'il portait et qui faisait partie de sa pratique religieuse. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que le principe de l'immunit\u00e9 judiciaire s'applique afin d'emp\u00eacher que des proc\u00e9dures contre des juges soient engag\u00e9es devant la Commission et en fin de compte devant le Tribunal. Le principe de l'immunit\u00e9 judiciaire existe pour garantir que les juges ex\u00e9cutent leurs fonctions en toute ind\u00e9pendance et sans crainte. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que tout comme l'ind\u00e9pendance du pouvoir judiciaire, l'ind\u00e9pendance du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif doit \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Le Tribunal n'a par cons\u00e9quent pas comp\u00e9tence pour s'ing\u00e9rer dans l'un ou l'autre de ces pouvoirs.\n[29] Toutefois, il faut examiner l'arr\u00eat Taylor selon son contexte factuel. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a mentionn\u00e9 que la Cour avait un pouvoir inh\u00e9rent de rendre des ordonnances pour assurer l'ordre et le d\u00e9corum dans les salles d'audience au cours des d\u00e9bats. Le juge s'\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un acte purement judiciaire pour lequel il existe une immunit\u00e9 judiciaire.\n[30] Il n'y a pas de doute que des d\u00e9clarations faites par un membre de la Chambre des communes constituent une fonction l\u00e9gislative inh\u00e9rente qui fait l'objet de l'immunit\u00e9 li\u00e9e au privil\u00e8ge parlementaire. Aucune autorit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure ne peut non plus s'ing\u00e9rer dans cette activit\u00e9. Mais comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire ne se rapporte pas aux d\u00e9clarations contenues dans les bulletins parlementaires qui sont distribu\u00e9s aux \u00e9lecteurs. \u00c0 notre avis, cette situation n'est pas analogue \u00e0 l'exemple donn\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Vaid ou aux faits de l'arr\u00eat Taylor.\n[31] La pr\u00e9sente affaire peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de l'affaire Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) c. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 595 (C.A. Ont.). Il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne que la r\u00e9citation quotidienne du Notre P\u00e8re par le pr\u00e9sident de l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative contrevenait au Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario. L'intim\u00e9 a renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 19 dans lequel la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne est simplement une [TRADUCTION] cr\u00e9ation de la Couronne et est soumise, \u00e0 tout le moins, aux m\u00eames restrictions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative que le sont le judiciaire et l'ex\u00e9cutif. La question \u00e0 trancher par la Cour \u00e9tait celle de savoir si la r\u00e9citation quotidienne du Notre P\u00e8re \u00e9tait une question se rapportant de fa\u00e7on inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la conduite des travaux \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative. La Cour a conclu que c'\u00e9tait le cas et que le Code ne s'appliquait par cons\u00e9quent pas en raison de l'immunit\u00e9 parlementaire.\n[32] Finalement, nous notons en outre que bien que la Cour supr\u00eame, dans l'arr\u00eat Re: Alberta Legislation, ait mis l'accent sur l'importance dans notre d\u00e9mocratie de maintenir le droit \u00e0 l'opinion publique et le droit \u00e0 la libre discussion, ces droits ne sont pas absolus. La Cour a reconnu que ces valeurs font l'objet de limites l\u00e9gales, comme les dispositions du Code criminel et la common law. La Charte et la LCDP imposent \u00e9galement des limites l\u00e9gales \u00e0 l'opinion publique et \u00e0 la libre discussion.\nPour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

D\u00e9cision\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nLa demande [1] Mme Rubio compara\u00eet en tant que mandataire du plaignant. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vue d'obtenir la traduction en espagnol des proc\u00e9dures. Elle demande que le Tribunal paie les frais de la traduction.\n[2] J'ai eu la possibilit\u00e9 de poser de nombreuses questions au plaignant lorsque la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Je suis convaincu, compte tenu de ses r\u00e9ponses et des renseignements fournis par Mme Rubio, qu'il ne ma\u00eetrise pas bien l'anglais. Il est difficile de dire jusqu'o\u00f9 va sa connaissance de l'anglais. Il m'a compris lorsque je lui ai demand\u00e9 comment il pouvait travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e sans parler anglais.\n[3] J'agis en tenant pour acquis que le plaignant comprend un peu l'anglais, mais ne peut le parler. Son niveau de compr\u00e9hension est faible. Le greffe a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni la traduction de son t\u00e9moignage, compte tenu d'une directive pr\u00e9voyant qu'une traduction est fournie aux t\u00e9moins qui ont de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la langue des proc\u00e9dures.\n[4] Le plaignant pr\u00e9sente maintenant une demande en vue d'obtenir la traduction des autres proc\u00e9dures.\nLe plaignant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'assistance d'une mandataire [5] Je pense que le fait que le plaignant ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'assistance d'une mandataire est un fait important. Bien que M. Filgueira ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent au cours de toute l'instruction, il est un participant passif et il a laiss\u00e9 Mme Rubio mener sa cause. Elle communique avec lui en espagnol, sa langue maternelle, et elle l'a tenu au courant de l'avancement de l'audience.\n[6] Mme Rubio n'est pas avocate et elle ne compara\u00eet pas en tant qu'avocate. Elle ne compara\u00eet que parce que le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 une autorisation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLe droit d'obtenir la traduction des proc\u00e9dures [7] Je ne connais aucun cas traitant de la question qui m'est soumise dans le contexte d'une instance en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Je n'ai pas non plus eu le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'une argumentation compl\u00e8te en droit. Par cons\u00e9quent, je limiterai mes commentaires.\n[8] Le droit d'obtenir dans une langue autre que l'anglais ou le fran\u00e7ais la traduction des proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal a probablement trois sources juridiques. La premi\u00e8re est la common law. La deuxi\u00e8me est l'article 14 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. La troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9sulte de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nLa common law [9] La common law semble traiter le droit d'obtenir la traduction des proc\u00e9dures comme une question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que ce qui est \u00e9quitable variera selon les circonstances de chaque cas. La norme est beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re criminelle.\n[10] Je pense que la common law s'applique toujours. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e9nonce que le Tribunal donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs causes. Cette possibilit\u00e9 fait intervenir les principes de justice naturelle, qui peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 des droits proc\u00e9duraux dans certaines situations. Les parties doivent pouvoir pr\u00e9senter leurs causes et r\u00e9pondre aux arguments de l'autre partie. Cela peut requ\u00e9rir les services d'un traducteur.\n[11] Le but de la traduction est de prot\u00e9ger l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus. Un tribunal auquel on demande une traduction doit d\u00e9cider si une traduction est n\u00e9cessaire selon les circonstances de l'affaire. La question est celle de savoir si le d\u00e9faut de fournir la traduction compromettrait l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus. Le besoin doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et imp\u00e9rieux.\nL'article 14 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s [12] L'article 14 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\n14. La partie ou le t\u00e9moin qui ne peuvent suivre les proc\u00e9dures, soit parce qu'ils ne comprennent pas ou ne parlent pas la langue employ\u00e9e, soit parce qu'ils sont atteints de surdit\u00e9, ont droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te.\nBien qu'il s'agisse d'une affaire en mati\u00e8re criminelle, l'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada R. c. Tran, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 951, \u00e9tablit que les parties dans des proc\u00e9dures civiles et administratives jouissent des droits garantis par l'article 14. M. le juge en chef Lamer a tenu \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser, cependant, \u00e0 la page 93, que les r\u00e8gles qui s'appliquent dans diff\u00e9rents domaines du droit doivent \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9es dans des affaires qui surviennent dans ces domaines.\n[13] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne m'a fourni l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Mohammadian c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration), [2001] A.C.F. no 916, dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 que les demandeurs devant la Section du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 avaient droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te suivant l'article 14. Cet arr\u00eat est utile. Je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il a une influence sur la pr\u00e9misse fondamentale selon laquelle le droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te peut exiger diff\u00e9rentes choses dans diff\u00e9rents domaines du droit.\n[14] Le litige devant le Tribunal fait appel aux droits de la personne et soul\u00e8ve par cons\u00e9quent des questions d'une importance fondamentale. Toutefois, le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ne soul\u00e8ve pas les m\u00eames sortes de pr\u00e9occupations que celles soulev\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Il peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre distingu\u00e9 des affaires en mati\u00e8re d'immigration et de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s qui traitent directement du statut juridique de l'individu.\n[15] Bien qu'il y ait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment public dans tous les litiges en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, la pr\u00e9sente affaire a les caract\u00e9ristiques d'un litige priv\u00e9. Le plaignant tente d'obtenir des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. La principale question qui m'est soumise est celle de savoir si le plaignant a subi de la discrimination quant \u00e0 sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Il s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Travail Canada \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'une des questions qui me sont soumises.\nLes points de droit [16] Il existe d'autres raisons pour lesquelles le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre prudent dans son application de l'article 14. Premi\u00e8rement, le droit pr\u00e9vu par l'article 14 est sujet \u00e0 des limites raisonnables envisag\u00e9es par l'article 1 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. Bien que je n'aie pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'observations sur cette question, il reste simplement que le droit pr\u00e9vu par l'article 14 n'est pas absolu.\n[17] Le libell\u00e9 de l'article est en outre notable. L'article 14 donne \u00e0 une partie qui ne parle pas la langue employ\u00e9e dans les proc\u00e9dures le droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te. L'article ne dit pas que la partie a le droit d'obtenir une traduction officielle des proc\u00e9dures. La traduction peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire dans le contexte d'accusations criminelles ou dans le contexte d'autres lois en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale. Mais les deux formulations ne sont pas les m\u00eames.\n[18] Il existe une diff\u00e9rence r\u00e9elle entre un droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te et un droit d'obtenir la traduction de l'audience. Cette diff\u00e9rence est illustr\u00e9e par la pratique du Tribunal, qui utilise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la traduction simultan\u00e9e. La traduction simultan\u00e9e est rapide et efficace et est conforme au mandat du Tribunal. Cependant, la logistique de ce mode de traduction est telle que la traduction ne peut \u00eatre fournie \u00e0 moins qu'il y ait trois interpr\u00e8tes. Le processus requiert en outre qu'une personne surveille les microphones et les haut-parleurs n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir le service.\n[19] Le fait est simplement qu'il peut y avoir des interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes de la port\u00e9e de l'article 14. Il est possible de fournir une traduction cons\u00e9cutive, avec un interpr\u00e8te, mais c'est l\u00e0 un processus plus encombrant qui comporte ses propres co\u00fbts et inefficacit\u00e9s. Il peut y avoir des moyens moins officiels de respecter les exigences de l'article, mais on ne m'en a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun.\nLa nature du droit [20] La nature du droit pr\u00e9vu par l'article 14 devrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Le Tribunal devrait se m\u00e9fier des normes absolues ou rh\u00e9toriques, qui ne comportent pas les liens n\u00e9cessaires avec la t\u00e2che en cause. La t\u00e2che du Tribunal est de s'assurer que justice soit rendue dans l'affaire qui lui est soumise. Je pense que cela exige une norme pragmatique, plut\u00f4t qu'une norme abstraite, qui reconna\u00eet que le droit garanti par l'article 14 est d\u00e9terminant.\n[21] Un tribunal ne devrait pas oublier que le droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te sert un objectif plus large. Cet objectif consiste \u00e0 s'assurer que les parties \u00e0 une instance judiciaire peuvent participer au processus de fa\u00e7on significative et efficace, d'une mani\u00e8re qui garantit l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, la profondeur et en fin de compte la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du processus.\n[22] Le but de l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te est de faire avancer le processus. Il existe de nombreux principes proc\u00e9duraux, comme la justice naturelle et certains aspects du droit de pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9ponse et une d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8tes, qui interviennent dans ce contexte. Je pense qu'aucun de ces principes n'est exhaustif. Ils garantissent simplement le droit de chaque partie d'\u00eatre entendue par le Tribunal.\n[23] Par exemple, cela ressort de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente dans le passage tir\u00e9 de l'ouvrage de Donald G.M. Brown et John M. Evans, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 1998), \u00e0 10:4100, o\u00f9 ils d\u00e9clarent ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] une personne qui a le droit d'\u00eatre entendue dans une instance devant une cour, ou devant un tribunal administratif, a droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te pour garantir qu'elle puisse pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des arguments, d'une mani\u00e8re qui peut \u00eatre entendue par le d\u00e9cideur, et r\u00e9pondre aux t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins et \u00e0 tout ce que dit l'arbitre.\nJe pense que ce passage contient une d\u00e9claration utile quant aux obligations du Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nLa Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [24] La troisi\u00e8me source du droit d'obtenir une traduction peut \u00eatre la plus difficile d'un point de vue juridique. Deux pr\u00e9tentions fondamentales m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. La premi\u00e8re est que le Tribunal a une obligation de mettre le plaignant dans la m\u00eame situation que celle d'un plaideur qui comprend la langue des proc\u00e9dures. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que toute situation moins avantageuse est implicitement discriminatoire et contrevient \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Loi interdit la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[25] Cette pr\u00e9tention est en harmonie avec la Loi. L'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne interdit la discrimination dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public. Selon moi, il ne fait pas de doute que le greffe du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne fournit de nombreux services au public. Il a une obligation fondamentale de respecter le principe de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui se trouve au cur de la Loi et il ne peut pas exercer de la discrimination dans la fourniture de ces services.\n[26] La deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9tention est que le Tribunal a une obligation d'accommodation \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Filgueira. Cette pr\u00e9tention m\u00e9rite un examen s\u00e9rieux. Je pense qu'il est clair que le Tribunal a une obligation, en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et probablement en vertu du droit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de fournir une accommodation \u00e0 une personne qui souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience physique ou psychologique. L'exemple \u00e9vident est probablement la fourniture d'une certaine forme d'assistance \u00e0 des individus qui ont des d\u00e9ficiences visuelles ou auditives.\n[27] La question est celle de savoir si la m\u00eame logique exige qu'une assistance soit fournie aux membres de minorit\u00e9s linguistiques. Je pense que la r\u00e9ponse est probablement affirmative. La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit que le Tribunal aurait une obligation de fournir au plaignant un interpr\u00e8te s'il \u00e9tait atteint de surdit\u00e9. Dans certaines circonstances, du moins, une langue peut d\u00e9savantager une partie et miner son droit de participer pleinement au processus. La t\u00e2che la plus difficile consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider le niveau d'assistance qui est requis.\n[28] La question est plus complexe qu'elle peut sembler l'\u00eatre. Je pense qu'il est probablement n\u00e9cessaire de faire la distinction entre les fonctions administratives et les fonctions adjudicatives du Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte. Le greffe a la t\u00e2che de fournir les services qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour permettre aux parties de participer ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l'instruction. Les fonctions des membres instructeurs qui entendent les affaires rel\u00e8vent d'un autre domaine.\n[29] La pr\u00e9sente affaire comporte des questions fondamentales. Je fais cette affirmation parce qu'il existe une question quant \u00e0 savoir si la tenue d'une instruction suivant la Loi, comme le processus judiciaire en soi, peut \u00eatre correctement d\u00e9crite comme un service public. Il existe au moins certains motifs de penser le contraire. Il ne faut pas laisser les aspects physiques et logistiques d'une instruction nuire aux exigences du processus. Je ne vois pas de quelle fa\u00e7on un tribunal peut fournir une accommodation aux parties, par exemple, et les prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des rigueurs du contre-interrogatoire.\n[30] Je ne tranche pas cette question. Cependant, l'objectif d'une instruction consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et \u00e0 fournir une certaine mesure de justice aux parties. Ces aspects doivent intervenir en premier lieu dans tout examen des responsabilit\u00e9s du Tribunal envers les plaideurs. Toute demande d'accommodation doit respecter les limites que cela place in\u00e9vitablement sur la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal de fournir des accommodations.\n[31] Peu importe les obligations du Tribunal, je pense que mon analyse des questions soulev\u00e9es suivant la common law et la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s est suffisante pour traiter de la pr\u00e9sente demande. Je ne pense pas que les obligations du Tribunal pr\u00e9vues par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne requi\u00e8rent que les autres proc\u00e9dures soient traduites.\nConclusion [32] Il est tr\u00e8s facile de dire que M. Filgueira devrait \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame situation que celle dans laquelle se trouve un plaideur dont la langue maternelle, et la langue dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9, est la langue des proc\u00e9dures. Le probl\u00e8me est que cela n'a pas une tr\u00e8s grande signification une fois que les diff\u00e9rences dans l'\u00e9ducation, la mani\u00e8re dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 et l'intelligence naturelle sont prises en compte. L'id\u00e9e selon laquelle le plaignant doit comprendre chaque mot prononc\u00e9 lors d'une audience a peu de liens avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n[33] Le niveau de compr\u00e9hension requis pour pouvoir participer pleinement \u00e0 une audience est relativement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Une partie doit \u00eatre capable de prendre les d\u00e9cisions qui doivent \u00eatre prises afin de poursuivre l'affaire. Cela exige une compr\u00e9hension du processus r\u00e9el. Cela requiert \u00e9galement une certaine appr\u00e9ciation de l'importance du processus et des cons\u00e9quences qui s'y rattachent.\n[34] Les parties ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation et je suis d'avis, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, que le plaignant a une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l'affaire. De plus, il reste simplement que le plaignant a en l'esp\u00e8ce l'assistance d'une mandataire qui parle sa langue. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il a discut\u00e9 longuement de l'affaire avec Mme Rubio et qu'il est en contact continu avec elle. De fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente, ils ont discut\u00e9 de la preuve qui devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et de ce que ses t\u00e9moins diront.\n[35] J'aurais pens\u00e9 que le but d'avoir un mandataire, en plus du fait qu'il m\u00e8ne l'affaire en son nom, est de s'assurer que le plaignant comprenne le processus. Mme Rubio ne peut parler au nom de M. Filgueira au cours de l'audience sans lui faire un compte rendu. Il n'y a rien de lourd dans cette fa\u00e7on d'agir. Cela fait partie de la conversation ordinaire qui doit avoir lieu entre tout plaideur et la personne qui compara\u00eet en son nom.\n[36] Personne ne demande \u00e0 Mme Rubio de traduire les proc\u00e9dures ou de prendre \u00e0 sa charge le r\u00f4le d'un interpr\u00e8te. Cependant, il n'y a pas de ligne simple de d\u00e9marcation entre les fonctions d'un interpr\u00e8te et celles d'un mandataire. Les limites se chevauchent. Je pense qu'il est clair que l'une des raisons pour lesquelles Mme Rubio agit au nom du plaignant est qu'elle parle espagnol.\n[37] La question de fond et la question pratique sont li\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce. En tant que mandataire, Mme Rubio compara\u00eet dans un certain sens juridique comme un prolongement de M. Filgueira. D'un point de vue pratique, elle doit comprendre exactement ce qui se passe au cours de l'audience. Mais naturellement, elle comprend. La question de droit est celle de savoir si sa compr\u00e9hension passe \u00e0 M. Filgueira. Si une personne compara\u00eet en tant que mandataire, en la capacit\u00e9 d'une partie en particulier, sa compr\u00e9hension du processus peut-elle \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie au nom de laquelle elle agit?\n[38] Je pense que la pr\u00e9misse fondamentale d'une instruction est que les parties comprennent le processus. Il y a une certaine partie de cette exigence qui est personnelle, que la partie comparaisse elle-m\u00eame ou avec un mandataire. La compr\u00e9hension ne peut pas \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les parties doivent savoir ce qui se passe. Je pense n\u00e9anmoins que la participation de Mme Rubio \u00e0 l'audience doit \u00eatre prise en compte lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9cider si M. Filgueira a un droit d'obtenir la traduction en espagnol des proc\u00e9dures.\n[39] S'il comparaissait seul, je suppose que M. Filgueira aurait droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un interpr\u00e8te pour la dur\u00e9e de l'audience. Il existe des raisons proc\u00e9durales et des raisons pratiques pour lesquelles cela doit \u00eatre le cas. Il ne serait pas possible de tenir une audience sans cela. Cependant, le fait est que le plaignant ne compara\u00eet pas seul.\n[40] Je reconnais naturellement que M. Filgueira a le droit d'\u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame situation que d'autres plaideurs. Cependant, cela ne requiert pas la traduction des proc\u00e9dures. Ce droit requiert qu'il ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re, selon les mots de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de pr\u00e9senter sa cause et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'autre partie. Je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire tout ce que je peux raisonnablement faire, afin de garantir la protection de ses droits.\n[41] Le Tribunal est tenu de faire preuve de prudence dans des affaires de poursuites publiques. Les ressources sont toujours limit\u00e9es. Toutes les autres questions mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9, le co\u00fbt d'\u00e9tablir des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9, que la question soit trait\u00e9e suivant la common law, l'article 1 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s ou la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je ne fais pas de commentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des crit\u00e8res qui s'appliquent dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte. Je suis n\u00e9anmoins convaincu que, selon l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, certaines parties de la pr\u00e9sente instruction doivent \u00eatre traduites.\n[42] Mme Rubio a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que certains t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8veront des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le plaignant ex\u00e9cutait ses fonctions. Elle pr\u00e9tend que cette preuve est nouvelle. Il se peut que cette preuve soit \u00e9galement essentielle \u00e0 l'affaire. Je partage l'opinion selon laquelle M. Filgueira doit savoir ce que les t\u00e9moins disent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, s'il doit en discuter avec la personne qui compara\u00eet en son nom.\n[43] Je suis par cons\u00e9quent dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner que la traduction de cette portion de l'affaire soit fournie au plaignant. L'application de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision au t\u00e9moignage de t\u00e9moins particuliers pourra \u00eatre discut\u00e9e au moment opportun.\nD\u00e9cision [44] Une ordonnance en ce sens est donc rendue.\nM.

Il existe toutefois une rserve cet gard au paragraphe 9(12) des Rgles de procdure du Tribunal qui prvoit que, moins d'une ordonnance contraire du Tribunal, les intrts accords doivent tre calculs pour une priode et un taux prcis. Dans la prsente dcision, ce taux est nomm le taux d'intrt par dfaut .\n[2] CEP proposera (en supposant qu'il soit conclu une responsabilit) que le Tribunal accorde des intrts un taux diffrent du taux d'intrt par dfaut. CEP propose en outre de faire appel M. Stephen Gould afin d'obtenir son tmoignage d'expert l'gard du taux d'intrt et de la priode de calcul appropris pour les intrts qui seront accords.\n[3] Bell a prsent une requte par laquelle elle demande au Tribunal de ne pas accepter le tmoignage de M. Gould. Bell prtend que cette preuve n'est pas ncessaire pour que le Tribunal tablisse les intrts appropris.\n[4] Aux fins de ses prtentions l'gard de la requte, Bell sollicite l'introduction en preuve du fait que le Tribunal, lorsqu'il a modifi le taux d'intrt par dfaut en 2004, n'a pas obtenu un avis d'expert. La prtention de Bell sera qu'il n'tait alors pas ncessaire d'avoir l'assistance d'un expert et que, par consquent, cela n'est pas ncessaire maintenant.\n[5] l'gard de la requte prsente par Bell, le Tribunal doit trancher la question de savoir si, selon les faits et les circonstances de la prsente affaire, le tmoignage de M.

D\u00c9CISION\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de non-lieu. Apr\u00e8s que M. Capp eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la demande, mais avant qu'il eut conclu ses remarques, Mme Rubio s'est oppos\u00e9e en soumettant que l'intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9cider si il pr\u00e9sentera certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avant de pr\u00e9senter une demande de non-lieu. Je lui ai permis de soulever l'objection et j'ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je trancherais cette question avant d'aller plus loin.\nII. LA JURISPRUDENCE [2] Mme Rubio invoque la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 5 (QL), dans laquelle M. Hadjis a soulign\u00e9 que divers tribunaux et diverses commissions avaient rendu des d\u00e9cisions diff\u00e9rentes sur cette question. Il a ensuite appliqu\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle dans les tribunaux civils. Il semble que cela n\u00e9cessite que la partie d\u00e9fenderesse fasse un choix avant de pr\u00e9senter une demande de non-lieu.\n[3] L'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de principe de Chopra se trouve au paragraphe 22 de cette d\u00e9cision :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la r\u00e8gle du choix en common law s'applique \u00e0 notre Tribunal mais que les parties peuvent, d'une part, renoncer \u00e0 son application, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, et que, d'autre part, si les circonstances le justifient, le Tribunal peut soustraire l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'application de cette r\u00e8gle Je crois qu'il y a place \u00e0 des opinions diff\u00e9rentes. Je suis d'accord avec M. Hadjis que la question devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en fonction des circonstances de chaque esp\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal jouit d'une latitude plus grande qu'une cour de justice dans ce genre d'affaires.\n[4] La d\u00e9cision rendue dans Chopra s'appuie largement sur une d\u00e9cision rendue par une commission d'enqu\u00eate ontarienne dans Nimako c. C.N. Hotels, (1985) 6 C.H.R.R. D\/2894. Je me sens oblig\u00e9 d'affirmer que la Commission, dans Nimako, semble avoir mal compris la nature d'une demande de non-lieu. Il est faux de pr\u00e9tendre qu'un Tribunal qui examine une demande de non-lieu risque de d\u00e9cider la cause \u00e0 deux reprises. Un Tribunal qui accueille une requ\u00eate n'a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la cause au sens juridique. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y a aucune preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer.\n[5] M. Hadjis renvoie \u00e9galement, toutefois, \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par une commission d'enqu\u00eate ult\u00e9rieure dans Potocnik c. Thunder Bay (Ville), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 16. La situation dans Potocnik \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celle dont je suis saisi. L'avocat a inform\u00e9 la commission que, si on lui donnait le choix, l'intim\u00e9e produirait une preuve avant de demander le non-lieu. M. Capp a fait la m\u00eame chose. La Commission dans Potocnik n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de faire son choix avant de demander un non-lieu.\nIII. LES FRAIS [6] Je n'ai pas eu le luxe d'analyser le raisonnement derri\u00e8re l'introduction de la r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re civile. M. Capp affirme que la pratique dans les cours de justice a chang\u00e9 au cours des trente-cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Il existe n\u00e9anmoins une diff\u00e9rence fondamentale entre le processus en mati\u00e8re civile et le processus en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne, lequel a une incidence sur l'application de la r\u00e8gle.\n[7] Cette diff\u00e9rence est une diff\u00e9rence de nature pratique. Un intim\u00e9 qui produit une preuve dans une cour civile peut recouvrer ses frais \u00e0 la fin de la cause. Cela n'est pas possible en vertu de Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. M\u00eame si le plaignant n'a produit aucune preuve contre lui, l'intim\u00e9 devra payer les d\u00e9penses qu'il a encourues en pr\u00e9sentant sa d\u00e9fense. Ces d\u00e9penses sont de toute \u00e9vidence importantes. \u00c0 part les frais juridiques, M. Capp a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que d'autres frais avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus en raison du fait que certains de ses t\u00e9moins venaient de l'ext\u00e9rieur de la ville.\n[8] Ce genre de probl\u00e8me ne d\u00e9pend pas de l'intim\u00e9. La Commission, dans Potocnik, a examin\u00e9 le co\u00fbt de la poursuite de l'audience en d\u00e9cidant de laisser l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9senter une demande de non-lieu avant de faire son choix.\n[Traduction]\n13. La Ville a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 le co\u00fbt de la pr\u00e9sente audience, et renvoie \u00e0 Tomen c. O.T.F. (no 3) (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/24 [...] Dans cette cause, la Commission d'enqu\u00eate [...] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la pratique normale suivie en cour civile laquelle consiste \u00e0 ordonner de faire un choix. Un des motifs cit\u00e9s par la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 le co\u00fbt important de l'audience [... ] La Ville souligne que c'est le secteur public qui r\u00e8gle les factures de toutes les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente audience et que celui-ci est actuellement confront\u00e9 \u00e0 de grandes contraintes financi\u00e8res et elle pr\u00e9tend que si la pr\u00e9sente audience peut prendre fin, alors qu'elle prenne tout simplement fin.\nCes co\u00fbts sont r\u00e9els. Je croirais que cela aide \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi la loi permet au d\u00e9part le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une demande de non-lieu.\n[9] Je souscris \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que la question des co\u00fbts est plus pressente dans le cas d'un employeur priv\u00e9. Il semble plut\u00f4t cavalier d'affirmer que ces genres de d\u00e9penses font tout simplement partie du prix \u00e0 payer pour faire des affaires. M. Capp a candidement affirm\u00e9 que son client n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire \u00e9voluer le droit ou \u00e0 contribuer aux dossiers publics. La principale pr\u00e9occupation de l'employeur en l'esp\u00e8ce est de nature financi\u00e8re, et ce, avec raison. Je ne suis saisi d'aucune question de politique.\n[10] Je crois que la Commission, dans Potocnik, ne faisait tout simplement qu'agir de fa\u00e7on responsable. Il ne s'agit pas en l'esp\u00e8ce de discuter du crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 un non-lieu. Le seuil est cependant tr\u00e8s bas et l'intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu'il n'existe aucune preuve contre elle. Si c'est le cas, pourquoi le Tribunal devrait-il demander que les parties et le public payent les co\u00fbts importants associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la poursuite du processus? Il existe un point en-de\u00e7a duquel les d\u00e9penses, les tracas et les inconv\u00e9nients li\u00e9s \u00e0 la participation \u00e0 une audience ne peuvent \u00eatre justifi\u00e9s. Les \u00e9conomies r\u00e9alis\u00e9es si une cause n'est pas entendue b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient \u00e0 toutes les parties, notamment au plaignant.\nIV. SONDER LE TERRAIN [11] Mme Rubio a fait valoir qu'il serait injuste de laisser l'intim\u00e9e sonder le terrain en pr\u00e9sentant une demande de non-lieu. Je crois que l'on veut dire que l'intim\u00e9e tire un avantage injuste si sa requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e car le Tribunal peut, pour l'une ou l'autre raison, r\u00e9v\u00e9ler son id\u00e9e sur la cause. Ce genre de crainte est injustifi\u00e9e. Le r\u00f4le d'un tribunal dans le cas d'une demande de non-lieu consiste tout simplement \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'appui des all\u00e9gations du plaignant. Il n'y a aucune appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve et rien \u00e0 ajouter si la demande est rejet\u00e9e. Le Tribunal n'a rendu aucun jugement et sa neutralit\u00e9 demeure enti\u00e8re.\n[12] Les obligations initiales du plaignant sont de nature minimale. On ne devrait pas permettre au plaignant de s'y soustraire. Il ne suffit pas non plus de dire que l'on devrait permettre au plaignant de corriger les lacunes figurant dans son dossier lorsque l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente sa preuve. Un Tribunal qui accueille une demande de non-lieu a conclu qu'il n'existe pas de preuve suffisante. Un bon nombre des justifications qui sont cit\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence ne s'appliquent pas, sauf si le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de ses all\u00e9gations. L'intim\u00e9e n'est pas oblig\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations gratuites.\n[13] C'est une chose s\u00e9rieuse que d'exiger qu'une partie qui prend part \u00e0 un processus juridictionnel r\u00e9ponde publiquement \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations juridiques. Une partie qui poursuit en justice dans une ar\u00e8ne judiciaire ou quasi-judiciaire est tenue de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions. Je pense qu'il s'agit-l\u00e0 de l'un des principes de la justice fondamentale. Qu'y a-t-il d'injuste \u00e0 conclure qu'un intim\u00e9 n'est pas tenu de produire une d\u00e9fense dans une situation o\u00f9 il n'y aucune preuve contre lui?\nV. LE BIEN-FOND\u00c9 [14] Il peut y avoir de bonnes raisons d'exiger de faire un choix dans certaines causes. Je suis certain qu'il y a des cas o\u00f9 une demande de non-lieu est frivole ou entrave le processus. Il incombe au tribunal qui entend une cause donn\u00e9e de d\u00e9cider ce qui est appropri\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[15] Divers facteurs peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte dans ce contexte. Entre autres choses, je crois qu'un tribunal a le droit d'examiner si une requ\u00eate est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e de bonne foi. C'est Mme Rubio qui a soulev\u00e9 cette question en pr\u00e9tendant que la demande dont je suis saisi n'a aucun bien-fond\u00e9. Elle ne voulait pas qua2lifier la demande de frivole. Elle a n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle \u00e9tait de nature tactique et regorgeait d'opportunisme.\n[16] Je n'accepte pas ces pr\u00e9tentions. Je crois que c'est l'autre partie qui fait preuve de tactiques. C'est le plaignant qui tente d'\u00e9viter une requ\u00eate l\u00e9gitime qui peut porter un coup fatal \u00e0 sa cause. Cela est compr\u00e9hensible, mais ne donne gu\u00e8re de motif rationnel de priver l'intim\u00e9e de l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter sa demande.\n[17] Je ne me prononce pas sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la demande de non-lieu. Elle soul\u00e8ve n\u00e9anmoins des questions qui m\u00e9ritent un examen s\u00e9rieux. Je suis convaincu dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce qu'il n'existe aucun motif de demander \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de faire un choix avant d'entendre la demande de non-lieu.\nVI.

Introduction [1] M. Capp, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de non\u2011lieu. Il pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant a omis de produire quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au soutien des all\u00e9gations essentielles contenues dans la plainte.\n[2] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue deux motifs de discrimination. Le premier est l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. Le deuxi\u00e8me est l\u2019\u00e2ge. M. Filgueira affirme que Garfield le payait 1 $ de moins l\u2019heure qu\u2019elle payait d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. De plus, elle lui donnait moins d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 effectuer.\nII. Les questions pr\u00e9alables [3] Il existe deux questions pr\u00e9alables. La premi\u00e8re est celle de savoir si le plaignant a retir\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations au cours de son t\u00e9moignage. La deuxi\u00e8me est celle de savoir s\u2019il devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner de nouveau pour expliquer son t\u00e9moignage ant\u00e9rieur.\nA. La plainte a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e? [4] M. Capp a pr\u00e9tendu que le plaignant a retir\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations au cours du contre\u2011interrogatoire. \u00c0 un moment, M. Capp a interrog\u00e9 M. Filgueira comme suit :\n[Traduction] M. Capp : Et dans votre plainte, Monsieur, une partie de votre plainte \u00e9nonce que vous vous plaignez parce que la compagnie a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 votre endroit du fait de votre origine nationale ou ethnique, est\u2011ce exact?\nM. Filgueira : Je n\u2019ai pas dit cela. Il se peut que ce soit la raison ou c\u2019est parce que je ne parlais pas anglais.\nCette sorte d\u2019\u00e9change est typique.\n[5] M. Filgueira a essay\u00e9 de clarifier comme suit son t\u00e9moignage :\n[Traduction] M. Filgueira : Au d\u00e9part, c\u2019est ce que nous avons inscrit, mais ensuite nous avons pens\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment parce que je ne parlais pas anglais.\nIl a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] M. Filgueira : Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas certain si la discrimination \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que je suis Chilien ou sur le fait que je ne parlais pas anglais. Personne ne me l\u2019a dit.\nM\u00eame si M. Filgueira a r\u00e9pondu de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quivoque \u00e0 certaines des questions, cela n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019effet sur l\u2019essentiel de ces remarques.\n[6] Par la suite au cours de l\u2019interrogatoire, M. Capp a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] M. Capp : Et si quelqu\u2019un tentait d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il y a eu ou non de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le pays d\u2019origine ou sur l\u2019origine ethnique, vous et moi pouvons convenir que cela ne semble pas \u00eatre le cas quant \u00e0 Garfield Container Transport Inc., est\u2011ce exact?\nM. Filgueira : C\u2019est exact.\nCet \u00e9change est conforme au reste du contre\u2011interrogatoire. M. Filgueira a admis les points les uns apr\u00e8s les autres.\n[7] Le contre\u2011interrogatoire est devenu une poursuite. Lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait talonn\u00e9, M. Filgueira changeait sa position. M. Capp continuait. S\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du salaire, il y avait la question des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qui se posait. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires auxquelles il avait droit. M. Capp a \u00e9pluch\u00e9 les dossiers de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et a forc\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019il faisait. \u00c0 un moment, il reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il ne subissait pas de discrimination du fait de son \u00e2ge. \u00c0 un autre moment, il reconna\u00eet que la compagnie n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles contre lui. Ailleurs, il reconna\u00eet que d\u2019autres gardiens \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s un dollar de plus l\u2019heure parce qu\u2019ils v\u00e9rifiaient la temp\u00e9rature des conteneurs r\u00e9frig\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[8] On ne peut pas fuir la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 selon laquelle une grande partie du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant contredit la position qu\u2019il adopte en tant que partie \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cela dit, je pense que le Tribunal devrait agir de fa\u00e7on prudente dans cette sorte de situation. Apr\u00e8s tout, il appartient au plaignant de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il veut continuer l\u2019affaire ou retirer les all\u00e9gations. Il est clair que M. Filgueira continue \u00e0 soutenir les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte, peu importe son t\u00e9moignage. Dans les circonstances, je pense qu\u2019il serait simplement incorrect de dire qu\u2019il a abandonn\u00e9 sa poursuite.\nB. La facult\u00e9 auditive de M. Filgueira [9] Au cours de la pr\u00e9sentation de ses observations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de non\u2011lieu, Mme Rubio a en outre inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que M. Filgueira avait un probl\u00e8me auditif. Elle n\u2019avait pas constat\u00e9 ce probl\u00e8me jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait termin\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage. Ce probl\u00e8me expliquerait apparemment les passages dans lesquels il semble retirer ses all\u00e9gations. Mme Rubio a alors avanc\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e que M. Filgueira devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner de nouveau et \u00e0 expliquer son t\u00e9moignage ant\u00e9rieur.\n[10] M. Capp a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop tard pour soulever cette sorte de question. Je dois \u00eatre d\u2019accord avec lui. Si M. Filgueira avait un probl\u00e8me auditif, ce probl\u00e8me aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9vident lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Il semble plut\u00f4t commode de soulever ce probl\u00e8me maintenant, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il y a une demande visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte. Je pense que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Filgueira \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent et intelligible. Certaines de ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9taient \u00e9nigmatiques. Mais un t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est jamais parfait. La transcription ne soul\u00e8ve aucun doute s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa compr\u00e9hension des questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es. Il comprenait la diff\u00e9rence, par exemple, entre formation et initiation.\n[11] L\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle le plaignant devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve, et \u00e0 clarifier ses r\u00e9ponses ant\u00e9rieures est nouvelle pour moi. L\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus sont fond\u00e9es sur la compr\u00e9hension selon laquelle l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roulera dans un cadre ordonn\u00e9 et dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la fois. La loi est remplie d\u2019exceptions, mais tout le processus serait perturb\u00e9 si on permettait aux t\u00e9moins de revenir \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et de r\u00e9viser leur t\u00e9moignage. Ce serait une erreur que de laisser M. Filgueira t\u00e9moigner de nouveau.\nIII. La demande de non-lieu [12] Un tribunal qui tranche une demande de non\u2011lieu devrait se limiter \u00e0 la demande qui lui est soumise. Aux fins de la justice naturelle, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire que le tribunal \u00e9nonce des motifs ou renvoie d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on neutre \u00e0 la preuve dont il dispose. Il s\u2019agit toutefois d\u2019une autre sorte d\u2019analyse que l\u2019analyse effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une audience. Il n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 dans le contexte de la demande que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soient appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s ou que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire soit \u00e9valu\u00e9.\nA. Le droit [13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e m\u2019a fourni une d\u00e9cision qui traite express\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un non\u2011lieu dans un contexte administratif. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 348 c. AGT Ltd. [1997] A.J. no 1004 (B.R. Alb.), au paragraphe 15, le juge Brooker a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Je suis d\u2019avis que la commission doit appliquer correctement le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019absence de preuve \u00e0 une demande de non\u2011lieu. En agissant ainsi, sa t\u00e2che ne consiste pas \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la preuve. Sa t\u00e2che consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du point important en cause. La commission ne peut accueillir une demande de non\u2011lieu que si elle conclut qu\u2019il y a absence de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un ou de plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants du grief.\nCe crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le crit\u00e8re de quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[14] Il se r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli un deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de ce crit\u00e8re dans la d\u00e9cision Gerin c. I.M.P. Group Ltd. (No 1) (1994), 24 C.H.H.R. D\/449 (NS Bd. Inq.), au paragraphe 24, dans laquelle Bruce Wildsmith a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] [\u2026] le crit\u00e8re de quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019est probablement pas assez \u00e9lev\u00e9; il doit y avoir un certain fondement raisonnable permettant de tirer une conclusion favorable au plaignant.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re soutient par cons\u00e9quent qu\u2019il doit y avoir de la preuve sur laquelle un tribunal pourrait se fonder pour tirer une conclusion favorable au plaignant.\n[15] David Mullan suit l\u2019exemple de M. Wildsmith dans la d\u00e9cision Modi c. Paradise Fine Foods Ltd., 2005 HRTO 24, au paragraphe 13, et applique le deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re. Cela est conforme aux commentaires du juge MacIntyre dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons\u2011Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28, dans lequel il a d\u00e9crit la preuve prima facie comme :\n[\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la diff\u00e9rence entre les deux crit\u00e8res est facilement exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[16] La d\u00e9cision Gerin mentionne une vieille affaire anglaise, Ryder v. Wombwell (1868) L.R. 4 Exch. 32, aux pages 38 et 39, qui \u00e9nonce le crit\u00e8re d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui semble particuli\u00e8rement utile dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[Traduction] [I]l y a dans toute affaire [\u2026] une question pr\u00e9alable qui est une question de droit, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celle de savoir s\u2019il y a quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sur lequel le jury pourrait correctement se fonder pour tirer une conclusion favorable \u00e0 la partie qui a le fardeau de preuve. S\u2019il n\u2019y en a pas, le juge doit retirer l\u2019affaire au jury et ordonner un non-lieu [\u2026].\n[17] Le point que je souhaite faire valoir est que l\u2019utilisation des mots quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve dans le contexte d\u2019un non\u2011lieu a certaines limites. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la poursuite doit satisfaire \u00e0 une certaine norme. Il doit s\u2019agir de preuve sur laquelle on peut se fonder. Je remarque que le juge MacIntyre \u00e9crit qu\u2019une preuve prima facie doit \u00eatre suffisante. Je pense que la preuve doit de plus \u00eatre appr\u00e9ciable. Il y a un seuil sous lequel la valeur probante de la preuve est si minimale qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas d\u2019effet juridique.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations (i) L\u2019\u00e2ge [18] Le plaignant fait deux all\u00e9gations. L\u2019une est qu\u2019il a subi de la discrimination du fait de son \u00e2ge.\n[19] Il y a une absence de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La seule preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e2ge est que M. Filgueira \u00e9tait plus \u00e2g\u00e9 que les autres employ\u00e9s. Je dispose en outre de preuve selon laquelle il se peut qu\u2019un autre veilleur de nuit ait re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est pas suffisant.\n[20] Je suis conscient que la jurisprudence sugg\u00e8re que le simple fait qu\u2019un plaignant dans un groupe particulier ait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente est suffisant pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Je pense que cette interpr\u00e9tation du droit enl\u00e8verait probablement au processus toute exigence significative. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Filgueira \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 le plus \u00e2g\u00e9, quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019un autre employ\u00e9 recevait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e conduirait \u00e0 une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination. Je pense qu\u2019il doit y avoir quelque chose de plus. Il doit y avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9. Il doit y avoir de la preuve d\u00e9montrant que la diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un motif prohib\u00e9.\n(ii) L\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique [21] L\u2019autre all\u00e9gation dans la plainte est que M. Filgueira a subi de la discrimination du fait de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Il existe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce deux all\u00e9gations quant aux faits. La premi\u00e8re se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle des salaires et la deuxi\u00e8me aux heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\na) L\u2019\u00e9chelle des salaires [22] M. Filgueira \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit comme un veilleur de nuit. M. Capp disait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un [Traduction] gardien. Il y avait des gardiens de nuit et des gardiens de jour. M. Filgueira a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 moins que l\u2019\u00e9taient d\u2019autres gardiens.\n[23] Il existe une question de preuve qui exige une observation. Mme Rubio s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur un seul relev\u00e9 de salaires qui contenait des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 des talons de ch\u00e8que de paie pour M. Filgueira et pour de nombreux autres employ\u00e9s. Les portions de ce document qui se rapportent \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. Je n\u2019ai aucun renseignement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces employ\u00e9s, de leurs fonctions ou des raisons pour lesquelles ils \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s. Les portions de ce document se rapportant \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s n\u2019ont aucune importance que ce soit.\n[24] Le principal probl\u00e8me auquel se heurte M. Filgueira \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du non\u2011lieu est qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve pour \u00e9tablir quelle \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9chelle des salaires des gardiens. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011ci, je ne sais simplement pas quelle \u00e9tait la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des autres gardiens. Il y a le t\u00e9moignage de M. Beaudoin, mais ce dernier avait des fonctions additionnelles. Point plus pertinent encore, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un veilleur de nuit. M. Beaudoin travaillait le jour et la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la charge de travail \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e le jour.\n[25] Le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui aurait pu conduire \u00e0 une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination provient du plaignant lui\u2011m\u00eame. M. Filgueira a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Pahar, un autre veilleur de nuit, affirmait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 un dollar de plus l\u2019heure. M. Pahar \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, mais il n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Mme Rubio a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas insister pour qu\u2019il comparaisse. Je n\u2019ai donc que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Filgueira.\n[26] Le t\u00e9moignage n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas que M. Pahar recevait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des m\u00eames fonctions. M. Filgueira a reconnu, lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, que d\u2019autres gardiens au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e recevaient une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e parce qu\u2019ils enregistraient la temp\u00e9rature des conteneurs r\u00e9frig\u00e9r\u00e9s. M. Filgueira n\u2019ex\u00e9cutait pas cette fonction. La question \u00e9vidente est celle de savoir si M. Pahar enregistrait la temp\u00e9rature des conteneurs r\u00e9frig\u00e9r\u00e9s. La preuve ne nous le dit pas.\n[27] Il est vrai que M. Filgueira a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a form\u00e9 M. Pahar. Ce fait peut sans doute \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une preuve qu\u2019ils ex\u00e9cutaient les m\u00eames fonctions. Toutefois, il y a encore des lacunes dans le dossier. La preuve \u00e9tablit que M. Pahar \u00e9tait un Est\u2011Indien et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une minorit\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit que la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son salaire n\u2019appuie pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle Garfield a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Filgueira parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 ethnique.\n[28] Je suppose qu\u2019on pourrait toujours pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019employeur a trait\u00e9 M. Filgueira, un Chilien, d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle selon laquelle il traitait les employ\u00e9s provenant de l\u2019Inde. Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que M. Jasbir, le g\u00e9rant de triage, ait engag\u00e9 des gens en provenance de son pays. Toutefois, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se. Il n\u2019y a pas de preuve que M. Pahar recevait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e en raison de son appartenance \u00e0 un groupe ethnique particulier. Le manque total de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pratiques de l\u2019employeur fait qu\u2019il est impossible de dire pourquoi des salaires diff\u00e9rents peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s.\nb) Les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires [29] M. Filgueira a en outre all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Garfield a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit quant aux heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il y a deux pr\u00e9tentions distinctes. La premi\u00e8re est que Garfield ne lui a pas pay\u00e9 les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es avant 2001. La deuxi\u00e8me est qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9duit ses heures suppl\u00e9mentaires compte tenu de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n1. Avant 2001\n[30] La premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention requiert une certaine explication des faits. Lorsque M. Filgueira a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par Garfield, il travaillait 72 heures par semaine. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019il faisait. Cette situation a finalement conduit \u00e0 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de Travail Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du d\u00e9faut de la compagnie de payer les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es.\n[31] La plainte aupr\u00e8s de Travail Canada a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Il y a une lettre d\u2019un inspecteur du travail. Cette lettre est dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2001 et \u00e9nonce que M. Filgueira a droit \u00e0 une somme de 13 104,00 $ pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es.\n[32] Le dernier paragraphe de la lettre \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 251(2) [du Code canadien du travail], veuillez indiquer en signant ci\u2011apr\u00e8s que le montant pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il sera vers\u00e9 \u00e0 votre RE\u00c9R, est le montant total qui vous est d\u00fb pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires que vous avez effectu\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant.\nCe paragraphe est suivi d\u2019une ligne pour la signature.\n[33] Il n\u2019y a pas de raison pour aller plus en d\u00e9tail quant \u00e0 la question. Le paragraphe 251(2) du Code canadien du travail \u00e9nonce que l\u2019employeur et l\u2019employ\u00e9 doivent s\u2019entendre sur le montant d\u00fb. M. Filgueira a accept\u00e9 le montant mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre \u00e0 titre de paiement complet pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es. Mme Rubio a reconnu au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience que la r\u00e9clamation mon\u00e9taire pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es avant 2001 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Elle a n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9tendu que le d\u00e9faut de la compagnie de payer les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es \u00e9tait une preuve de discrimination.\n[34] Le probl\u00e8me est qu\u2019il y a absence de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9tention voulant que le d\u00e9faut de payer les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires constitue une pratique discriminatoire au sens l\u00e9gal. La seule preuve dont je disposais \u00e9tait que M. Filgueira a eu une conversation avec un dirigeant de la compagnie qui lui avait dit que la compagnie ne payait pas les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es. Il n\u2019y a toutefois pas de v\u00e9ritables renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. Il n\u2019y a rien dans la preuve qui d\u00e9montrerait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a trait\u00e9 M. Filgueira d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle selon laquelle elle traitait des employ\u00e9s d\u2019autres groupes nationaux ou ethniques.\n2. Les repr\u00e9sailles\n[35] Le plaignant a en outre all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir subi des repr\u00e9sailles. Il y a deux versions de cette all\u00e9gation. La premi\u00e8re est que la compagnie a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Filgueira parce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu du Code canadien du travail. La deuxi\u00e8me est qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit parce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[36] L\u2019affirmation fondamentale quant aux faits est que les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es par M. Filgueira ont diminu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la demande ant\u00e9rieure eut \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Il y a absence de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. M. Capp a \u00e9pluch\u00e9 laborieusement le dossier de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Filgueira, ch\u00e8que de paie par ch\u00e8que de paie. M. Filgueira a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 80 heures par semaine en 2001, 2002 et 2003. C\u2019\u00e9tait le nombre d\u2019heures qu\u2019il travaillait avant que la plainte soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[37] Je dois ajouter que les renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s sont compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9ficients. Il n\u2019y a pas de preuve d\u00e9montrant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a trait\u00e9 M. Filgueira d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle selon laquelle elle traitait des employ\u00e9s d\u2019autres groupes nationaux ou ethniques.\nc) Conclusions [38] L\u2019exigence fondamentale quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire est relativement simple. Le plaignant doit pr\u00e9senter une certaine preuve d\u00e9montrant que Garfield l\u2019a trait\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle selon laquelle elle traitait des employ\u00e9s d\u2019autres groupes nationaux ou ethniques. L\u2019affaire s\u2019est compliqu\u00e9e compte tenu du fait que M. Filgueira a modifi\u00e9 sa position au cours de son t\u00e9moignage et a laiss\u00e9 entendre que le v\u00e9ritable fondement de toute discrimination \u00e9tait la langue. Je reconnais n\u00e9anmoins dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire que cette question serait suffisante pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019origine nationale.\n[39] Je pense que les \u00e9changes lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire d\u00e9montrent la nature hypoth\u00e9tique de la pr\u00e9tention qui m\u2019est soumise. M. Filgueira croyait qu\u2019il recevait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moindre que celle re\u00e7ue par d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. Compte tenu de ce fait, il a tenu pour acquis qu\u2019il faisait l\u2019objet de discrimination. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se. M. Filgueira n\u2019\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au motif pour lequel il \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. Mais, naturellement, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui pr\u00e9occupe le Tribunal.\n[40] La seule preuve dont je dispose est la remarque de M. Pahar selon laquelle il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 un dollar de plus l\u2019heure. La remarque a contrari\u00e9 M. Filgueira et il a tenu pour acquis qu\u2019il faisait l\u2019objet de discrimination. Je suppose que cela est possible. Mais il doit y avoir une certaine preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En droit, lorsque l\u2019on dit preuve, nous voulons dire quelque chose qui fait qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019une pr\u00e9tention particuli\u00e8re soit vraie qu\u2019il est probable qu\u2019elle ne le soit pas. Il doit y avoir quelque chose dans la preuve qui appuierait une conclusion favorable au plaignant.\n[41] La question qui demeure est la suivante : Le fait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 croit qu\u2019une personne d\u2019un groupe ethnique diff\u00e9rent fait le m\u00eame travail et re\u00e7oit un salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 est\u2011il suffisant pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination? Je pense qu\u2019il doit y avoir quelque chose de plus. Il doit y avoir quelque chose dans la preuve, ind\u00e9pendamment de ce que le plaignant croit, qui confirme ses soup\u00e7ons. Je ne dis pas que ce que croit un plaignant n\u2019a aucune force probante. Cela d\u00e9pend des circonstances. Toutefois, le fait de croire abstraitement qu\u2019une personne fait l\u2019objet de discrimination, sans qu\u2019il existe un certain fait qui le confirme, n\u2019est pas suffisant.\n[42] Il y a toujours des possibilit\u00e9s. Ce n\u2019est pas suffisant. Une preuve est quelque chose de plus qu\u2019une simple possibilit\u00e9. Je ne vois rien dans la preuve dont je dispose qui rend r\u00e9elle cette possibilit\u00e9 ou qui apporte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quation un degr\u00e9 mesurable de possibilit\u00e9.\n[43] Je n\u2019ai donc qu\u2019une seule d\u00e9claration de M. Pahar, qui n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin. Je pense que cette preuve se situe bien au-dessous de la norme requise pour faire droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation qui serait fond\u00e9e en droit. Si quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, il n\u2019est pas appr\u00e9ciable. Il est si minimal qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas d\u2019effet juridique.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [44] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un non\u2011lieu a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait.

Paul Groarke\n[1] M. Bagambiire reprsente le plaignant. Il a demand une ordonnance formelle prvoyant le paiement par l'intim des dpens que j'ai adjugs dans ma dcision antrieure. L'intim s'y est oppos.\n[2] L'article 57 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne prvoit ce qui suit :\n57. Aux fins de leur excution, les ordonnances rendues en vertu des articles 53 et 54 peuvent, selon la procdure habituelle ou ds que la Commission en dpose au greffe de la Cour fdrale une copie certifie conforme, tre assimiles aux ordonnances rendues par celle-ci.\n[3] Je suis conscient que les articles 53 et 54 ne mentionnent pas expressment les dpens. Il ne m'apparat pas que cela a de l'importance. La manire habituelle de faire excuter une dcision du Tribunal est de prparer une ordonnance formelle qui peut tre dpose la Cour fdrale.\n[4] Je partage l'opinion de M. Bagambiire selon laquelle la dlivrance d'une ordonnance formelle est un acte administratif qui relve probablement de tout organisme qui a un pouvoir dcisionnel. Le seul motif justifiant une telle ordonnance est de fournir un rsum pratique des conditions de l'adjudication. L'ordonnance fournit une directive claire aux fonctionnaires chargs de l'excution de l'adjudication.\n[5] Cependant, M. Bagambiire va plus loin et prtend que le plaignant a un droit fond sur la common law d'obtenir une telle ordonnance, sous rserve de toutes oppositions quant sa forme et son contenu. Je suis enclin partager son opinion. L'ordonnance n'ajoute rien ma dcision antrieure et ne fait que dclarer qu'une certaine dcision a t rendue. Il serait arbitraire d'accorder au plaignant une rparation et de refuser ensuite de lui remettre les documents dont il a besoin pour l'obtenir.\n[6] Cependant, il existe une autre question. Mme Cameron reprsente l'intim. Elle a confirm que l'intim demande un contrle de ma dcision antrieure selon laquelle le Tribunal a comptence pour adjuger des dpens. Il se rvle que la mme question est actuellement soumise la Cour fdrale dans une autre affaire. Mme Cameron affirme que la situation est incertaine. Elle n'est pas l'aise l'ide que le plaignant tente de faire excuter une ordonnance formelle alors qu'il y a une contestation l'gard de ma comptence de rendre cette ordonnance.\n[7] Je partage l'opinion de l'intim selon laquelle il serait prfrable de voir ce que la Cour fdrale dcide avant que le plaignant tente de faire excuter l'ordonnance. Cela dit, je suis arriv la conclusion que cet aspect de l'affaire ne dpend pas de moi. Il m'apparat que M. Bagambiire a raison lorsqu'il dit que j'ai une obligation de suivre ma dcision, et de demeurer inbranlable, jusqu' ce que la Cour fdrale rende une dcision contraire. Je commettrais une volte-face si je refusais de rendre l'ordonnance demande.\n[8] L'ordonnance sera donc rendue.\nM.

Grant Sinclair, pr\u00e9sident\nPierre Deschamps, membre\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien\ndes droits de la personne\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est la plus r\u00e9cente d'une s\u00e9rie de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Bell en vue d'obtenir la production et la divulgation de documents.\n[2] Dans leur demande de redressement, les plaignants, CEP et Femmes-Action, r\u00e9clament 1 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, pour pr\u00e9judice moral subi par chaque personne ayant occup\u00e9 un poste dans une cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine de CEP, entre le 11 f\u00e9vrier 1990 (ou la date de d\u00e9but d'emploi si cette date est post\u00e9rieure) et la date de la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive du Tribunal. CEP et Femmes-Action pr\u00e9tendent que ces personnes ont subi un pr\u00e9judice moral en raison de l'omission de Bell d'avoir mis en uvre l'\u00e9tude conjointe sur la parit\u00e9 salariale et de son omission d'avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des ajustements de salaires.\n[3] Afin de prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses pr\u00e9tentions, CEP appellera \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moins six ou sept t\u00e9l\u00e9phonistes ayant travaill\u00e9 chez Bell. Ces t\u00e9moins fourniront une preuve de nature repr\u00e9sentative \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi, des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, du stress et \u00e0 de la frustration caus\u00e9s \u00e0 eux et \u00e0 d'autres membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation et, dans certains cas, de leurs familles.\n[4] La demande de divulgation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Bell est exceptionnelle dans son \u00e9tendue. Bell demande que ces t\u00e9moins et leurs \u00e9poux ou conjoints fournissent des documents \u00e0 jour indiquant leurs revenus, d\u00e9penses, actifs et dettes, pour la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9tendant du 11 f\u00e9vrier 1990 jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant. Bell demande plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment :\ndes d\u00e9clarations de revenus; des ententes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cartes de cr\u00e9dit, de pr\u00eats, de marges de cr\u00e9dit et d'autres sources de financement utilis\u00e9 ou disponible, et des relev\u00e9s mensuels et annuels s'y rapportant; tout document indiquant les dates de naissance et de retraite, de mariages, de cohabitations, de s\u00e9parations, de divorces, de naissance de tout enfant, et indiquant toute transaction, entente ou ordonnance d'une cour \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du partage des revenus, frais d'entretien, d\u00e9penses, actifs et dettes, comme une pension alimentaire vers\u00e9e pour un enfant ou un \u00e9poux; tout relev\u00e9 financier pr\u00e9par\u00e9 aux fins d'une demande de financement, personnel ou autre; des documents indiquant toute autre question ou circonstance ayant un effet important sur la situation financi\u00e8re de chaque t\u00e9moin ou s'y rapportant, y compris mais sans s'y limiter, une maladie grave, un accident, un incendie, un choix de destinations de vacances et d'autres voyages personnels.\n[5] Bell pr\u00e9tend que les documents sont sans doute pertinents et requis pour comprendre la situation financi\u00e8re de chaque t\u00e9moin au cours de la p\u00e9riode en cause, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'elle puisse mener un contre-interrogatoire appropri\u00e9.\n[6] Bell veut en outre utiliser la situation financi\u00e8re des t\u00e9moins de CEP pour contester l'opinion d'expert de M. Gould quant au taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat applicable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute indemnit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re que le Tribunal peut accorder.\n[7] CEP s'oppose \u00e0 la divulgation et la production de ces documents parce qu'ils ne sont sans doute pas pertinents, parce qu'ils sont une intrusion inutile dans la vie priv\u00e9e des t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s et parce que ces documents ou dossiers font l'objet d'un privil\u00e8ge et sont confidentiels. La Commission n'adopte aucune position quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Bell.\n[8] En plus de sa pr\u00e9tention quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, Bell pr\u00e9sente en outre le r\u00e9cent arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Smith & Nephew Inc. c. Glegg, 2005 CSC 31, au soutien de ses demandes.\n[9] L'arr\u00eat Glegg ne traitait pas de la divulgation d'information financi\u00e8re. Il traitait de la divulgation de dossiers m\u00e9dicaux d'un psychiatre. Au cours de l'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable, la plaignante a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'elle avait consult\u00e9 un psychiatre \u00e0 environ 40 reprises. Les d\u00e9fendeurs pr\u00e9tendaient que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du psychiatre \u00e9taient pertinents et n\u00e9cessaires pour une d\u00e9fense pleine et appropri\u00e9e. Ils demandaient la production des dossiers. La plaignante s'y opposait.\n[10] Dans ses motifs, la Cour supr\u00eame a accord\u00e9 une attention particuli\u00e8re aux dispositions du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec et \u00e0 la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec. Cet aspect de ses motifs n'est pas pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[11] Ce qui est pertinent c'est la portion de l'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame intitul\u00e9e L'exigence de la pertinence. \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de la pertinence, la Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9 qu'un d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u00e9montrer non pas que la preuve est pertinente au sens traditionnel du mot, mais que la divulgation du document sera utile, est appropri\u00e9e, est susceptible de faire progresser le d\u00e9bat et repose sur un objectif acceptable qu'il cherche \u00e0 atteindre dans le dossier, et que le document se rapporte au litige (au paragraphe 23).\n[12] Comme nous avons mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la demande de Bell va excessivement trop loin. Par exemple, Bell demande au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 des tiers, c'est-\u00e0-dire aux \u00e9poux ou conjoints, de produire certains documents. Le Tribunal n'a aucune comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une telle ordonnance.\n[13] En outre, la requ\u00eate de Bell exige que les t\u00e9moins, les \u00e9poux ou les conjoints cr\u00e9ent des documents qui n'existent pas. Le Tribunal ne peut pas exiger cela.\n[14] Un autre exemple que Bell va trop loin est sa demande visant \u00e0 ce que les t\u00e9moins produisent des documents indiquant toute autre question ou circonstance ayant un effet important sur la situation financi\u00e8re de chaque t\u00e9moin ou s'y rapportant. Cette demande constitue ce qui \u00e9quivaut au proverbial interrogatoire \u00e0 l'aveuglette. Elle n'est pas pr\u00e9cise et elle exige que les t\u00e9moins d\u00e9cident quels documents des quinze derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ont eu un effet important sur leur situation financi\u00e8re.\n[15] La question \u00e0 trancher par le Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du pr\u00e9judice moral comporte deux volets. Premi\u00e8rement, celui de savoir si les plaignants ont subi un pr\u00e9judice moral en raison du refus de Bell de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des ajustements de salaires et, deuxi\u00e8mement, dans l'affirmative, celui de savoir quel montant devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de dommages.\n[16] Dans leurs d\u00e9clarations anticip\u00e9es, les t\u00e9moins de CEP pr\u00e9tendent que le refus de Bell de r\u00e9gler compl\u00e8tement l'\u00e9cart de salaires a eu un impact d\u00e9favorable sur leur situation financi\u00e8re. Ce refus a eu certaines cons\u00e9quences. Par exemple, certains ne pouvaient pas joindre les deux bouts, certains ne pouvaient pas offrir \u00e0 leurs enfants des activit\u00e9s comme le hockey ou des cours de danse, certains ont d\u00fb, pour payer les frais d'\u00e9ducation de leurs enfants, encaisser des placements dans leur RE\u00c9R, certains n'ont pas pu payer les soins d'orthodontie de leurs enfants, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont subi un pr\u00e9judice moral atteignant 1 000 $ par t\u00e9moin, par ann\u00e9e, pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es.\n[17] Les plaignants, en pr\u00e9sentant cette demande d'indemnit\u00e9, ne demandent pas une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte financi\u00e8re. Plut\u00f4t, ils pr\u00e9tendent que les difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res all\u00e9gu\u00e9es ont caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral aux t\u00e9moins.\n[18] Il appartient aux plaignants d'\u00e9tablir un lien \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 Bell de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9tention. \u00c0 notre avis, les documents et dossiers demand\u00e9s par Bell ne seraient pas utiles ou ne feraient pas progresser le d\u00e9bat devant le Tribunal. C'est plut\u00f4t le contre-interrogatoire de ces t\u00e9moins asserment\u00e9s qui fournirait au Tribunal un fondement probatoire plus utile pour trancher la question de savoir si les t\u00e9moins ont effectivement subi un pr\u00e9judice moral et, dans l'affirmative, pour d\u00e9cider quel montant serait appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9.\n[19] Quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de Bell selon laquelle elle a besoin de ces documents et dossiers pour traiter de l'opinion d'expert de M. Gould, le Tribunal mentionne que la preuve de M. Gould portait essentiellement sur la question du taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat applicable \u00e0 toute indemnit\u00e9 que le Tribunal peut accorder.\n[20] La preuve de M. Gould \u00e9tait de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il n'a examin\u00e9 la situation financi\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re d'aucun membre de CEP. En fait, il a \u00e9mis l'avis que la situation financi\u00e8re individuelle des membres de CEP n'\u00e9tait pas pertinente.\n[21] Il n'\u00e9tait pas important pour M. Gould de savoir o\u00f9 vivait chacun des plaignants, quel \u00e9tait leur niveau d'endettement, quelles \u00e9taient leurs habitudes de consommation, quelle \u00e9tait leur situation familiale, etc.\n[22] Compte tenu de l'information financi\u00e8re dont il disposait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du groupe, \u00e0 savoir le fait que les individus recevaient une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle variant de 27 000 $ \u00e0 32 000 $, M. Gould pouvait conclure que les membres, en tant que groupe, avaient tous certaines dettes.\n[23] La conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de M. Gould selon laquelle les membres de CEP, des t\u00e9l\u00e9phonistes de Bell, avaient des pr\u00eats hypoth\u00e9caires, des pr\u00eats personnels ou des cartes de cr\u00e9dit peut \u00eatre facilement v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e par un contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de CEP.\n[24] En outre, la validit\u00e9 de toute hypoth\u00e8se ou conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale tir\u00e9e par M. Gould, plut\u00f4t que la situation particuli\u00e8re, peut \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e par une opinion d'expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Bell.\n[25] La requ\u00eate de Bell est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Introduction [1] Le 31 ao\u00fbt 2002, Benjamin Schecter (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Il pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par son omission d\u2019avoir offert aux membres de sa famille et \u00e0 lui\u2011m\u00eame une accommodation quant \u00e0 ses installations, s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre une affaire tr\u00e8s simple s\u2019est malheureusement transform\u00e9 en une audience conflictuelle et parfois agressive. L\u2019hostilit\u00e9 et la m\u00e9fiance enracin\u00e9e des parties l\u2019une envers l\u2019autre \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s manifestes et rendaient difficile, voire impossible, toute d\u00e9marche logique visant \u00e0 trouver une solution. Par contre, durant toute l\u2019audience, le plaignant, Benjamin Schecter, au cours de la portion de l\u2019audience \u00e0 laquelle il a particip\u00e9, et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. William G. McMurray, ont agi de mani\u00e8re respectueuse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Tribunal et des autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[3] Les interruptions et les perturbations au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e9taient principalement dues au fils du plaignant, le t\u00e9moin, M. Marshall Schecter. \u00c0 de nombreuses reprises, il a manifest\u00e9 un manque de respect \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Tribunal et il a contest\u00e9 ses directives. Il n\u2019a pas pris \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re les arguments ou opinions qui diff\u00e9raient de ce qu\u2019il estimait \u00eatre les faits ou le droit. Je vais, dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, exposer en d\u00e9tail et commenter les circonstances qui ont en fin de compte amen\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 quitter l\u2019audience \u00e0 la demande insistante de son fils. L\u2019attitude de Marshall Schecter n\u2019a certainement pas aid\u00e9 la cause du plaignant et l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer et de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019une mani\u00e8re logique et raisonnable les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 devant le Tribunal.\n[4] Le plaignant, Benjamin Schecter, est un conseil de la Reine et un membre du Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec. Il est \u00e9galement un juge \u00e0 la retraite de la chambre criminelle de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec. De plus, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre instructeur du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pendant dix ans et il a pris sa retraite quelques mois avant la pr\u00e9sente audience. Je n\u2019avais jamais rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant avant la pr\u00e9sente audience et je n\u2019ai pas non plus appris avant d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 pour entendre l\u2019affaire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un ancien membre instructeur du Tribunal.\n[5] La participation de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e. Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, M. Patrick O\u2019Rourke, avocat de la Commission, a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que la Commission avait conclu une entente avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui r\u00e9glerait, \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Commission, les questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Commission ne voyait pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience et elle a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son intention de se retirer de l\u2019instance.\nII. Les questions pr\u00e9alables [6] D\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 certaines questions pr\u00e9liminaires. J\u2019ai trait\u00e9 de ces questions de vive voix au cours de l\u2019audience. Le plaignant a en outre soulev\u00e9 une question se rapportant \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre aux t\u00e9moins. Je vais maintenant traiter officiellement de ces questions.\n[7] Dans une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demandait une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on sommaire. Les motifs de cette demande comportaient trois volets, \u00e0 savoir : le plaignant n\u2019avait pas adh\u00e9r\u00e9 au processus de divulgation du Tribunal, la question de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e et les faits expos\u00e9s dans la plainte ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient aucune question devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[8] Il serait appropri\u00e9, afin de trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, d\u2019examiner certains \u00e9changes de correspondance entre les parties, la Commission et le Tribunal.\n[9] La pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a demand\u00e9, suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, le 6 janvier 2004, que le pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire, selon son titre d\u2019alors, du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, instruise la plainte \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait convaincue, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 qu\u2019une instruction ait lieu.\n[10] Le 27 janvier 2004, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que les documents divulgu\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au plaignant et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties, le 18 mars 2004, que l\u2019affaire serait instruite et qu\u2019elles avaient le droit de pr\u00e9senter devant le Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations de droit au soutien de leurs pr\u00e9tentions. Les parties ont \u00e9galement re\u00e7u des photocopies de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal r\u00e9gissant sa pratique, une publication du Tribunal intitul\u00e9 Comment s\u2019y retrouver? Guide de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et un questionnaire visant \u00e0 aider le Tribunal \u00e0 planifier l\u2019instruction. On a demand\u00e9 aux parties de r\u00e9pondre par \u00e9crit au questionnaire et d\u2019envoyer un exemplaire du questionnaire rempli aux autres parties et au Tribunal au plus tard le 8 avril 2004.\n[11] Le 19 avril 2004, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur le questionnaire rempli par le plaignant. Dans la section intitul\u00e9e [Traduction] R\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es, le plaignant a \u00e9crit [Traduction] Obliger principalement \u00e0 fournir aux personnes handicap\u00e9es une aire de stationnement appropri\u00e9e dans ses gares, notamment \u00e0 la Gare centrale de Montr\u00e9al. Plus bas \u00e0 la section 5 du questionnaire, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la main [Traduction] Dommages \u00e0 prendre en compte. Le questionnaire rempli par l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 26 avril 2004.\n[12] Le Tribunal, compte tenu des r\u00e9ponses au questionnaire, a donn\u00e9 le 2 juin 2004 des directives se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du calendrier pour l\u2019instruction et la divulgation. Il a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de fournir aux parties un exemplaire de son dossier au plus tard le 22 juin 2004. Suivant le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission de faire une divulgation compl\u00e8te au plus tard le 16 juillet 2004 et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de faire sa divulgation au plus tard le 10 ao\u00fbt 2004. De plus, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au courant du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles qui explique que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation du [membre instructeur qui pr\u00e9side l\u2019audience] [\u2026] et sous r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019une partie de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en r\u00e9plique, une question qui n\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e ou un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 ne doivent pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audience.\n[13] Les parties ont de plus \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es que la divulgation inclut leurs \u00e9changes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la preuve documentaire et les listes de t\u00e9moins comprenant pour chacun d\u2019eux l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il va dire. Il a de plus \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 que la divulgation consiste non seulement en des documents qu\u2019une partie a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter en preuve lors de l\u2019audience, mais \u00e9galement en des documents dont la pertinence peut \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019instance, qu\u2019une partie ait l\u2019intention ou non de les d\u00e9poser en preuve.\n[14] Le Tribunal a de plus donn\u00e9 aux parties la directive de fournir par \u00e9crit de br\u00e8ves pr\u00e9cisions pour exposer les questions en litige et la preuve qu\u2019elles lui pr\u00e9senteraient. Ces pr\u00e9cisions devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal et des photocopies devaient \u00eatre remises \u00e0 toutes les parties au plus tard aux dates fix\u00e9es.\n[15] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2004, le plaignant a transmis au Tribunal une lettre dans laquelle il nommait cinq t\u00e9moins \u00e9ventuels, mais il n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacun des t\u00e9moins l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il va dire. Cette liste de t\u00e9moins n\u2019incluait pas le plaignant, son \u00e9pouse ou son fils, Marshall Schecter. \u00c0 la page 2 de la lettre, le plaignant \u00e9num\u00e9rait les r\u00e9parations et les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires qu\u2019il solliciterait lors de l\u2019audience.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit au Tribunal le 17 ao\u00fbt 2004. Elle renvoyait \u00e0 la lettre du plaignant dat\u00e9e du 13 ao\u00fbt 2004 et d\u00e9clarait que cette lettre ne [Traduction] constituait pas une divulgation appropri\u00e9e, puis elle \u00e9num\u00e9rait une s\u00e9rie de questions qu\u2019elle voulait voir traiter. Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2004, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a signifi\u00e9 aux autres parties sa liste de t\u00e9moins \u00e9ventuels et de documents.\n[17] Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2004, M. Marshall Schecter, le fils du plaignant, a envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal une lettre par laquelle il s\u2019opposait \u00e0 la production de certains documents contenus dans la liste de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a en outre fourni des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des r\u00e9parations compensatoires que le plaignant solliciterait lors de l\u2019audience et la liste de ses t\u00e9moins. Il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que le plaignant appellerait son \u00e9pouse et son fils \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moins lors de l\u2019audience.\n[18] Je vais maintenant traiter s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de chacune des questions soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Je vais d\u2019abord traiter des questions se rapportant aux t\u00e9moins et \u00e0 la divulgation de documents. Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, une partie doit non seulement indiquer les noms des divers t\u00e9moins qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer, mais elle doit \u00e9galement fournir dans sa divulgation un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de chacun d\u2019eux. Le plaignant n\u2019a jamais fourni un tel r\u00e9sum\u00e9 quant aux t\u00e9moins qu\u2019il a indiqu\u00e9s dans sa lettre du 13 ao\u00fbt 2004. Dans sa lettre du 23 ao\u00fbt 2004, le plaignant a avanc\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de citer son \u00e9pouse et son fils comme t\u00e9moins, mais il n\u2019a pas fourni des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de leurs t\u00e9moignages.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne devait pas \u00eatre surprise que ces deux t\u00e9moins soient cit\u00e9s par le plaignant compte tenu de leurs liens \u00e9troits avec les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. M\u00eame si un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fourni, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon l\u2019information qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait, \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitivement en mesure de s\u2019attendre au contenu de leur t\u00e9moignage. Le but d\u2019un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de ce que le t\u00e9moin va dire est d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019autre partie d\u2019\u00eatre prise au d\u00e9pourvu lorsque l\u2019audience d\u00e9bute. Je crois que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la situation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces deux t\u00e9moins et, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e du fait de l\u2019absence de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019objection \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e.\n[20] Quant aux autres t\u00e9moins indiqu\u00e9s par le plaignant, aucun r\u00e9sum\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni pour eux. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 des assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour ces t\u00e9moins. Suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi, seuls les t\u00e9moins dont les t\u00e9moignages sont jug\u00e9s indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte recevront une assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et seront contraints de compara\u00eetre lors de l\u2019audience de la plainte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019on va dire pour ces t\u00e9moins ni aucune explication raisonnable pour l\u2019omission d\u2019avoir respect\u00e9 les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer la pertinence de la preuve propos\u00e9e.\n[21] Il est \u00e9galement important de comprendre que la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas un acte administratif. Le Tribunal a un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que le membre a le pouvoir d\u2019assigner un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre s\u2019il juge que cela est indispensable \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte (ACET c. Bell Canada, T503\/2098, d\u00e9cision no 2). Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que je ne suis pas en mesure de juger si cela \u00e9tait indispensable, j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer les assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Je dois ajouter qu\u2019une audience devant le Tribunal n\u2019est pas un interrogatoire \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette et que, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il existe un lien pertinent entre la preuve que l\u2019on tente d\u2019obtenir des t\u00e9moins pour lesquels des assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre sont requises et l\u2019affaire soumise au Tribunal, les assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ne seront pas d\u00e9livr\u00e9es.\n[22] Je vais maintenant traiter de la question se rapportant \u00e0 la divulgation de documents. Les principales obligations du Tribunal en ce qui touche la divulgation reposent sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus. Cela exige g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une divulgation pleine et enti\u00e8re par les parties. Toute exception devrait \u00eatre vue comme une r\u00e9serve tir\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[23] Suivant le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, un plaignant qui a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter une preuve ou qui souhaite adopter une position qui diff\u00e8re de celle de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne doit fournir par \u00e9crit :\nLes faits pertinents qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause. Les questions de droit soulev\u00e9es dans la cause, y compris la nature de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Le redressement qu\u2019il recherche. Les documents qu\u2019il a en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en litige dans l\u2019affaire et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Les documents qu\u2019il a en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en litige et pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge est invoqu\u00e9, y compris les motifs de la demande. Les noms de t\u00e9moins qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de citer, y compris les t\u00e9moins experts ainsi identifi\u00e9s, et un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leurs t\u00e9moignages.\n[24] Les R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voient effectivement une r\u00e9paration lorsqu\u2019une partie tente de s\u2019appuyer sur un document qui n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une divulgation. Le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu\u2019une partie ne d\u00e9pose pas un document qui est pertinent, elle ne peut pr\u00e9senter ce document en preuve lors de l\u2019audience sauf si elle obtient l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal. \u00c0 moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse \u00e9tablir que l\u2019omission du plaignant de divulguer les documents compromettra la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve, je ne vois aucun motif justifiant que je rejette l\u2019affaire sur ce fondement. La r\u00e9paration fournie par le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles est suffisante, \u00e0 mon avis, pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9faut de divulgation. Si un document qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 par le plaignant \u00e9tait jug\u00e9 essentiel \u00e0 la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal ordonnerait sa production.\n[25] Je ne vois pas comment les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles il y a eu une divulgation incorrecte soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourraient justifier une ordonnance de rejet de la plainte. Ces exigences en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure existent pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus. Le plaignant est un repr\u00e9sentant de la loi et un ancien membre instructeur du Tribunal et il est bien au courant des proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal et ne sera pas surpris s\u2019il subit un d\u00e9savantage s\u2019il ne respecte pas ces proc\u00e9dures.\n[26] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des dommages, l\u2019article 53 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit les r\u00e9parations offertes \u00e0 une personne victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 sa plainte est fond\u00e9e. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, cette personne est le plaignant, Benjamin Schecter. Dans sa divulgation dat\u00e9e du 13 ao\u00fbt 2004, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 les r\u00e9parations qu\u2019il tentait d\u2019obtenir. La question de savoir s\u2019il pouvait obtenir ces r\u00e9parations d\u00e9pend de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents quant aux dommages caus\u00e9s au plaignant par l\u2019intim\u00e9e du fait de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Dans son questionnaire et sa divulgation, il a en outre mentionn\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations quant \u00e0 la politique qui s\u2019expliquent par elles\u2011m\u00eames et des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires qui semblent renvoyer \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi. Je souligne que ces dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, seraient ceux de la victime, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire le plaignant.\n[27] En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me question soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la seule question soumise au Tribunal \u00e9tait la question de la politique identifi\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, il serait important de clarifier une certaine confusion qui existe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des r\u00f4les respectifs de la Commission et du Tribunal.\n[28] La Commission n\u2019est pas un organisme ayant un pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel; ce pouvoir appartient au Tribunal. La Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle rend une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si une plainte devrait \u00eatre instruite par le Tribunal, effectue une analyse pr\u00e9liminaire. Ce n\u2019est pas le r\u00f4le de la Commission de d\u00e9cider si la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Son devoir consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si, suivant les dispositions de la Loi, une instruction est justifi\u00e9e compte tenu de tous les faits. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment central du r\u00f4le de la Commission alors est celui d\u2019\u00e9valuer si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont elle dispose sont suffisants.\n[29] La principale fonction du Tribunal est de rendre des d\u00e9cisions. Il tient des audiences formelles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaintes que la Commission lui a renvoy\u00e9es. Il d\u00e9tient de nombreux pouvoirs qu\u2019une cour de justice d\u00e9tient. Il a le pouvoir de tirer des conclusions quant aux faits, d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer le droit aux faits qui lui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u2019adjuger des r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es. En outre, ses audiences ont presque la m\u00eame structure qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice. Les parties devant le Tribunal pr\u00e9sentent de la preuve, appellent des t\u00e9moins et proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 leurs contre\u2011interrogatoires et pr\u00e9sentent des observations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le droit devrait s\u2019appliquer aux faits. Le Tribunal ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques et ne proc\u00e8de pas \u00e0 ses propres enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaintes, les fonctions d\u2019enqu\u00eate et d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques ayant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative \u00e0 un organisme diff\u00e9rent, la Commission.\n[30] La Commission renvoie les plaintes au Tribunal. C\u2019est exactement ce qu\u2019elle a fait dans sa lettre du 6 janvier 2004. Il est clair \u00e0 la lecture de la lettre de la Commission adress\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire d\u2019alors que tous les aspects de la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal. Comme mon coll\u00e8gue, M. Hadjis, l\u2019a si clairement soulign\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2003 TCDP 32, il ne faut pas perdre de vue le fait que, m\u00eame si la Commission est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une plainte doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal (par. 44(3) et art. 49 de la Loi), la plainte demeure celle de la plaignante et non celle de la Commission.\n[31] Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u une plainte, le Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi, tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, peu importe l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte ou des r\u00e9parations, une fois qu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, la Commission devient seulement une des parties dans le processus.\n[32] Ce point m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me question se rapportant \u00e0 certaines incoh\u00e9rences contenues dans la plainte qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, illustrent qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune question \u00e0 trancher par le Tribunal. Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y a une question qui doit \u00eatre entendue par le Tribunal et cette question est celle de savoir si le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination en raison de l\u2019omission de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir fourni des installations pouvant accommoder sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[33] La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 ce que la pr\u00e9sente affaire soit rejet\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on sommaire est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. Le t\u00e9moin du plaignant, Marshall Schecter [34] Il m\u2019appara\u00eet important, avant de traiter des questions en litige, que je fasse des commentaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du comportement du t\u00e9moin et fils du plaignant, Marshall Schecter. Lors de l\u2019audience, le plaignant a choisi d\u2019appeler seulement deux t\u00e9moins en plus de lui\u2011m\u00eame. Ces t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient son \u00e9pouse, Mme Irma Schecter, et son fils, M. Marshall Schecter. Ce dernier \u00e9tait le t\u00e9moin important du plaignant \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, selon ce qu\u2019il a dit, [Traduction] peut-\u00eatre la seule personne pouvant relater les faits [\u2026] survenus le soir en question. Malheureusement pour le plaignant, M. Marshall Schecter n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette attente. Par son comportement, son caract\u00e8re col\u00e9reux, son hostilit\u00e9 non seulement envers l\u2019avocat de la partie adverse, mais \u00e9galement envers le pr\u00e9sident, ses interventions d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et ses nombreuses perturbations au cours de l\u2019audience, il est devenu un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s peu fiable.\n[35] Le premier jour de l\u2019audience, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait avocat, il agirait pour son propre compte. Cela n\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Marshall Schecter d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019instance et de se comporter comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa plainte. Le Tribunal aurait pu limiter sa participation, mais il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, croyant erron\u00e9ment que cela faciliterait le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience, de lui permettre de faire des repr\u00e9sentations au nom de son p\u00e8re. Le Tribunal, sachant ce qu\u2019il sait maintenant, pourrait aujourd\u2019hui rendre une d\u00e9cision diff\u00e9rente.\n[36] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, Marshall Schecter est intervenu pour mentionner qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u la documentation fournie aux parties par le Tribunal. Les dossiers du Tribunal indiquent que la lettre en question, dat\u00e9e du 18 mars 2004, a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e avec les documents \u00e0 l\u2019adresse du plaignant.\n[37] Une fois de plus, le premier jour, durant la pr\u00e9sentation des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses requ\u00eates, M. Marshall Schecter a interrompu l\u2019avocat et a dit : [Traduction] Je m\u2019excuse. Allons\u2011nous \u00e9couter cela ou \u00eates-vous cens\u00e9 rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces requ\u00eates. Parce qu\u2019en ce moment, il pr\u00e9sente sa preuve. \u00c0 un autre moment, il a accus\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de la partie adverse de [Traduction] ne pas dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et il l\u2019a trait\u00e9 de [Traduction] menteur. Il a en outre qualifi\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de [Traduction] fanatique.\n[38] Le 31 ao\u00fbt 2004, le deuxi\u00e8me jour de l\u2019audience, la question de la divulgation de documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 des photocopies de divers documents qui \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9s dans la divulgation du plaignant. Un document particulier qu\u2019il tentait d\u2019obtenir \u00e9tait une lettre sign\u00e9e par M. Marshall Schecter adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Charles Unterberg de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. La lettre renvoyait \u00e0 [Traduction] des renseignements pertinents se rapportant [\u2026] \u00e0 la plainte \u00e0 la Gare centrale de Montr\u00e9al le 7 juin. Elle \u00e9num\u00e9rait ensuite quatre lettres et mentionnait le nombre de pages jointes \u00e0 ces lettres. Une de ces lettres \u00e9tait \u00e9crite sur le papier \u00e0 en\u2011t\u00eate de l\u2019\u00e9tude Berkovitz et Strauber, et elle \u00e9tait sign\u00e9e par le plaignant. Elle mentionnait que des documents y \u00e9taient joints. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demandait que des photocopies de ces documents joints soient fournies.\n[39] Marshall Schecter a d\u2019abord mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en train de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager et qu\u2019un grand nombre de ces documents \u00e9taient entrepos\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ne serait peut\u2011\u00eatre pas capable de les trouver. Le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 que ces documents devraient \u00eatre fournis au plus tard le 2 septembre 2004 ou qu\u2019une explication devrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e quant aux raisons pour lesquelles ils ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre fournis. Apr\u00e8s un court ajournement, Marshall Schecter est revenu et a mentionn\u00e9 que ces documents ne pourraient pas \u00eatre fournis le 2 septembre 2004 parce que son imprimeur lui avait dit qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas faire des photocopies pour cette date.\n[40] Le Tribunal a ensuite ordonn\u00e9 que les documents et photocopies n\u00e9cessaires soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s le 2 septembre 2004. L\u2019\u00e9change suivant a ensuite eu lieu :\n[Traduction]\nM. M. Schecter : Je m\u2019excuse. Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir. Je ne peux pas respecter cela. Je\u2026\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Bien, alors \u00e0 ce moment\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Je m\u2019excuse. Est-ce que je peux finir s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet? J\u2019ai appel\u00e9 l\u2019imprimeur, ils\u2026\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Il y a\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : J\u2019ai appel\u00e9 Banner Blueprint que j\u2019utilise pour mon architecture, je connais les gens dans cette entreprise. Cela fait 20 ans que je fais des affaires avec eux. Cela prendra au moins trois jours pour les obtenir si je les apporte ce soir. Je ne peux pas les faire pr\u00e9parer plus rapidement et je le dis pour que cela soit consign\u00e9 au dossier.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Je suis aussi un avocat et on m\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 de faire des choses avec un tr\u00e8s court avis, ce que j\u2019ai fait. Il y a plus d\u2019un imprimeur dans la Ville de Montr\u00e9al, j\u2019en suis certain. [\u2026] J\u2019ordonne que ces documents soient \u00e9chang\u00e9s jeudi matin. Sinon, j\u2019ajournerai l\u2019audience \u00e0 ce moment.\nM. M. Schecter : Alors, je demande un ajournement...\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : C\u2019est mon ordonnance.\nM. M. Schecter : Alors, je demande de\u2026 si nous pouvons remettre cela \u00e0 la semaine prochaine, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Cela ne sera pas remis jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la semaine prochaine. Cela sera remis jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties aient proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te et ensuite nous verrons quelles dates seront fix\u00e9es.\nM. M. Schecter : Alors je sugg\u00e8re que nous fassions cela maintenant s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Alors, cela sera ajourn\u00e9 sine die.\nM. B. Schecter : Est-ce que je peux\u2026 si je peux dire un mot, [\u2026] M. le pr\u00e9sident. Je suis au courant des difficult\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es par mon fils au Tribunal et je veux vous dire une chose, il agit dans la plupart des cas aussi rapidement que toute personne peut le faire et je sais que ce sera physiquement impossible de faire pr\u00e9parer pour jeudi tout ce dont nous avons discut\u00e9. Il a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et\u2026 il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une tentative de cacher ou retarder quoi que ce soit.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Je sais cela M. Schecter. Mais nous parlons maintenant d\u2019une photocopie de ces documents qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s.\nM. M. Schecter : Une ou six, c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Bien, six exemplaires seront n\u00e9cessaires pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t devant le Tribunal. Nous n\u2019en sommes pas l\u00e0. Nous parlons d\u2019un exemplaire devant \u00eatre fourni \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie. Je serai de retour ici jeudi matin et si \u00e0 ce moment les parties ne sont pas pr\u00eates \u00e0 fournir ces documents, j\u2019ajournerai la pr\u00e9sente affaire et j\u2019attendrai jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que toute la documentation appropri\u00e9e\u2026 je n\u2019accepterai pas\u2026 le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal est un important tribunal, et vous le savez M. Schecter.\nM. B. Schecter : Oh, oui. Effectivement.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Vous comprenez que la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne sera pas transform\u00e9e en ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas. C\u2019est une instance judicaire et je vais respecter les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. Maintenant, je sugg\u00e8re que ces documents soient \u00e9chang\u00e9s jeudi matin. Cela donne 48 heures. Si cela ne peut pas \u00eatre fait, alors l\u2019instance sera ajourn\u00e9e.\n[\u2026]\nM. M. Schecter : Pour tous les documents, cela ne peut pas \u00eatre fait.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Votre fils a la liste des documents auxquels nous renvoyons. Alors, je serai de retour ici jeudi matin, et nous verrons o\u00f9 en sont les parties. Alors, cela conclut l\u2019affaire pour aujourd\u2019hui, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019autres questions en litige.\n[\u2026]\nM. M. Schecter : [\u2026] Je veux juste mentionner pour que cela soit consign\u00e9 au dossier que je ne pourrai pas fournir toute la documentation.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Bien, vous expliquerez au Tribunal \u00e0 ce moment, le 2, les raisons pour lesquelles vous ne pouvez pas fournir ces documents. Mais, nous nous r\u00e9unirons de nouveau le 2 et nous verrons o\u00f9 nous en sommes.\n[41] Les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et fournis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le jeudi 2 septembre 2004 comme le Tribunal l\u2019avait ordonn\u00e9.\n[42] Le 3 septembre 2004, une requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la production d\u2019autres documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Bureau d\u2019\u00e9thique professionnelle du service de police de la Ville de Longueuil, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des agents Greffard et Sauv\u00e9 et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus le 7 juin 2001 \u00e0 la Gare centrale du CN. M. Marshall Schecter s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la production de ces documents en all\u00e9guant que les renseignements y contenus faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge suivant la Loi sur les jeunes contrevenants, L.R.C., ch. Y\u20111 [abrog\u00e9e, 2002, ch. 1, art. 199.]. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte et dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au Tribunal le 13 ao\u00fbt 2004 par M. Marshall Schecter.\n[43] Dans la plainte les \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9s comme suit :\n[Traduction]\n\u00c0 ce moment, mon \u00e9pouse et mon petit\u2011fils \u00e9taient aux prises avec des policiers de la Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al (CUM). Un des policiers a saisi mon petit\u2011fils, l\u2019a menac\u00e9, l\u2019a violemment pouss\u00e9 dans le dos avec son genou et l\u2019a frapp\u00e9 au visage \u00e0 plusieurs reprises [\u2026].\nMon fils [Marshall Schecter] a tent\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir, mais un autre policier l\u2019a pouss\u00e9 brutalement.\nMon \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de choc et en pleurs et elle a essay\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des explications de la part des policiers qui sont devenus tr\u00e8s agressifs; l\u2019un d\u2019eux lui a donn\u00e9 un coup de poing \u00e0 la poitrine et un autre lui a pinc\u00e9 le bras gauche.\n[44] Une fois de plus, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 13 ao\u00fbt 2004, sign\u00e9e par M. Marshall Schecter en tant que [Traduction] [repr\u00e9sentant] des int\u00e9r\u00eats de [sa] famille, nous lisons ce qui suit sous le titre [Traduction] Dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires :\n[Traduction]\nPour les coups cruels et brutaux et l\u2019arrestation de mon fils et pour l\u2019accusation d\u2019agression port\u00e9e contre lui, un mineur, entreprise par le C.N. et un employ\u00e9 du C.N dans le but de cr\u00e9er un moyen de n\u00e9gociation afin que nous abandonnions notre cause. L\u2019accusation d\u2019agression port\u00e9e contre mon fils mineur a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e par la Couronne.\nPour l\u2019agression physique et vicieuse contre ma m\u00e8re et moi, et parce que 4 gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du C.N. qui portaient des gants noirs et 4 policiers ont inutilement pouss\u00e9 mon p\u00e8re (qui est handicap\u00e9) dans un fourgon cellulaire.

En outre, le harc\u00e8lement constant du C.N. jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant.\nLes dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires demand\u00e9s sont le montant maximal pr\u00e9vu par la loi suivant le pouvoir de la Commission multipli\u00e9 par quatre, soit pour mon fils, ma m\u00e8re, mon p\u00e8re et moi.\n[45] Puisque ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant pour justifier sa demande de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires, les documents s\u2019y rapportant sont devenus des documents dont la pertinence peut \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9e et devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les arguments des parties sur cette question, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que le document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Bureau d\u2019\u00e9thique professionnelle du service de police de la Ville de Longueuil, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des agents Greffard et Sauv\u00e9 et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 7 juin 2001 \u00e0 la Gare centrale du CN , soit divulgu\u00e9 et, afin de traiter des pr\u00e9occupations du plaignant quant \u00e0 son petit\u2011fils, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que tous les renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 un mineur qui pourraient \u00eatre inclus dans ce document soient retir\u00e9s. J\u2019ai en outre ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e consulte le document aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente audience seulement et qu\u2019elle ne divulgue pas son contenu \u00e0 quiconque autre que son avocat.\n[46] \u00c0 ce moment, M. Marshall Schecter est devenu tr\u00e8s agressif et il a vivement exprim\u00e9 son intention de ne pas respecter l\u2019ordonnance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 son p\u00e8re a d\u00fb intervenir et lui dire ce qui suit : [Traduction] C\u2019est assez. Plus tard durant la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, toute la question de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires pour le plaignant et sa famille a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e lorsque le plaignant a reconnu que la seule personne qui pouvait demander des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires \u00e9tait lui\u2011m\u00eame, si le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa demande \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9. La demande de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires mentionn\u00e9s dans la lettre de M. Marshall Schecter dat\u00e9e du 13 ao\u00fbt 2004, pour sa m\u00e8re, son fils et lui\u2011m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n[47] Plus tard le m\u00eame jour, M. Marshall Schecter s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence dans la salle d\u2019un homme du service de police en disant qu\u2019il ne voulait pas de lui \u00e0 l\u2019audience. L\u2019\u00e9change ci\u2011apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9 a suivi :\n[Traduction]\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Demandez-vous une exclusion de t\u00e9moins?\nM. M. Schecter : Je demande son exclusion parce que nous ne l\u2019avons pas encore accept\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin\u2026 parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation se rapportant encore \u00e0 [\u00e9l\u00e9ment supprim\u00e9] et [\u00e9l\u00e9ment supprim\u00e9] y est vis\u00e9 et cela c\u2019est contre la Loi sur les jeunes contrevenants.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : M. Schecter, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une audience publique. \u00c0 moins que vous demandiez une exclusion de t\u00e9moins, c\u2019est une audience publique\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Bien, c\u2019est M\u2026 \u00eates\u2011vous M. Des\u00e8ve? Bien s\u2019il s\u2019agit de M. Des\u00e8ve, c\u2019est l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Demandez\u2011vous une exclusion de t\u00e9moins?\nM. M. Schecter : Je demande son exclusion de la salle d\u2019audience.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Je ne vais pas exclure un t\u00e9moin. Demandez\u2011vous une exclusion de t\u00e9moins?\nM. M. Schecter : Bien, pourquoi devrait\u2011il pouvoir participer \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0; il n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la situation mais il pr\u00e9sente un document, encore, contre [\u00e9l\u00e9ment supprim\u00e9]. Alors ce que je sugg\u00e9rerais que nous fassions maintenant, si cela ne vous d\u00e9range pas que je le dise, et je ne suis pas avocat, mais je veux proposer que nous parlions de la Loi sur les jeunes contrevenants. Je ne veux pas discuter, mais je vous dis que cela a un lien parce qu\u2019il le pr\u00e9sente en preuve et j\u2019ai vu ce document de la Couronne. Alors, nous y revenons encore et je ne l\u2019ai jamais donn\u00e9 au CN.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : S\u2019il y a des documents se rapportant \u00e0 [\u00e9l\u00e9ment supprim\u00e9] qu\u2019ils essaieront de pr\u00e9senter en preuve, vous pourrez soulever ces objections \u00e0 ce moment. Ce matin lorsque je parle de la divulgation de documents, cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019ils sont admis en preuve.\nM. M. Schecter : Je ne vais pas rester assis ici jour apr\u00e8s jour et parler de [\u00e9l\u00e9ment supprim\u00e9], d\u2019accord [\u2026]. Bien, nous sommes venus ici pour t\u00e9moigner. Ou bien nous t\u00e9moignons ou bien nous partons. Veuillez nous dire ce qui se passe et continuons la cause.\n[48] On a alors demand\u00e9 au plaignant d\u2019appeler son premier t\u00e9moin. M. Marshall Schecter est une fois de plus intervenu comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nM. M. Schecter : Bien alors, allez\u2011y. Ils voulaient appeler mon p\u00e8re.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Non, c\u2019est votre\u2026 c\u2019est votre cause, M. Schecter.\n[\u2026]\nM. B. Schecter : Bien, \u00e7a d\u00e9pend de moi alors parce que je suis l\u2019avocat ici et la question de savoir si je porterai ou non deux chapeaux par la suite est une autre question, mais je suis l\u2019avocat et nous sommes pr\u00eats \u00e0\u2026 nous sommes pr\u00eats \u00e0 commencer.\nM. M. Schecter : Une des raisons pour lesquelles nous ne pouvons appeler aucun t\u00e9moin est que nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s par le CN et le service de police de citer des t\u00e9moins.\nM. B. Schecter : Bien, cela sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Exactement. Alors maintenant nous n\u2019avons aucun t\u00e9moin \u00e0 appeler.\n[49] Malgr\u00e9 les commentaires de son fils, le plaignant a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve.\n[50] Le 10 septembre 2004, M. Marshall Schecter a fait une autre intervention vive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de questions, pos\u00e9es par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qu\u2019il estimait irrespectueuses \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de son p\u00e8re. Son p\u00e8re lui a alors dit que si des objections devaient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es, il le ferait lui\u2011m\u00eame. Il a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que parfois son fils [Traduction] devient un peu trop z\u00e9l\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la protection qu\u2019il [lui] offre.\n[51] Le 23 septembre 2004, au cours du t\u00e9moignage de sa m\u00e8re, M. Marshall Schecter a interrompu une fois de plus l\u2019audience et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer le t\u00e9moignage que rendait sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la disposition physique de l\u2019immeuble r\u00e9sidentiel dans lequel elle et le plaignant avaient v\u00e9cu. Selon M. Marshall Schecter, il avait [Traduction] le droit de soulever une objection \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [Traduction] donnait des renseignements erron\u00e9s. Le pr\u00e9sident a d\u00fb expliquer \u00e0 M. Marshall Schecter que son p\u00e8re agissait pour son propre compte et que, s\u2019il souhaitait le faire, il pourrait en r\u00e9plique demander au t\u00e9moin de corriger les renseignements s\u2019ils sont erron\u00e9s.\n[52] L\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e le 23 septembre 2004 et n\u2019a repris que le 9 mai 2005. Marshall Schecter \u00e9tait le t\u00e9moin du plaignant ce jour\u2011l\u00e0. Il \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s r\u00e9calcitrant et \u00e0 certains moments il \u00e9tait agressif et antagoniste.\n[53] En fait, ce qui rendait furieux le t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait mes questions quant \u00e0 savoir o\u00f9 son v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 le 7 juin 2001. Le t\u00e9moin ne semblait pas se rendre compte que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel judiciaire dans notre syst\u00e8me accusatoire s\u2019appuie sur le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix fourni par des t\u00e9moins examin\u00e9s par le juge des faits, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le membre instructeur du Tribunal. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c\u2019est le r\u00f4le des parties, non celui du Tribunal, d\u2019appeler et d\u2019examiner des t\u00e9moins. Bien que la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve soit laiss\u00e9e aux parties et aux avocats, le juge des faits a le droit d\u2019interroger les t\u00e9moins. En fait, j\u2019ajouterais que c\u2019est son devoir de le faire s\u2019il est d\u2019avis que l\u2019interrogatoire est n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer correctement la preuve du t\u00e9moin. Dans ses questions, le juge des faits n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 des demandes visant \u00e0 clarifier des points douteux et il peut \u00e9tendre les questions \u00e0 des points qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s lors de l\u2019interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins par les avocats. (Voir le trait\u00e9 de Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2e \u00e9dition, \u00e0 la section 16.9.) C\u2019\u00e9tait la raison des questions que j\u2019ai pos\u00e9es au t\u00e9moin. J\u2019avais le sentiment que l\u2019interrogatoire principal \u00e9tait incomplet et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait toujours pas de r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 de nombreux points qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre trait\u00e9s.\n[54] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a d\u2019abord demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 il avait stationn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule, le t\u00e9moin a dit qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas [Traduction] exactement indiquer l\u2019endroit pr\u00e9cis. Afin de l\u2019aider, je lui ai demand\u00e9 de regarder un croquis du complexe de la Gare centrale qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve. Je lui ai alors demand\u00e9 une fois de plus s\u2019il pouvait me montrer o\u00f9 il avait stationn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule et il a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit : [Traduction] Dans ce coin\u2011l\u00e0. Je ne peux pas le dire exactement [\u2026]. Pour que ce soit plus facile pour moi, lorsque j\u2019examinerais la preuve, je lui ai demand\u00e9 de mettre ses initiales \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019endroit qu\u2019il avait indiqu\u00e9 et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que les choses ont \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 tout contr\u00f4le. Il a dit qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait ne pas faire ce que je lui demandais parce qu\u2019il ne [Traduction] voulait pas \u00eatre li\u00e9 par cela. Il a en outre ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Si je vais sur place et que je prends des mesures, alors c\u2019est avec plaisir que je le ferai. L\u2019\u00e9change suivant a ensuite eu lieu :\n[Traduction]\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Pouvez\u2011vous seulement mettre vos initiales l\u00e0, vos initiales -- Marshall Schecter -- seulement pour indiquer \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s o\u00f9 vous \u00e9tiez\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais ne pas le faire.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Bien, je vous demanderais de le faire pour indiquer\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Je ne veux pas \u00eatre li\u00e9 par cela. Je ne veux pas \u00eatre li\u00e9 par cela parce que je sais que j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ici\u2026\n[55] Le t\u00e9moin oubliait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait sous serment, et qu\u2019il serait li\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il rendait, et que si ce t\u00e9moignage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair il serait alors difficile pour moi de rendre sur cette question une d\u00e9cision favorable au plaignant.\n[56] Le t\u00e9moin a ensuite commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 argumenter, il a \u00e9lev\u00e9 la voix et a une fois de plus contest\u00e9 mon pouvoir. L\u2019\u00e9change a continu\u00e9 comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Alors, vous ne pouvez pas indiquer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment o\u00f9 vous \u00e9tiez?\nM. M. Schecter : Si je me rends sur place et que je prends des mesures, alors c\u2019est avec plaisir que je le ferai.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : D\u2019accord, je n\u2019ai pas de preuve quant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit exact o\u00f9 vous aviez stationn\u00e9 votre v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 ce moment. D\u2019accord.\nM. M. Schecter : J\u2019aimerais dire que je veux que ce soit mesur\u00e9 et alors je reviendrai et je vous le dirai, est-ce que \u00e7a convient? [\u2026] Bien\u2026 bien, \u00e9coutez, vous me demandez de mettre mon\u2026je ne connais pas l\u2019\u00e9chelle du plan\u2026 [...] et si nous devons entrer dans des d\u00e9tails techniques, j\u2019ai le droit et je veux qu\u2019il soit inscrit au dossier que je veux conna\u00eetre l\u2019\u00e9chelle et que je vais prendre des mesures et qu\u2019alors je vais le signer. Mais\u2026\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Les \u00e9chelles ne sont pas importantes. La seule chose\u2026\nM. M. Schecter : Oui, elles le sont pour moi, Monsieur. Si nous parlons de d\u00e9tails techniques, elles le sont.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : D\u2019accord, Monsieur, si vous\u2026 la preuve que j\u2019ai est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aujourd\u2019hui; c\u2019est ce que j\u2019obtiens et je n\u2019ai pas\u2026 [interrompu en milieu de phrase].\nM. M. Schecter : [D\u2019une voix forte, presque en criant.] Bien, non alors, je m\u2019excuse, nous\u2026 je ne veux pas continuer sans avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre\u2026\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Monsieur, c\u2019est moi qui d\u00e9cide si nous continuons ou non.\nM. M. Schecter : [En criant.] Non, je d\u00e9cide.\nLe Pr\u00e9sident : Non, vous \u00eates le t\u00e9moin! [Il y a un point d\u2019acclamation dans la transcription \u2013 SJ.)\n[57] J\u2019ai alors essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9tablir l\u2019ordre, mais il n\u2019y avait rien \u00e0 faire. Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une dispute avec le t\u00e9moin, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience pendant cinq minutes dans l\u2019espoir que la pause lui permettrait de se calmer.\n[58] Lorsque l\u2019audience a repris, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses excuses pour ce qui venait juste de se passer, mais son \u00e9pouse est intervenue et elle a dit : [Traduction] Aucune excuse n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire. Le plaignant a essay\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer le comportement de son fils, mais le t\u00e9moin ne l\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 finir son explication et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 agir de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on selon laquelle il agissait avant la pause. \u00c0 un moment, le plaignant est de nouveau intervenu en disant \u00e0 son fils d\u2019une voix s\u00e9v\u00e8re : [Traduction] Cela suffit maintenant\u2026, mais cela n\u2019a rien chang\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moin m\u2019a alors menac\u00e9 en disant qu\u2019il ferait un compte rendu complet des \u00e9v\u00e9nements [Traduction] au Tribunal, au Barreau et \u00e0 tout le reste parce que c\u2019est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9thique et immoral. Et c\u2019est tout, aucune autre discussion. Une fois de plus, son p\u00e8re est intervenu en lui disant : [Traduction] Juste un moment, il va y avoir un contre\u2011interrogatoire, maintenant \u00e9coute simplement M. McMurray.\n[59] \u00c0 ce moment, M. McMurray a demand\u00e9 une pause pour pr\u00e9parer son contre-interrogatoire. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait 11 h 28, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire une pause pour le repas du midi. J\u2019esp\u00e9rais que cette pause permettrait au t\u00e9moin de se calmer et de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, suivant les conseils de son p\u00e8re, sur son comportement au cours de l\u2019audience. Une fois de plus, le t\u00e9moin a contest\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision en disant sur un ton fort : [Traduction] Je m\u2019excuse, j\u2019ai une r\u00e9union \u00e0 15 heures et nous avons [\u2026]. J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 le silence, mais une fois de plus le t\u00e9moin est intervenu agressivement en disant ce qui suit : [Traduction] Partons, c\u2019est fini! Je ne reviendrai pas, ne perdez pas votre temps! [Les points d\u2019exclamation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits par le st\u00e9nographe judiciaire.]\n[60] Malheureusement, le plaignant et son t\u00e9moin ne sont pas revenus \u00e0 l\u2019audience en apr\u00e8s\u2011midi et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de son droit de proc\u00e9der au contre\u2011interrogatoire du t\u00e9moin. J\u2019ai alors ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audience jusqu\u2019au lendemain matin.\n[61] Le m\u00eame apr\u00e8s\u2011midi du 9 mai 2005, selon mes directives, le plaignant a personnellement re\u00e7u signification d\u2019une lettre sign\u00e9e par Gregory M. Smith, le registraire du Tribunal. Un affidavit de signification asserment\u00e9 par Michel Fiset, un huissier de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal. Dans cet affidavit, M. Fiset a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait personnellement signifi\u00e9 au plaignant \u00e0 son domicile le 9 mai 2005, \u00e0 19 h 26, un exemplaire de la lettre. La lettre en question informait le plaignant que le Tribunal avait ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audience jusqu\u2019\u00e0 9 h 30 le mardi 10 mai 2005 et que, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le plaignant ne serait pas pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 ce moment, le Tribunal continuerait l\u2019audition de la plainte en son absence. La lettre informait de plus le plaignant que le Tribunal ne tol\u00e9rerait aucun autre \u00e9clat de la part du t\u00e9moin du plaignant, M. Marshall Schecter. Je suis convaincu, compte tenu de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, que le plaignant a effectivement re\u00e7u un avis appropri\u00e9 l\u2019informant que l\u2019instance reprendrait le 10 mai 2005 et qu\u2019il a choisi de ne pas s\u2019y pr\u00e9senter.\n[62] Le 10 mai 2005 et les autres jours d\u2019audience, l\u2019agent du greffe commen\u00e7ait l\u2019audience en demandant si Benjamin Schecter, le plaignant, ou quelqu\u2019un le repr\u00e9sentant, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent dans la salle d\u2019audience. Le dossier de l\u2019audience refl\u00e8te que les demandes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019ont re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse.\n[63] Le plaignant a eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019audience, de pr\u00e9senter de la preuve et de faire des repr\u00e9sentations. Sans donner aucun motif quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision ou sans d\u00e9poser devant le Tribunal une requ\u00eate pour retirer sa plainte, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte des instructions contenues dans la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 9 mai 2005 et il a choisi de ne plus participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. En agissant ainsi, le plaignant a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de compara\u00eetre, de pr\u00e9senter de la preuve, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un contre\u2011interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de pr\u00e9senter des observations finales.\n[64] Quant \u00e0 elle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a choisi de participer pleinement \u00e0 l\u2019instance et elle ne devrait pas subir un pr\u00e9judice du fait que le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas en faire autant.\n[65] Conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs que m\u2019accorde la Loi pour trancher toute question de proc\u00e9dure ou de droit soulev\u00e9e au cours de l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poursuivre l\u2019audience en l\u2019absence du plaignant. J\u2019\u00e9tais d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important, pour toutes les parties en cause, qu\u2019une conclusion d\u00e9finitive soit tir\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la question en litige. Beaucoup de temps, de pr\u00e9paration et de ressources financi\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience et \u00e0 l\u2019audience elle\u2011m\u00eame et j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u2019avis que ce n\u2019est pas parce qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience que ce temps, cette pr\u00e9paration et ces ressources devaient \u00eatre gaspill\u00e9s. (Pour des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal dans lesquelles les audiences se sont poursuivies en l\u2019absence de l\u2019une des parties voir Fox c. Musqueam Indian Band & Hargitt, 2004 TCDP 17 (CanLII); Sanusi c. Brown, 2004 TCDP 33 (CanLII); Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. et DesRosiers c.

Mais pour \u00eatre juste envers lui, apr\u00e8s avoir vu et entendu ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 le jour en question et les jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, je ne suis toujours pas convaincu qu\u2019il a pris cette d\u00e9cision de son propre gr\u00e9. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le plaignant comprend totalement, j\u2019en suis certain, les cons\u00e9quences de sa d\u00e9cision.\n[67] Quant au t\u00e9moignage rendu par Marshall Schecter, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais eu la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son contre-interrogatoire, sa pertinence et son importance seront tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es.\nIV. Les Faits [68] Le plaignant souffre d\u2019une maladie d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative chronique de la colonne lombaire. Bien qu\u2019aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il souffre effectivement d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience.\n[69] En 1999, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec lui a envoy\u00e9 un Certificat d\u2019attestation et une vignette de stationnement pour personne handicap\u00e9e \u00e0 accrocher au r\u00e9troviseur int\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule.\n[70] Le plaignant a reconnu que ce qu\u2019il savait quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui constituent le fondement de sa demande est limit\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent durant la majeure partie de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements et qu\u2019un grand nombre des renseignements qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements provient de son fils. \u00c0 de nombreuses reprises, le plaignant a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que c\u2019est son fils qui s\u2019est occup\u00e9 de la plus grande partie de la correspondance, des appels et des communications se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[71] L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utile comme t\u00e9moin. Elle a admis qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait \u00e9galement qu\u2019une connaissance limit\u00e9e des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et qu\u2019elle s\u2019appuyait sur les renseignements que lui avait donn\u00e9s son fils. En outre, son comportement en tant que t\u00e9moin n\u2019a pas aid\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir les faits. Elle argumentait beaucoup et \u00e0 un certain moment elle a manifest\u00e9 de l\u2019impatience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019avocat et du Tribunal.\n[72] Au cours de son mandat en tant que membre instructeur du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, le plaignant devait se rendre \u00e0 Ottawa pour entendre des causes. \u00c0 ces occasions, son \u00e9pouse et lui partaient de la Gare centrale du CN \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (Gare centrale). Le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient voyag\u00e9 en train entre Montr\u00e9al et Ottawa [Traduction] au moins \u00e0 une centaine de reprises. Le plaignant a reconnu qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019exception du 7 juin 2001, ils avaient toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits des services fournis \u00e0 la Gare centrale.\n[73] \u00c0 leurs retours \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, leur fils, Marshall Schecter, venait les chercher \u00e0 la Gare centrale. Selon M. Marshall Schecter, il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 la Gare centrale [Traduction] au cours des dix (10) derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, approximativement vingt\u2011cinq \u00e0 trente (25 \u00e0 30) fois par ann\u00e9e, aller\u2011retour, ce qui ferait cinquante \u00e0 soixante (50 \u00e0 60) fois par ann\u00e9e. Faire descendre ses parents \u00e0 la Gare centrale pouvait prendre entre cinq (5) et dix (10) minutes et venir les chercher entre quinze (15) et vingt (20) minutes. Il a en outre reconnu [Traduction] n\u2019avoir jamais subi d\u2019indicent \u00e0 la Gare centrale.\n[74] M. Michel Legault, qui au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente audience \u00e9tait le directeur, Projets sp\u00e9ciaux, Canada et \u00c9tats-Unis, chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a rendu un t\u00e9moignage quant \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9nagement physique de la Gare centrale. La Gare centrale appartient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Son objet est principalement de fournir aux passagers de VIA Rail, d\u2019Amtrak et de l\u2019AMT un acc\u00e8s aux trains.\n[75] G\u00e9ographiquement, le complexe de la Gare centrale est situ\u00e9 dans un carr\u00e9 born\u00e9 au nord par le boulevard Ren\u00e9\u2011L\u00e9vesque, \u00e0 l\u2019ouest par la rue Mansfield, \u00e0 l\u2019est par la rue University et au sud par la rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. Il y a au sud du complexe une entr\u00e9e en forme de fer \u00e0 cheval qui permet l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00e0 la Gare centrale et la sortie par la rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. Le fer \u00e0 cheval sert \u00e9galement de voie d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux v\u00e9hicules d\u2019urgence. Il n\u2019y a pas de stationnement public dans le fer \u00e0 cheval bien que les taxis qui fournissent un service aux passagers qui passent par la Gare centrale aient le droit d\u2019y stationner, de m\u00eame que les v\u00e9hicules appartenant \u00e0 Budget Rent\u2011A\u2011Car. De plus, certaines places de stationnement sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux dirigeants de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de VIA Rail.\n[76] L\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval est surveill\u00e9e par des gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui, bien qu\u2019ils soient des employ\u00e9s d\u2019une tierce partie, sont supervis\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019un des buts de la pr\u00e9sence de ces gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il y ait un mouvement continu de la circulation dans l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval. Selon M. Legault, il existe une politique de tol\u00e9rance dans les cas o\u00f9 quelqu\u2019un aide une personne \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite ou une personne qui a de nombreux bagages. Dans ces circonstances, les gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 permettent que des v\u00e9hicules restent sans surveillance pendant quelques minutes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que le conducteur du v\u00e9hicule aide le passager \u00e0 entrer dans la Gare centrale ou \u00e0 retirer certains bagages du v\u00e9hicule.\n[77] Il y a au milieu du fer \u00e0 cheval, un stationnement public, exploit\u00e9 par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, qui est accessible par la rue de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. Le nom que l\u2019on donne \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce stationnement public est le stationnement South Plaza. Il y a un autre stationnement, le Garage Belmont, qui est accessible par la rue Mansfield et la rue University.\n[78] Le Garage Belmont est situ\u00e9 directement au\u2011dessus du stationnement South Plaza. Il comporte quatre (4) \u00e9tages de stationnement et un stationnement sur le toit. On acc\u00e8de \u00e0 la Gare centrale \u00e0 partir de ce garage par des ascenseurs et un escalier. Les ascenseurs donnent acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la portion est du fer \u00e0 cheval, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019entr\u00e9e principale de la Gare centrale.\n[79] Il n\u2019y a pas de places de stationnement d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme place de stationnement pour handicap\u00e9 dans le stationnement South Plaza, mais dans le Garage Belmont il y a deux places de stationnement par \u00e9tage, sauf sur le toit, qui sont ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Ces places de stationnement sont situ\u00e9es pr\u00e8s des ascenseurs de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que lors de la descente d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule, l\u2019ascenseur soit facilement accessible pour le conducteur et les passagers du v\u00e9hicule. Une fois dans l\u2019ascenseur, le conducteur et les passagers sont conduits au rez\u2011de\u2011chauss\u00e9e du Garage Belmont o\u00f9 ils doivent prendre un autre ascenseur qui les conduira au niveau de la gare centrale.\n[80] Pour faciliter la mobilit\u00e9 pour entrer dans la Gare centrale et en sortir, il n\u2019y a aucune bordure \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e principale. L\u2019entr\u00e9e comporte \u00e9galement des portes automatiques. Des bancs sont disponibles pour que les gens puissent s\u2019asseoir pendant qu\u2019ils attendent. Des employ\u00e9s de VIA, des porteurs appel\u00e9s Red Caps, sont disponibles pour aider les passagers \u00e0 transporter leurs bagages.\n[81] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des caract\u00e9ristiques physiques de la Gare centrale, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le 7 juin 2001 il n\u2019y avait rien de diff\u00e9rent par rapport \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il avait remarqu\u00e9 lors de ses visites pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\n[82] Le 7 juin 2001, le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse revenaient \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en train en provenance d\u2019Ottawa. Le train devait arriver \u00e0 la Gare centrale \u00e0 17 h 08. Selon la preuve, le train num\u00e9ro 34 de VIA, en provenance d\u2019Ottawa, est arriv\u00e9 ce jour \u00e0 17 h 15, avec un retard de sept (7) minutes. Il y avait 93 passagers \u00e0 bord du train. Approximativement \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure (17 h 06), le train num\u00e9ro 60 en provenance de Toronto est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Gare centrale avec 284 passagers \u00e0 bord.\n[83] Ce que Marshall Schecter se souvient quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits \u00e0 la suite de son arriv\u00e9e dans le fer \u00e0 cheval le 7 juin 2001 diff\u00e8re de ce que se souvient le gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00c9ric Geoffroy, qui travaillait dans le stationnement South Plaza ce jour\u2011l\u00e0. Compte tenu du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais eu la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un contre\u2011interrogatoire de Marshall Schecter et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le comportement de ce t\u00e9moin a rendu son t\u00e9moignage peu fiable, en cas de contradiction, c\u2019est le t\u00e9moignage de M. Geoffroy qui sera pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[84] Marshall Schecter a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Gare centrale \u00e0 16 h 57 le 7 juin 2001. Ni le plaignant ni son \u00e9pouse ne pouvaient confirmer son t\u00e9moignage. Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas personnellement si le v\u00e9hicule avait \u00e9t\u00e9 stationn\u00e9 plus de 15 minutes. Il a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] C\u2019est mon fils qui m\u2019a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 16 h 57. Il a ajout\u00e9 que ce dernier serait plus en mesure que lui de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. Malheureusement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter l\u2019audience, cela ne s\u2019est jamais produit.\n[85] Dans le [Traduction] Compte rendu d\u2019incident qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 7 juin 2001, M. Geoffroy a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Schecter \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Gare centrale \u00e0 16 h 40. Je ne vois aucune raison de mettre en doute la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Geoffroy sur ce point. Il se pr\u00e9sentait comme un t\u00e9moin calme et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 et il consultait ses notes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es au moment des \u00e9v\u00e9nements mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte. Le plaignant a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der au contre\u2011interrogatoire de M. Geoffroy, mais en d\u00e9cidant de se retirer de l\u2019instance, il a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce droit et la preuve de M. Geoffroy n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. J\u2019accepterai la preuve de M. Geoffroy selon laquelle Marshall Schecter est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare \u00e0 environ 16 h 40 et non \u00e0 16 h 57.\n[86] Marshall Schecter a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est approch\u00e9 de lui [Traduction] dans les soixante secondes de son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la Gare centrale et lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Pouvez\u2011vous d\u00e9placer votre v\u00e9hicule s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet?. Il a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] Non, je ne le d\u00e9placerai pas. Il a dit qu\u2019il a alors demand\u00e9 au gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pourquoi il devrait d\u00e9placer son v\u00e9hicule et la r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 : [Traduction] Parce que vous bloquez. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il d\u00e9placerait le v\u00e9hicule d\u2019environ une ou deux longueurs de voiture, mais selon lui cela n\u2019a pas satisfait le gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00c0 ce moment, il dit qu\u2019il a accroch\u00e9 au r\u00e9troviseur int\u00e9rieur la vignette pour personne handicap\u00e9e et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] Je ne le d\u00e9placerai pas du tout. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 le [Traduction] harceler et qu\u2019il [Traduction] est devenu en col\u00e8re.\n[87] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 il avait stationn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, Marshall Schecter n\u2019a jamais donn\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer sur un croquis du complexe de la Gare centrale o\u00f9 il avait stationn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule et de mettre ses initiales \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019endroit indiqu\u00e9, il a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais ne pas le faire. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi dans une autre portion de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de les reprendre sauf pour ajouter que le Tribunal n\u2019a re\u00e7u \u00e0 aucun moment de preuve provenant des t\u00e9moins du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 et il ne peut que tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable de cette absence de preuve.\n[88] M. Geoffroy n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre approch\u00e9 du v\u00e9hicule de M. Schecter \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord du fer \u00e0 cheval, tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s de l\u2019entr\u00e9e principale de la Gare centrale.\n[89] Il a dit qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait approch\u00e9 du v\u00e9hicule et avait demand\u00e9 au conducteur ce qu\u2019il attendait \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun train ne devait arriver \u00e0 cette heure. Il a ajout\u00e9 que Marshall Schecter a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il venait chercher son p\u00e8re qui avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher et qui arrivait d\u2019Ottawa en train. M. Geoffroy lui a alors demand\u00e9 de revenir \u00e0 17 heures \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle il pouvait attendre dans le fer \u00e0 cheval n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus de cinq (5) minutes. Marshall Schecter a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne bougerait pas et il a alors sorti de la bo\u00eete \u00e0 gants la vignette pour personne handicap\u00e9e et il l\u2019a accroch\u00e9e au r\u00e9troviseur int\u00e9rieur.\n[90] M. Geoffroy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pour calmer la situation, il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Schecter d\u00e9place son v\u00e9hicule de trente (30) ou trente\u2011cinq (35) pieds de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ne bloque pas la circulation. M. Schecter a une fois de plus refus\u00e9.\n[91] M. Geoffroy a ajout\u00e9 que M. Marshall Schecter et son fils sont alors devenus verbalement agressifs et il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019appeler un coll\u00e8gue pour l\u2019appuyer. \u00c0 ce moment, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 17 heures. Son coll\u00e8gue a essay\u00e9 de parler \u00e0 M. Schecter, mais cela n\u2019a rien chang\u00e9. Ils ont alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019appeler les policiers de la Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al. Le premier v\u00e9hicule de police est arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux \u00e0 17 h10. M. Geoffroy a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer ce qui venait de se passer et alors les policiers ont pris la situation en mains. Il a ajout\u00e9 que ses coll\u00e8gues et lui \u00e9taient rest\u00e9s sur place en tant qu\u2019observateurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, mais qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas intervenus quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi.\n[92] La situation s\u2019\u00e9tant intensifi\u00e9e, les policiers ont appel\u00e9 des renforts et, peu apr\u00e8s, deux autres v\u00e9hicules de police sont arriv\u00e9s sur les lieux. Le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sents dans l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval au cours de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n[93] Le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 leur arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la Gare centrale en provenance d\u2019Ottawa ils avaient l\u2019habitude d\u2019attendre que les autres passagers soient descendus du train avant de descendre. Le plaignant a reconnu qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas marcher tr\u00e8s vite en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. De la plate-forme du train jusqu\u2019au principal hall de la gare, il prenait l\u2019ascenseur \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il [Traduction] \u00e9vitait toujours d\u2019emprunter les escaliers lorsque c\u2019\u00e9tait possible. Il a en outre ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de quitter la Gare centrale il se rendait aux toilettes publiques et lorsqu\u2019il en sortait son petit\u2011fils l\u2019accompagnait \u00e0 son v\u00e9hicule.\n[94] Mme Schecter a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la [Traduction] descente de train le 7 juin 2001 avait pris de 7 \u00e0 10 minutes. Donc, lorsqu\u2019ils sont descendus du train, qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 17 h 15, et qu\u2019ils ont mont\u00e9 l\u2019escalier roulant, il devait \u00eatre presque 17 h 25. Le plaignant s\u2019est alors rendu aux toilettes publiques et s\u2019est ensuite dirig\u00e9 vers l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval.\n[95] Selon la preuve du plaignant et celle de son \u00e9pouse, le 7 juin 2001, ils ont rencontr\u00e9 leur petit\u2011fils en haut de l\u2019escalier roulant. L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait voir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait nerveux bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas dit si elle lui avait \u00e0 ce moment demand\u00e9 la raison de sa nervosit\u00e9. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait alors rendu aux toilettes publiques accompagn\u00e9 de son petit\u2011fils.\n[96] La preuve de l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant quant \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 par la suite est int\u00e9ressante. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme suit : [Traduction] Il [le petit-fils] a march\u00e9 avec mon \u00e9poux jusqu\u2019aux toilettes publiques o\u00f9 nous avons laiss\u00e9 mon \u00e9poux et [mon] petit\u2011fils m\u2019a alors accompagn\u00e9e \u00e0 notre v\u00e9hicule o\u00f9 mon fils nous attendait [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] Pourquoi n\u2019a\u2011t\u2011elle pas attendu son \u00e9poux ou demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son petit\u2011fils de le faire compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tat de son \u00e9poux et du fait qu\u2019\u00e0 de nombreuses reprises au cours de son t\u00e9moignage elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son \u00e9poux d\u00e9pendait d\u2019elle pour ses d\u00e9placements? Elle n\u2019avait certainement pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre accompagn\u00e9e au v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve qu\u2019elle ne peut pas marcher seule. Elle a par la suite ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient [Traduction] compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9 le fait [qu\u2019ils avaient] laiss\u00e9 mon \u00e9poux aux toilettes publiques. Ce comportement est de fa\u00e7on certaine embarrassant compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage rendu au cours de l\u2019audience se rapportant \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019a le plaignant \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer sans aide. On aurait pu s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que Mme Schecter ou son petit\u2011fils ait attendu que le plaignant sorte des toilettes publiques.\n[97] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il est sorti des toilettes publiques, il n\u2019y avait l\u00e0 personne pour l\u2019aider. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019un [Traduction] jeune inconnu l\u2019avait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher jusqu\u2019au stationnement o\u00f9 il a remarqu\u00e9 que son petit\u2011fils \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu dans un fourgon de police. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a fait appel aux policiers qui, \u00e0 sa demande, ont rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 son petit\u2011fils.\n[98] La preuve du plaignant et celle de son \u00e9pouse ne correspondent pas \u00e0 la preuve de M. Geoffroy. Selon son compte rendu, ni Marshall Schecter ni son fils n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 entrer dans la Gare centrale le 7 juin 2001. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le jeune Schecter avait, avant que les policiers arrivent, essay\u00e9 d\u2019entrer dans la Gare centrale, mais qu\u2019on l\u2019avait emp\u00each\u00e9 de le faire. Il a de plus mentionn\u00e9 dans son compte rendu que le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s ensemble \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e principale du stationnement South Plaza juste au moment o\u00f9 les deux autres v\u00e9hicules de police arrivaient sur les lieux.\n[99] Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de cris et que son coll\u00e8gue et lui se tenaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart et laissaient les policiers s\u2019occuper de la situation. \u00c0 un moment, il a remarqu\u00e9 que le plaignant parlait \u00e0 l\u2019un des policiers relativement \u00e0 la situation touchant son petit\u2011fils. Les policiers ont remis le petit-fils aux soins de son grand\u2011p\u00e8re \u00e0 environ 17 h 30. M. Geoffroy a ajout\u00e9 que Marshall Schecter s\u2019est alors tourn\u00e9 vers lui et lui a dit : [Traduction] Vous allez payer pour cela.\n[100] Le plaignant a en outre t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 un certain moment on l\u2019a fait monter dans une voiture ou un fourgon de la police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al. Il a en outre t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait partie au volant de leur v\u00e9hicule et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 sur place avec son fils et son petit\u2011fils.\n[101] L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que son \u00e9poux [Traduction] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 comme un objet inutile par le gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du CN lui avait ordonn\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer son v\u00e9hicule et de le stationner \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval. Encore une fois, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un commentaire int\u00e9ressant compte tenu du fait qu\u2019au cours du contre\u2011interrogatoire, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle se rappelait o\u00f9 le v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 le 7 juin 2001, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] Comment puis\u2011je me rappeler? Lorsque je suis arriv\u00e9e, je n\u2019ai jamais vu un v\u00e9hicule. J\u2019ai seulement vu des policiers qui se disputaient et qui poussaient. Par la suite, elle a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Je sais que le v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u2014 je ne l\u2019ai pas vu pr\u00e8s du fer \u00e0 cheval. Il \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 beaucoup plus loin parce que l\u2019altercation se passait pr\u00e8s de l\u2019entr\u00e9e. [\u2026] Je n\u2019ai pas vu le v\u00e9hicule l\u00e0, alors il devait \u00eatre plus loin [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]. Si elle avait d\u00fb d\u00e9placer le v\u00e9hicule comme elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, elle devait savoir o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9.\n[102] Ce que le plaignant se souvient quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits par la suite c\u2019est qu\u2019un v\u00e9hicule de police l\u2019avait ensuite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait all\u00e9e stationner le v\u00e9hicule. Il ne pouvait pas se souvenir o\u00f9 son \u00e9pouse avait stationn\u00e9 le v\u00e9hicule ou comment les policiers savaient o\u00f9 elle avait stationn\u00e9 le v\u00e9hicule. L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que son \u00e9poux l\u2019avait rejointe environ une demi-heure plus tard dans un v\u00e9hicule de police, mais elle n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle avait stationn\u00e9 le v\u00e9hicule ou comment les policiers avaient su o\u00f9 la trouver. Elle a alors dit qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 la Gare centrale pour aller chercher son fils et son petit\u2011fils.\n[103] Cette preuve ne correspond pas \u00e0 ce dont se souvient M. Geoffroy quant \u00e0 cet incident. Selon son compte rendu, le v\u00e9hicule de M. Schecter \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9 exactement au m\u00eame endroit durant toute la confrontation et il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9 par qui que ce soit. Il a en outre ajout\u00e9 que tous les membres de la famille sont partis ensemble dans le v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 17 h 35.\n[104] Le 12 juin 2001, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite quant \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 le 7 juin 2001. Dans cette d\u00e9claration, elle ne mentionne nullement l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou l\u2019un de ses employ\u00e9s ou le fait que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un v\u00e9hicule de police. Cela est tr\u00e8s surprenant si on tient compte de son t\u00e9moignage lors de l\u2019audience selon lequel ils avaient [Traduction] \u00e9t\u00e9 empoign\u00e9s par des gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et non par des policiers, selon lequel [Traduction] ils ont pouss\u00e9 mon \u00e9poux [\u2026] dans un fourgon cellulaire et selon lequel les gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [Traduction] [l]\u2019avaient \u00e9cart\u00e9 comme un objet inutile. On se serait attendu, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de ces accusations, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle les mentionne dans ses notes \u00e9crites. Cependant, il n\u2019y a nulle part dans ces notes une mention de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se rapportant \u00e0 son \u00e9poux et aux gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[105] Il est en outre important de mentionner qu\u2019il n\u2019y a nulle part dans le formulaire de plainte une mention de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se rapportant au plaignant. Au contraire, on a l\u2019impression en lisant la plainte que l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du plaignant dans l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval avait eu un certain effet apaisant. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare dans sa plainte ce qui suit : [Traduction] Dans l\u2019intervalle, lorsque je suis sorti des toilettes publiques, il n\u2019y avait l\u00e0 personne pour m\u2019aider. Un jeune inconnu m\u2019a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher jusqu\u2019au stationnement o\u00f9 j\u2019ai vu mon petit\u2011fils qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu dans un fourgon de police. J\u2019ai alors fait appel \u00e0 un policier de la CUM et, \u00e0 ma demande, mon petit\u2011fils a \u00e9t\u00e9 rel\u00e2ch\u00e9. La plainte est ensuite r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit : [Traduction] J\u2019estime que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 mon endroit en omettant de fournir des places de stationnement d\u00e9sign\u00e9es express\u00e9ment pour des v\u00e9hicules affichant une vignette de stationnement pour personne handicap\u00e9e. En raison du manque d\u2019accommodation, mon \u00e9pouse, Irma Schecter, et mon fils, Marshall Schecter, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9s et mon petit\u2011fils, Myles Schecter, a \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9 [\u2026]. Encore une fois, la plainte ne mentionne pas que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 agress\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[106] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Irma Schecter selon lequel des gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont bouscul\u00e9 et \u00e9cart\u00e9 son \u00e9poux n\u2019est aucunement fond\u00e9 et n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 par la preuve.\nV. La d\u00e9cision [107] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par son omission d\u2019avoir offert aux membres de sa famille et \u00e0 lui\u2011m\u00eame une accommodation quant \u00e0 ses installations, s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi).\n[108] L\u2019article 5 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\nd\u2019en priver un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[109] De nombreuses d\u00e9cisions ont mentionn\u00e9 que la Loi devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale compatible avec son statut quasi constitutionnel et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui assure la r\u00e9alisation de ses objectifs. L\u2019objet de la Loi est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[110] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 547, la Cour supr\u00eame a trait\u00e9 de la question de l\u2019objet de la loi en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nLes r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation accept\u00e9es sont suffisamment souples pour permettre \u00e0 la Cour de reconna\u00eetre, en interpr\u00e9tant un code des droits de la personne, la nature et l\u2019objet sp\u00e9ciaux de ce texte l\u00e9gislatif [\u2026] et de lui donner une interpr\u00e9tation qui permettra de promouvoir ses fins g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Une loi de ce genre est d\u2019une nature sp\u00e9ciale. Elle n\u2019est pas vraiment de nature constitutionnelle, mais elle est certainement d\u2019une nature qui sort de l\u2019ordinaire. Il appartient aux tribunaux d\u2019en rechercher l\u2019objet et de le mettre en application. Le Code vise la suppression de la discrimination. C\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence. Toutefois, sa fa\u00e7on principale de proc\u00e9der consiste non pas \u00e0 punir l\u2019auteur de la discrimination, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 offrir une voie de recours aux victimes de la discrimination. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[111] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, la Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 8 :\nSuivant son art. 2, la Loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet au principe selon lequel tous ont droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement, ind\u00e9pendamment de motifs de distinction illicites [\u2026]. [O]n doit interpr\u00e9ter la Loi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 promouvoir les consid\u00e9rations de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui la sous\u2011tendent.\n[112] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Loi devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour favoriser son objet; elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e comme un moyen de poursuivre une vengeance quant \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ne se rapportent pas \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire.\n[113] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la seule question \u00e0 trancher est celle de savoir si la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est une conduite qui constituait un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience. Il existe tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019affaires qui sont utiles pour trancher cette question parce que la grande majorit\u00e9 des affaires en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne r\u00e9sultent des situations d\u2019emploi et parce que tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019affaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de discrimination dans la fourniture de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[114] Dans l\u2019affaire Re Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission et al. et Canadian Odeon Theatres Limited, (1985) 18 D.L.R. 4th 93, le plaignant a achet\u00e9 un billet pour voir un film et est entr\u00e9 dans la salle de cin\u00e9ma, mais on lui a demand\u00e9 de s\u2019asseoir dans son fauteuil roulant \u00e0 l\u2019avant de la salle. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu du code des droits de la personne de la Saskatchewan all\u00e9guant de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un handicap physique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de services ou installations offerts au public. Un arbitre a rendu une d\u00e9cision favorable au plaignant. La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e en appel, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un autre appel interjet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan. Le jugement majoritaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le juge Vancise. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 la page 113 :\n[Traduction]\nLa question \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est celle de savoir si les installations pour le visionnement d\u2019un film offertes \u00e0 tous les membres du public, mais qui ont pour effet ou cons\u00e9quence pratique de faire de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019un ou plusieurs membres du public fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la d\u00e9ficience physique, constitue de la discrimination.\n[115] \u00c0 la page 115, il a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLe traitement d\u2019une personne de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle selon laquelle les autres personnes sont trait\u00e9es peut ou non \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 de la discrimination tout comme le fait de traiter des gens de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 la question en litige. Si l\u2019effet du traitement a des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables qui sont incompatibles avec les objets de la loi, par la restriction ou l\u2019exclusion du droit \u00e0 une reconnaissance enti\u00e8re et \u00e9gale et \u00e0 l\u2019exercice \u00e9gal et entier de ces droits, le traitement sera discriminatoire : voir \u00e9galement Re Rocca Group Ltd. and Muise (1979), 102 D.L.R. (3d) 529, 22 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 1; Post Office c. Union of Post Office Workers, [1974] 1 W.L.R. 89.\n[116] La discrimination dans un contexte des droits de la personne est l\u2019exclusion, la restriction ou la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans le traitement, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019une des nombreuses caract\u00e9ristiques s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es, dont le r\u00e9sultat est l\u2019emp\u00eachement ou la d\u00e9gradation de l\u2019exercice par les individus des droits et libert\u00e9s garantis par le code des droits de la personne. Pour d\u00e9cider si le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je dois n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9tablir l\u2019acte pr\u00e9cis ou les actes pr\u00e9cis qui, selon ce qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue, \u00e9taient discriminatoires ou qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 de la discrimination. Un examen de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et de la preuve d\u00e9montre manifestement que l\u2019acte pr\u00e9cis qui, selon ce qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue, constitue de la discrimination est le fait que le fils du plaignant n\u2019avait pas pu stationner son v\u00e9hicule dans l\u2019aire en fer \u00e0 cheval de la Gare centrale afin d\u2019attendre son p\u00e8re qui devait arriver d\u2019Ottawa en train. La question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est celle de savoir si la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e envers le plaignant, une personne handicap\u00e9e, lui inflige un traitement restrictif, nuisible ou pr\u00e9judiciable. Si oui, la conduite est discriminatoire et contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[117] Une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Loi afin de s\u2019assurer que son objet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 est atteint. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est n\u00e9cessaire, afin de d\u00e9cider si le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination, d\u2019\u00e9tablir si l\u2019installation ou le service qui lui \u00e9tait offert \u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on importante diff\u00e9rent de ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e offrait au public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est n\u00e9gative. Le service offert au plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de fa\u00e7on importante diff\u00e9rent du service offert au public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La preuve montre que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 entrer dans l\u2019espace en fer \u00e0 cheval, d\u2019y stationner pendant un certain temps afin de descendre ou de monter de son v\u00e9hicule. La preuve montre qu\u2019il l\u2019avait fait \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises et, selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant lui\u2011m\u00eame, il n\u2019avait jamais eu d\u2019exp\u00e9riences malheureuses \u00e0 la Gare centrale \u00e0 ces occasions. Ce qui \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent le 7 juin 2001, c\u2019\u00e9tait la pr\u00e9sence des policiers. La question alors est la suivante : Pourquoi ces policiers \u00e9taient\u2011ils pr\u00e9sents dans le fer \u00e0 cheval cette soir\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0?\n[118] La seule r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est l\u2019ent\u00eatement du fils du plaignant. Il n\u2019y avait pas de raison pour le fils du plaignant de refuser de d\u00e9placer son v\u00e9hicule lorsque le gardien se s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s\u2019est d\u2019abord approch\u00e9 de lui. Son p\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans le v\u00e9hicule et il n\u2019attendait pas non plus pour monter dans le v\u00e9hicule. Le fils du plaignant aurait pu \u00e0 ce moment d\u00e9placer le v\u00e9hicule et envoyer son fils \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la Gare centrale pour qu\u2019il y rencontre ses parents. Il aurait pu revenir plus tard \u00e0 la Gare centrale pour venir chercher ses parents. La seule raison pour laquelle il a refus\u00e9 de le faire \u00e9tait qu\u2019il estimait que cela ne lui convenait pas et son refus n\u2019avait pas de liens avec la d\u00e9ficience de son p\u00e8re. S\u2019il croyait effectivement de fa\u00e7on raisonnable que les gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 agissaient de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire, il aurait d\u00fb se rendre compte que la confrontation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la solution. Il aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9placer son v\u00e9hicule et d\u00e9poser par la suite aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es une plainte au nom de son p\u00e8re.\n[119] Sa d\u00e9cision de rester sur place et d\u2019affronter les gardiens de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s peu judicieuse. Elle d\u00e9montrait de plus un trait de son caract\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience et corrobor\u00e9 par d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s col\u00e9reux. Cette caract\u00e9ristique du comportement du t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9e par M. Jacques Perron, avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience, de m\u00eame que dans une Note au dossier \u00e9crite par M. Charles Unterburg de la Commission.\n[120] Le plaignant a malheureusement fait face \u00e0 ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, mais il ne peut d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on en attribuer les cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s. Le plaignant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience aucune preuve au soutien d\u2019une conclusion en ce sens. Ma conclusion aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en entier sa cause et s\u2019il avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un contre\u2011interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Malheureusement pour lui, la preuve dont je dispose n\u2019appuie pas sa demande.\n[121] Compte tenu des pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, je ne peux pas conclure, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a fait dans la d\u00e9cision Association canadienne des parapl\u00e9giques c. Canada (\u00c9lections Canada), 1992 CanLII 284 (T.C.D.P.), que les actes pos\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont discriminatoires. Je ne peux pas conclure qu\u2019il y a eu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une diff\u00e9rence dans le traitement au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Je ne peux pas conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait responsable de tout embarras, risque de blessure ou inconv\u00e9nient pour le plaignant. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime d\u2019un ensemble de circonstances qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec la discrimination, du moins selon la preuve dont je dispose.\nVI.

INTRODUCTION [1] On all\u00e8gue dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte qu'Eldon Warman a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) en affichant dans Internet des messages antis\u00e9mites. Le 27 avril 2005, au cours de l'audience, j'ai rendu la d\u00e9cision suivante quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9.\n[Traduction]\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT :\n[...] J'ai examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que la jurisprudence soumis par la Commission. Je suis convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve constituent des communications provenant d'Eldon Warman au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nMon r\u00f4le n'est pas de r\u00e9glementer le libre \u00e9change des id\u00e9es. Il existe peut-\u00eatre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de d\u00e9bat politique l\u00e9gitime dans les messages d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve et l'intim\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 ses opinions. Toutefois, un certain nombre des messages affich\u00e9s d\u00e9passent les param\u00e8tres juridiques du d\u00e9bat public et contreviennent aux dispositions de la Loi.\n\u00c0 mon avis, ce sont les sentiments exprim\u00e9s dans ces messages qui posent probl\u00e8me. Les messages affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 expriment une haine flagrante envers les Juifs. Ils rabaissent et diffament les Juifs. Ils fomentent la haine et le m\u00e9pris. Ils frappent au cur de la dignit\u00e9 de tout \u00eatre humain et pr\u00e9judicient \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nJe suis convaincu du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte et je remettrai les motifs \u00e9crits aux parties \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\nNous avons donc une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. Je crois que, sur le plan de l'ordonnance, je vais passer \u00e0 l'ordonnance, puis, j'entendrai la Commission.\nL'ORDONNANCE DU TRIBUNAL\nJ'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu les parties quant \u00e0 l'indemnisation et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l'on fasse d'autres observations quant \u00e0 la demande visant \u00e0 obtenir la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) et de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9livrer une ordonnance suivant les modalit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, paragraphe 83.\nPar les pr\u00e9sentes, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, Eldon Warman, lequel s'est identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant Eldon-Gerald de la famille Warman, de mettre fin \u00e0 sa pratique discriminatoire, qui consiste \u00e0 afficher dans Internet des messages ou autres documents susceptibles d'exposer les Juifs ou tout autre membre d'un groupe identifiable, qu'il soit racial, religieux ou ethnique, \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nJe demande \u00e0 la Commission de m'accorder une ordonnance officielle. (T. 344)\n[2] J'ai remis \u00e0 plus tard le prononc\u00e9 de ma d\u00e9cision sur la question de la sanction et j'ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je leur fournirais des motifs \u00e9crits \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\nA. La signification [3] La Commission et le Tribunal ont signifi\u00e9 maintes fois \u00e0 Eldon Warman des documents ayant trait \u00e0 l'audience. Celui-ci a continuellement \u00e9vit\u00e9 la signification. Un tableau exposant les d\u00e9tails des nombreuses tentatives de signification \u00e0 M. Warman a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 pendant l'audience comme pi\u00e8ce T-5. La pi\u00e8ce T-5 est jointe en annexe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[4] Un ensemble de documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 au Tribunal le 20 avril 2005. Il comprend un AVIS qui mentionne notamment ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nIl semble que ces documents soient importants pour vous, alors je vous les retourne intacts et non ouverts. S'ils m'\u00e9taient destin\u00e9s, je refuse par les pr\u00e9sentes votre offre de contrat, ou de tout contrat pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, concernant votre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 droit de comp\u00e9tence sur ma personne.\n[5] Dans ce m\u00eame avis, Eldon Warman conteste l'utilisation de son nom et d\u00e9clare que la personne \u00e0 laquelle on renvoie dans son certificat de naissance est une fiction juridique, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne du chef de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick.\n[6] Le 31 mars 2005, Eldon Warman s'est fait personnellement signifier des documents par la Commission. Cette signification a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une sorte d'altercation. Dans son affidavit, l'huissier d\u00e9clare qu'il a signifi\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 Eldon Warman puis qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'\u00e9loigner.\n[Traduction]\nL'intim\u00e9 s'est alors empar\u00e9 d'une roche qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s grosse comme sa main. Je me suis retourn\u00e9 et je l'ai pr\u00e9venu que s'il me touchait je porterais des accusations de voies de fait contre lui. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Vous ne pouvez pas porter d'accusation de voies de fait contre moi parce que je vais vous tuer. J'ai alors couru jusqu'\u00e0 ma voiture, puis j'ai quitt\u00e9 le secteur.\nCe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de semble refl\u00e9ter l'attitude de M. Warman envers la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[7] Dans un autre affidavit, il est mentionn\u00e9 que le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 huit reprises de signifier personnellement des documents \u00e0 Eldon Warman. J'ai par la suite d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une ordonnance autorisant la signification substitutive. \u00c0 plusieurs reprises, des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9s sur la porte principale de la r\u00e9sidence de M. Warman. Je suis convaincu qu'Eldon Warman est au courant de l'existence de la pr\u00e9sente instance et qu'il a choisi de ne pas y participer.\n[8] Les tentatives de signification \u00e0 Eldon Warman se sont poursuivies apr\u00e8s que la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 fut tranch\u00e9e. J'ai insist\u00e9 pour que la Commission signifie un avis \u00e0 Eldon Warman qu'elle demandait une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 10 000 $ en vertu du paragraphe 54(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Bien que la Commission fut incapable de mener \u00e0 bien la signification personnelle, cet avis, ainsi que mon ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir, furent coll\u00e9s \u00e0 l'aide d'un ruban adh\u00e9sif \u00e0 la porte de M. Warman.\n[9] Je crois que la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce est plus qu'une simple tentative de se soustraire \u00e0 la signification. Il s'agit vraiment d'une question de reconnaissance. Selon la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce, Eldon Warman refuse d'accepter la comp\u00e9tence des cours de justice ainsi que celle des autres institutions juridiques au Canada. Je crois qu'il est clair qu'il n'accepte pas la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en la mati\u00e8re.\nII. LES FAITS A. L'historique [10] Le plaignant, Richard Warman, n'a aucun lien de parent\u00e9 avec l'intim\u00e9. Il a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que, depuis 15 ans il fait campagne contre la propagande haineuse. Il y a environ cinq ans, il a concentr\u00e9 ses efforts sur Internet. Bien qu'il ne soit pas reconnu comme un expert, je lui ai permis de donner certains renseignements quant aux documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[11] Richard Warman a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il existe un mouvement appel\u00e9 [Traduction] homme libre ou [Traduction] citoyens souverains. La pens\u00e9e de ce mouvement comporte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du Posse Commitatus. Ses promoteurs croient que la seule source l\u00e9gitime de pouvoir se situe au niveau r\u00e9gional. Cela a donn\u00e9 naissance au mouvement De-tax, lequel croit que les imp\u00f4ts \u00e9tablis par le gouvernement sont contraires \u00e0 la loi. On estime dans ce mouvement que l'imposition contrevient \u00e0 la Grande Charte.\n[12] Eldon Warman est un personnage influent du mouvement De-tax. Il a re\u00e7u une certaine attention de la part des m\u00e9dias et il a donn\u00e9 des s\u00e9minaires qui expliquent pourquoi personne n'est tenu de payer des imp\u00f4ts. La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'il exploite un site Web appel\u00e9 \u00a9Detax Canada\u00ae dans lequel il donne des conseils aux gens sur la fa\u00e7on de cesser de payer des imp\u00f4ts [Traduction] de fa\u00e7on permanente, efficace, l\u00e9gale. On trouve ce site Web \u00e0 l'adresse suivante : www.detaxcanada.org.\n[13] Ce site Web fait la promotion d'un libertarianisme radical, lequel situe les droits individuels au dessus de l'engagement moral du gouvernement. Le site Web englobe un m\u00e9lange d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de moralit\u00e9, de droit et de politique et il exhorte les gens \u00e0 ne pas payer d'imp\u00f4t, \u00e0 refaire du Canada [Traduction] un pays libre et \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir les [Traduction] DROITS INDIVIDUELS sacr\u00e9s des Canadiens. Un certain nombre des messages sont plut\u00f4t banals, comme par exemple la qualification de l'ADRC, l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada, de bande de [Traduction] sales cannibales et d'animaux enrag\u00e9s.\n[14] Le site Web conteste la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me juridique. Il est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans l'un des encadr\u00e9s de la page d'accueil :\nVOUS \u00caTES VICTIME DE HAUTE TRAHISON\nLes juges constituent l'un des principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette TRAHISON envers les Canadiens\nLes juges canadiens utilisent un [Traduction] guide du mouvement antigouvernemental con\u00e7u par les Am\u00e9ricains dans le but de priver les citoyens canadiens souverains de leurs droits sacr\u00e9s au sein du syst\u00e8me judiciaire canadien, lequel est en fait contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par la finance - contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par le Inner Temple de la City de Londres, une entit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re ennemie.\n[15] La menace est palpable. Il est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans un autre encadr\u00e9 : [Traduction] Vous avez le droit de vous servir de la force meurtri\u00e8re pour mettre fin \u00e0 ces actes illicites dont vous \u00eates victimes. On \u00e9met la sombre id\u00e9e que la souverainet\u00e9 de la population doit \u00eatre restaur\u00e9e.\n[16] Une section du site Web est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'une [Traduction] Magna Carta canadienne qui \u00e9num\u00e8rerait les [Traduction] griefs de la population canadienne. On y pr\u00e9tend ce qui suit : le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les gouvernements provinciaux sont [Traduction] ill\u00e9gitimes, la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 [Traduction] est une v\u00e9ritable FRAUDE, les Canadiens [Traduction] ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9s en esclaves des grandes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales par la [Traduction] dette \u00e9crasante de ces gouvernements, laquelle repose [Traduction] sur de la fausse monnaie emprunt\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de banquiers \u00e9trangers.\n[17] Il semble que le discours antis\u00e9mite commence \u00e0 partir de l\u00e0. On pr\u00e9tend, dans le m\u00eame document, que les [Traduction] voyous des banques de la City de Londres ont usurp\u00e9 le pouvoir qui revient \u00e0 la Couronne britannique et se servent du syst\u00e8me d'imposition pour se g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus. Il ressort d'autres documents que l'expression voyous des banques fait allusion aux int\u00e9r\u00eats juifs. On pr\u00e9tend, toujours dans le site Web, que notre gouvernement a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrompu par un complot illicite mont\u00e9 par les juifs et les francs-ma\u00e7ons.\n[18] Je veux \u00eatre \u00e9quitable. Dans le site Web, on tente de s\u00e9parer ce genre de th\u00e9orie du complot de toute opinion raciale, ethnique ou religieuse. Une phrase dans le site mentionne ce qui suit : [Traduction] Je n'ai aucune animosit\u00e9 envers quelque groupe ethnique, racial ou religieux que ce soit, au Canada ou ailleurs.\nB. Les messages affich\u00e9s [19] La preuve de fond contre Eldon Warman a principalement consist\u00e9 en copies de courriels affich\u00e9s sur des sites publics. Ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis par le plaignant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'utilisation de moteurs de recherche. Un certain nombre de ces messages figuraient dans des babillards et dans des groupes de discussion, class\u00e9s par sujet. Un certain nombre des messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9s dans un article de discussion et coll\u00e9s dans un autre.\n[20] Le nom d'Eldon Warman figure dans les messages affich\u00e9s. L'identit\u00e9 de l'auteur des messages peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e des adresses de retour ainsi que de la teneur des messages. Les premiers messages faisaient mention de deux adresses : egwarman@hotmail.com et warmael@hotmail.com. Eldon Warman utilisait cette derni\u00e8re adresse lorsqu'il a inscrit le site Web www.detaxcanada.org dans le registre de nom de domaines whois. Une troisi\u00e8me adresse est mentionn\u00e9e dans les derniers messages, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 partir de 2002 : egwarman@outgun.com. Cette adresse figure dans le site Web Detax.\n[21] Les messages vont tous dans le m\u00eame sens. L'auteur utilise le m\u00eame langage et retourne \u00e0 maintes reprises aux m\u00eames th\u00e8mes. Je crois que, \u00e0 partir de la multitude de sources dont je suis saisi, en l'absence de tout autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, je peux tirer la conclusion qu'Eldon Warman est l'auteur de ces messages. Ce serait pure sp\u00e9culation que de conclure autrement.\n[22] Les messages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve d\u00e9crivent les Juifs comme des ennemis. Eldon Warman attribue la responsabilit\u00e9 de certains maux au peuple juif. Ces maux vont des cliniques d'avortement au g\u00e9nocide du Rwanda. On y fait des allusions m\u00e9prisantes \u00e0 la tradition juive. Le Talmud est qualifi\u00e9 de [Traduction] litt\u00e9rature haineuse et d'[Traduction] inf\u00e2me d\u00e9chet du rabbin de la synagogue de Satan.\n[23] La plupart des messages proviennent de conversations \u00e9lectroniques qui ont eu lieu dans Internet. Eldon Warman r\u00e9pond ce qui suit \u00e0 une personne, un fonctionnaire peut-\u00eatre :\n[Traduction]\nAlors, toi, sale TRA\u00ceTRE de B\u00c2TARD de juif sioniste - que penses-tu de \u00e7a pour un anti\u00e9domite, ou [...] un antis\u00e9mite, si tu pr\u00e9f\u00e8res [...] si tu repr\u00e9sentes ce qu'on appelle un s\u00e9mite, alors tu peux me croire que je suis un antis\u00e9mite [...] que je ne tol\u00e8re aucunement les d\u00e9chets de JUIFS ASSASSINS NAZIS SIONISTES, comme toi Freddie. Un cr\u00e9tin qui s'\u00e9vertue \u00e0 tenter de garder les Canadiens en esclavage et \u00e0 d\u00e9truire les Canadiens ainsi que leurs familles.\nDe nombreux propos haineux figurent dans ce message.\n[24] Eldon Warman d\u00e9grade le peuple juif. Dans un autre message, il r\u00e9pond ce qui suit \u00e0 un correspondant :\nCriswell, continue de fourrer des petits p\u00e9d\u00e9s, comme bon juif sioniste que, de toute \u00e9vidence, tu es.\n[25] Un autre correspondant affirme qu'Eldon Warman est un malade mental. Celui-ci r\u00e9pond ce qui suit au correspondant :\n[Traduction]\nIl semble que je fasse vraiment chier aux Juifs leur MERDE DE COCHON au lieu de faire ce qu'ils font de mieux, c'est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9clarer cacher et la manger [...] Et, puissent leurs b\u00e9b\u00e9s se faire \u00e9gorger dans leurs cliniques d'avortement juives.\nLe ton des messages est d\u00e9shumanisant.\n[26] Le message le plus troublant se trouve \u00e0 la page 131 de la transcription :\n[Traduction]\nMME PHILLIPS : Lisez donc le dernier paragraphe, M. Warman.\n[RICHARD] WARMAN : Le dernier paragraphe est ainsi formul\u00e9 :\nJoe le Juif, merci de rappeler aux Canadiens et aux Am\u00e9ricains de lire et de se rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire quant \u00e0 ce que vous, les JUIFS NAZIS SIONISTES avez fait aux Am\u00e9ricains. C'est dommage que nous n'ayons pas davantage besoin de savon et d'abat-jour, mais, je suppose qu'il serait difficile de faire sortir la puanteur de merde de cochon de cette graisse d\u00e9gueulasse.\nEldon Warman\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Soyons clairs. De quelle citation s'agit-il? - Je crois que je comprend. Il s'agit d'une autre personne qui a affich\u00e9 un message qu'Eldon Warman avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 envoy\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9? Il semble que ce soit cela.\nMME PHILLIPS : Il me semble que Joe, cette personne qui a \u00e9crit un long courriel, a affich\u00e9 dans la suite th\u00e9matique de ce babillard un message qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 par M. Warman et il l'a port\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 l'attention des personnes qui discutent actuellement sur le babillard pour leur donner une id\u00e9e du genre de personne qu'est M. Eldon Warman, puis, \u00e0 la partie que M. Richard Warman vient tout juste de lire, M. Eldon Warman remercie Joe pour avoir fait ce rappel aux Canadiens.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Donc, une sorte de d\u00e9bat ou de discussion a lieu et une personne retourne en arri\u00e8re et affiche ce message qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement par Eldon Warman - et voil\u00e0 ce qu'\u00e9tait son message - puis, \u00e9videmment, M. Eldon Warman revient et r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce message particulier. Je crois que je comprends\nM. [RICHARD] WARMAN : Oui.\nCe message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1999. Il \u00e9tait dat\u00e9 du 8 mai 2002.\n[27] J'ai permis \u00e0 Richard Warman d'expliquer qu'Eldon Warman faisait allusion au fait que l'on fabriquait des abat-jour ainsi que du savon avec les corps des Juifs morts dans les camps de concentration du Troisi\u00e8me Reich. Eldon Warman exploitait manifestement les associations de ce genre afin de d\u00e9montrer jusqu'\u00e0 quel point il est fid\u00e8le \u00e0 ses opinions politiques. S'il avait besoin d'insinuations racistes pour faire avancer son programme politique, il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 les utiliser.\n[28] Il y a des passages dans lesquels Eldon Warman nie \u00eatre raciste. Il tente souvent de se prot\u00e9ger des accusations de racisme en faisant une distinction entre Juifs et Juifs sionistes. Dans l'un de ses messages, il affirme que sa vie ne tourne pas autour de la haine des Juifs et il tient les propos qui suivent :\n[Traduction]\n[...] J'ai tr\u00e8s peur pour mes petits enfants ainsi que pour le monde dans lequel ils doivent tenter de mener une vie utile - et non pas de mener une vie d'esclaves des voyous des banques juifs sionistes.\n[29] Un certain nombre des messages comprennent des commentaires politiques l\u00e9gitimes. Ils sont toutefois remplis d'injures. Eldon Warman parle de [Traduction] George Bush, le Fuhrer non \u00e9lu des \u00c9tats-Unis enjuiv\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant le chef d'une [Traduction] bande de voyous NAZIS en uniforme.\n[30] Je constate le d\u00e9but d'une nuance ici, mais cela n'a pas d'importance. Il y a un programme raciste dans les messages. Je crois qu'il est impossible de s\u00e9parer l'attitude d'Eldon Warman envers les Juifs sionistes de son antipathie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale envers le peuple juif. Les messages incitent \u00e0 la haine.\nIII. LA RESPONSABILIT\u00c9 A. Interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [31] Le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n13. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne [...] d'utiliser [...] un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e [...] pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 [motifs de distinction illicite].\nLe paragraphe 13(2) \u00e9tend le champ d'application de cette disposition aux communications dans Internet.\n[32] Il me semble qu'il est erron\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne comme une restriction l\u00e9gale ind\u00e9pendante. Cet article a pour objet d'imposer un certain nombre de limites n\u00e9cessaires et raisonnables \u00e0 notre libert\u00e9 d'expression. Il circonscrit notre libert\u00e9. Cela est important pour les fins de l'analyse car cela signifie qu'un tribunal qui applique l'article doit se fonder sur la pr\u00e9misse que les personnes peuvent s'exprimer librement. Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer les limites de cette libert\u00e9.\n[33] Il est clair que cette libert\u00e9 d'expression fait partie du droit fondamental. L'article 19 de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme (A.G. R\u00e9s. 217 A (III), Doc. A\/810 N.U. (1948)) d\u00e9clare que tout individu a le droit de recevoir et de r\u00e9pandre, sans consid\u00e9ration de fronti\u00e8re, les informations et les id\u00e9es par quelque moyen d'expression que ce soit. Le paragraphe 19(2) du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques (19 d\u00e9cembre 1966, 999 R.T.N.U. 171) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n19(2) Toute personne a droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression; ce droit comprend la libert\u00e9 de rechercher, de recevoir et de r\u00e9pandre des informations et des id\u00e9es de toute esp\u00e8ce, sans consid\u00e9ration de fronti\u00e8res, sous une forme orale, \u00e9crite, imprim\u00e9e ou artistique, ou par tout autre moyen de son choix.\nLe paragraphe 19(3) soumet ces libert\u00e9s \u00e0 certaines restrictions qui sont n\u00e9cessaires au respect des droits ou de la r\u00e9putation d'autrui.\n[34] Le droit interne utilise le m\u00eame paradigme. Ce concept de libert\u00e9 d'expression a toujours occup\u00e9 une place importante dans notre tradition d\u00e9mocratique. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ench\u00e2ss\u00e9 \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s qui est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n2. Chacun a les libert\u00e9s fondamentales suivantes :\nb) libert\u00e9 de pens\u00e9e, de croyance, d'opinion et d'expression, y compris la libert\u00e9 de la presse et des autres moyens de communication;\n[35] Dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, la Cour supr\u00eame a reconnu que l'article 13 contrevenait \u00e0 cette disposition. Il s'agit toutefois d'une limite raisonnable au sens de l'article premier de la Charte dont la justification peut se d\u00e9montrer dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n[36] J'estime tout simplement qu'un tribunal qui applique l'article 13 de la Charte canadienne des droits de la personne a la t\u00e2che d\u00e9licate de d\u00e9terminer les limites de nos libert\u00e9s fondamentales. Cet exercice exige que l'on soup\u00e8se avec soin les valeurs constitutionnelles menac\u00e9es par cette application. Je ne crois pas que j'exag\u00e8re lorsque j'affirme qu'un tribunal ayant omis de tenir compte des facteurs constitutionnels qui entrent en jeu dans cet exercice a probablement mal appliqu\u00e9 l'article 13.\n(i) Le droit interdisant les messages haineux [37] Le m\u00e9canisme juridique qui trouve son expression dans l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne prend sa source dans le droit international. L'article 7 de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n7. Tous sont \u00e9gaux devant la loi et ont droit sans distinction \u00e0 une \u00e9gale protection de la loi. Tous ont droit \u00e0 une protection \u00e9gale contre toute discrimination qui violerait la pr\u00e9sente D\u00e9claration et contre toute provocation \u00e0 une telle discrimination.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que certaines personnes ne m\u00e9ritent pas un traitement \u00e9gal contrevient \u00e0 ce genre de disposition.\n[38] Il existe une loi qui interdit les d\u00e9clarations qui r\u00e9pandent la haine. Le paragraphe 20(2) du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n20(2) Tout appel \u00e0 la haine nationale, raciale ou religieuse qui constitue une incitation \u00e0 la discrimination, \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la violence est interdit par la loi.\nL'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne tombe sous les auspices de cet article.\n[39] L'alin\u00e9a 4a) de la Convention internationale sur l'\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale (21 d\u00e9c. 1965, 66 R.T.N.U. 195) est plus explicite. Il exige que les \u00c9tats parties s'engagent notamment :\n4a) \u00c0 d\u00e9clarer d\u00e9lits punissables par la loi toute diffusion d'id\u00e9es sur la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 ou la haine raciale [...]\nLa Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue afin de faire respecter le principe de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. L'article 13 et les dispositions connexes r\u00e9alisent cet objectif en emp\u00eachant la fomentation de la haine et en retirant d'Internet les \u00e9l\u00e9ments offensants au sens juridique.\n[40] L'article 13 d\u00e9crit la communication de messages haineux comme \u00e9tant une forme de discrimination. Il y a des raisons \u00e0 cela. Les lois qui interdisent la diss\u00e9mination de la haine tirent leur origine du droit qu'ont les personnes de vivre sans \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la haine et \u00e0 l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9. Je crois que le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 la position que les bonnes relations qui constituent le fondement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile reposent sur la croyance que les personnes appartenant \u00e0 des groupes diff\u00e9rents sont \u00e9gales. Il s'agit-l\u00e0 d'un pr\u00e9cepte juridique et politique fondamental. Toute autre opinion est ill\u00e9gitime.\n(ii) Les exigences de l'article 13 [41] L'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne consiste \u00e0 retirer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'expression dangereux du d\u00e9bat public. Le retrait de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'expression du d\u00e9bat public favorise l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la tol\u00e9rance et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne. Il prot\u00e8ge \u00e9galement les membres des minorit\u00e9s du pr\u00e9judice psychologique caus\u00e9 par la diss\u00e9mination d'opinions raciales. Ces opinions sont in\u00e9vitablement source de pr\u00e9judice, de discrimination et risquent d'engendrer la violence physique.\n[42] Les mots exposer, haine et m\u00e9pris ont leur sens ordinaire et le seul commentaire que je ferais est que les pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la haine dans le contexte de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne d\u00e9coulent du fait que la haine \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres met en p\u00e9ril leur \u00e9galit\u00e9. Les messages interdits par l'article privent les victimes de leur dignit\u00e9 en tant que personne et justifient leur traitement in\u00e9gal. On ne peut pas tol\u00e9rer cela.\n[43] Le mot m\u00e9pris comprend cette association d'inf\u00e9riorit\u00e9. Il suffit que les documents soient susceptibles d'exposer une personne \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. On exige n\u00e9anmoins une certaine gravit\u00e9 pour justifier une violation de la libert\u00e9 d'expression. Je ne crois pas que l'article vise les propos frivoles ou sans cons\u00e9quence.\n[44] Je suis convaincu que les exigences de l'article ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites en l'esp\u00e8ce. La fr\u00e9quence des messages et la nature de leur affichage dans Internet suffisent \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 l'exigence voulant qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[45] Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement \u00e9viter de discuter de textes religieux. La libert\u00e9 de religion comprend la libert\u00e9 d'exprimer son d\u00e9saccord. J'ajouterais n\u00e9anmoins que la promulgation d'opinions qui favorisent une attitude m\u00e9prisante envers les textes religieux fondamentaux est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les groupes qui consid\u00e8rent ces textes comme \u00e9tant sacr\u00e9s.\n[46] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir. Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la Commission que le mat\u00e9riel a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 d'Internet. L'objet fondamental vis\u00e9 par la Loi a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9.\nIV. LA SANCTION P\u00c9CUNIAIRE [47] La Commission des droits de la personne demande \u00e9galement l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n54(1) Le membre instructeur qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte tombant sous le coup de l'article 13 peut rendre :\nc) une ordonnance imposant une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $.\nLa Commission demande l'imposition de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire maximale de 10 000 $.\n[48] Le paragraphe 54(1.1) \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte lorsqu'il examine la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 imposer en vertu de cette disposition.\n54(1.1) Il tient compte, avant d'imposer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire vis\u00e9e\n\u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)c) :\nde la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que des circonstances l'entourant; bde la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et de sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\nLa jurisprudence est trop limit\u00e9e pour que l'on puisse y trouver une orientation autre que celle que l'on trouve dans les dispositions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent.\nA. Les questions constitutionnelles [49] J'ai d'abord cru que les questions constitutionnelles soulev\u00e9es dans le cas de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es. Lorsque j'ai examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence, j'ai d\u00e9couvert que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n(i) Taylor [50] La constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, dans lequel celle-ci a conclu que l'article 13 visait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par les messages haineux. Ce n'est qu'en 1998 que la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e. Je ne vois rien dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor qui parle de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire.\n(ii) Z\u00fcndel [51] Le Tribunal a rendu deux d\u00e9cisions qui traitent de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13. La premi\u00e8re est Citron c. Z\u00fcndel, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 1. Toutefois, les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans Z\u00fcndel sont des remarques incidentes; toutefois, comme la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, le Tribunal a tout simplement statu\u00e9 que la disposition n'avait pas d'effet r\u00e9troactif.\n[52] Les opinions exprim\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans Z\u00fcndel quant au mandat qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 13 sont n\u00e9anmoins instructives. Au paragraphe 256, le Tribunal a conclu que les juges majoritaires dans Taylor ont \u00e9tabli une nette distinction entre une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et une infraction au Code criminel. Il a ensuite cit\u00e9 le passage suivant tir\u00e9 de l'arr\u00eat Taylor, page 917 :\nIl est essentiel [...] de reconna\u00eetre qu'en tant qu'outil express\u00e9ment con\u00e7u pour emp\u00eacher la propagation des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et pour favoriser la tol\u00e9rance et l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne diff\u00e8re nettement du Code criminel. La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, et en particulier le par. 13(1), n'a pas pour objet de faire exercer contre une personne fautive le plein pouvoir de l'\u00c9tat dans le but de lui infliger un ch\u00e2timent. Au contraire, les dispositions des lois sur les droits de la personne tendent plut\u00f4t, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 \u00e9viter ce genre d'affrontement en permettant autant que possible un r\u00e8glement par voie de conciliation et, lorsqu'il y a discrimination, en pr\u00e9voyant des redressements destin\u00e9s davantage \u00e0 indemniser la victime.\nJe crois que le Tribunal a eu raison de centrer son attention sur cet aspect de l'arr\u00eat Taylor.\n(iii) Schnell [53] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la question dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2002] T.C.D.P. no 21, laquelle fut rendue apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. L'argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sinclair \u00e9tait que l'introduction de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire avait compromis la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13. L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que l'article ne pouvait plus \u00eatre justifi\u00e9 au sens de l'article premier de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[54] Je partage l'avis du Tribunal dans Schnell que cet argument doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. M. Sinclair a conclu que l'adoption de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) a pouss\u00e9 l'article 13 plus pr\u00e8s de ses limites constitutionnelles. Il a n\u00e9anmoins estim\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Taylor n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9e par l'introduction de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'importance de la d\u00e9cision Schnell est qu'elle r\u00e9affirme la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'article 13.\n[55] Je crois que le point important dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte est que les deux dispositions sont s\u00e9parables. La disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire comporte peut-\u00eatre des vices, abstraction faite de l'article 13. Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois que les questions relatives \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es.\n[56] Il existe d'autres diff\u00e9rences. Dans Schnell, la Commission n'a demand\u00e9 aucune sanction p\u00e9cuniaire et le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d'exercer sa comp\u00e9tence sur ce fondement, il est donc permis de penser que l'affaire \u00e9tait devenue th\u00e9orique. M. Sinclair \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le peu de renseignements dont il disposait pour \u00e9tablir ce qui constitue une sanction convenable.\n[57] Je crois qu'une d\u00e9cision concernant la validit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) doit \u00eatre rendue dans une cause o\u00f9 un tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 imposer une sanction. Il y a plusieurs raisons \u00e0 cela, la principale \u00e9tant que, tant qu'il n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de l'imposer, il est impossible pour un membre d'appr\u00e9cier parfaitement l'importance d'une telle sanction. L'incompatibilit\u00e9 des opinions ne change rien \u00e0 cela.\n(iv) Kyburz [58] La seule cause dans laquelle le Tribunal a impos\u00e9 une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) est Warman c. Kyburz, [2003] T.C.D.P. no 18. La constitutionalit\u00e9 de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e dans cette cause. Cela est apparemment d\u00fb au fait que M. Kyburz n'a pas comparu.\n[59] La diff\u00e9rence entre la pr\u00e9sente cause et Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, est que je me sens oblig\u00e9 de porter les questions de ce genre \u00e0 l'attention des parties. Cela est peut-\u00eatre attribuable en partie au fait que les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce sont moins imp\u00e9rieuses que les circonstances dans Kyburz. Cela met en avant-plan la question de la Charte.\n[60] Je suis n\u00e9anmoins d'accord avec le Tribunal, dans Kyburz, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) am\u00e8ne le Tribunal bien \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des param\u00e8tres normaux de sa comp\u00e9tence. Le Tribunal a conclu ce qui suit au paragraphe 94 :\nLes indemnit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales accord\u00e9es en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des plaintes relevant de l'article 13 visent \u00e0 indemniser les personnes express\u00e9ment nomm\u00e9es dans les messages haineux. Par contraste, les sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires impos\u00e9es en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi se veulent l'expression de l'opprobre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du comportement de la partie intim\u00e9e.\nC'est la culpabilit\u00e9 morale du comportement de l'intim\u00e9 qui entra\u00eene la sanction.\n[61] Il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que, dans Kyburz, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'appliquer la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire sans utiliser le langage du droit criminel. Le Tribunal parle de la sanction comme une amende et qualifie la violation de la Loi par l'intim\u00e9 de premi\u00e8re infraction. Il est impossible d'\u00e9chapper aux corr\u00e9lations qui existent entre le processus de d\u00e9termination de la peine dans les cours criminelles et l'imposition d'une sanction en vertu du paragraphe 54(2).\n(v) Conclusions [62] Il ressort de mon examen de la jurisprudence que les questions concernant la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait que la disposition limite manifestement la libert\u00e9 d'expression garantie par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne. Le facteur qui distingue la pr\u00e9sente cause des autres causes est que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, les questions manifestes sont d'ordre constitutionnelle. Ces questions ressortent de la loi \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue.\n[63] Le probl\u00e8me est qu'Eldon Warman refuse de reconna\u00eetre la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, voire m\u00eame le syst\u00e8me juridique dans son ensemble. Il a choisi de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'instruction. Par cons\u00e9quent, les questions qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es.\n[64] Je ne peux dire que tr\u00e8s peu de chose \u00e0 ce propos. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu'Eldon Warman devait accepter les cons\u00e9quences de sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas participer. Il ne devrait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9compens\u00e9 pour avoir omis de compara\u00eetre. Je suis d'accord avec la Commission, mais je ne vois pas comment cela a une incidence sur la situation dans laquelle je me trouve. L'intim\u00e9 a perdu l'occasion de traiter les questions soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'instruction. Cela s'applique autant aux questions constitutionnelles qu'aux autres questions en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je ne vois pas comment cela peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un avantage ou une r\u00e9compense.\n[65] J'estime regrettable que l'intim\u00e9 ait refus\u00e9 de participer au processus. Cela ne le prive pas de son droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable et je crois qu'il incombe au Tribunal de voir \u00e0 ce que les questions soulev\u00e9es lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve soient examin\u00e9es correctement. L'intim\u00e9 ne renonce pas \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 une discussion appropri\u00e9e des questions en litige et il ne perd pas ses libert\u00e9s fondamentales garanties par la Charte des droits, tout simplement parce qu'il refuse de compara\u00eetre. Eldon Warman jouit de ses droits et de ses libert\u00e9s. Que cela lui plaise ou non, la justice naturelle s'applique toujours.\n[66] On ne peut nier qu'un tribunal qui exerce la comp\u00e9tence que lui conf\u00e8re l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) fixe des limites \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de notre libert\u00e9 d'expression garantie par l'alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. La question non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si ces limites peuvent \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es en vertu de l'article premier de la Charte. Un certain nombre de points pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9s dans ce contexte.\n[67] Le premier point est qu'il existe diff\u00e9rentes formes d'expression, lesquelles ne sont pas toutes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es au m\u00eame degr\u00e9 par la constitution. M\u00eame avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Charte, les tribunaux ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser que le Canada \u00e9tait dot\u00e9 d'une d\u00e9claration des droits implicite qui prot\u00e8ge le discours politique. Cela est important parce que le dialogue auquel M. Warman a particip\u00e9 dans Internet est fondamentalement politique. Il est peut-\u00eatre pernicieux et source de division. Il n'en demeure pas moins un dialogue politique.\n[68] Le deuxi\u00e8me point est que, dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 les dispositions de la Charte canadienne des droits qui ont trait aux messages haineux au motif que la Loi est r\u00e9paratrice. Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois que, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9volution du droit, la Commission est tenue d'expliquer en quoi l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) s'int\u00e8gre dans le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9paration de la Loi. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu \u00e0 un certain nombre d'occasions que la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire s'\u00e9carte de l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi.\n[69] Il n'y a rien d'accessoire dans cela. La sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) est intrins\u00e8quement punitive. Elle vise \u00e0 d\u00e9courager les personnes qui voudraient porter atteinte \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 vitale sur laquelle les relations dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sont fond\u00e9es. L'importance de la sanction ne devrait pas \u00eatre minimis\u00e9e. Une amende de 10 000 $ pour avoir exprim\u00e9 ses opinions n'a rien d'insignifiant. Cela expose l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les rigueurs de l'indemnisation et des proc\u00e9dures d'outrage.\n[70] La situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pouvait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une forme de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats major\u00e9s ou comme une autre forme d'indemnisation. Cela poserait moins probl\u00e8me si la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e pour att\u00e9nuer les probl\u00e8mes associ\u00e9s aux messages haineux. On m'a toutefois inform\u00e9 que la somme est payable au receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et qu'elle doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e au compte des recettes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Elle n'est pas vers\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation, ni \u00e0 un fonds de victimes, ni \u00e0 une mesure d'indemnisation quelconque.\n[71] Le troisi\u00e8me point a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition ordinaire des fonctions d\u00e9cisionnelles dans notre syst\u00e8me de justice. D'ordinaire, on laisse aux cours criminelles la t\u00e2che de punir les personnes qui commettent des pr\u00e9judices moraux. Il y a des raisons \u00e0 cela. Il existe des mesures de protection institutionnelles au sein du processus criminel qui en font une juridiction plus indiqu\u00e9e pour la poursuite d'une sanction contre une personne qui aurait tenu des propos inadmissibles.\n[72] L'instance devant le Tribunal est de nature civile. La pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un particulier contre un autre particulier. L'objet vis\u00e9 par la tenue d'une instruction en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne n'est pas de mesurer le bl\u00e2me moral associ\u00e9 aux actes d'un intim\u00e9. Elle vise \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination. La t\u00e2che d'imposer un ch\u00e2timent et d'\u00e9valuer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire ne rel\u00e8ve pas du champ normal d'application des responsabilit\u00e9s du Tribunal.\n[73] Cela explique certaines des diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre les deux ar\u00e8nes quant au processus. En cours criminelles, les faits doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis hors de tout doute raisonnable plut\u00f4t que selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Il est clair que m\u00eame si un Tribunal a certains doutes quant \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 d'un intim\u00e9-je crois que culpabilit\u00e9 est le mot qui convient en l'esp\u00e8ce-il peut malgr\u00e9 cela imposer la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Rien n'emp\u00eache le plaignant ou la Commission de demander que l'on porte des accusations criminelles si elles sont justifi\u00e9es.\n[74] La question d'ordre constitutionnelle qui se pose consiste \u00e0 savoir si la libert\u00e9 d'expression de l'intim\u00e9 peut \u00eatre limit\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on sans le genre de garantie proc\u00e9durale et institutionnelle qui existe en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Le droit criminel pr\u00e9voit une norme de preuve plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, la preuve de la mens rea, et l'application stricte des r\u00e8gles de preuve. C'est une chose que de punir une personne apr\u00e8s un proc\u00e8s en cour criminelle, avec toutes les protections que le droit accorde \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9, mais c'est une toute autre chose de faire cela dans le cadre d'un processus con\u00e7u pour d'autres fins.\n[75] On aurait tort de s'\u00e9tendre davantage \u00e0 ce stade-ci du processus. Je veux tout simplement \u00e9num\u00e9rer un certain nombre des questions qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es si le plaignant et la Commission d\u00e9sirent se pr\u00e9valoir de la disposition relative \u00e0 la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire. Je me sens oblig\u00e9 d'ajouter que l'ensemble de ces questions rel\u00e8ve de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public en vertu de l'article 51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cela donne \u00e0 penser que la Commission est tenue, \u00e0 tout le moins, de traiter ces questions.\nB. La fourchette [76] Il y a une deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de question qui est soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Elle est soulev\u00e9e par le fait que l'imposition de la sanction maximale est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux pires cas. Il doit y avoir une fourchette. Cela pose un probl\u00e8me en l'esp\u00e8ce car on ne m'a cit\u00e9 aucune source fiable de jurisprudence \u00e0 partir de laquelle je pourrais d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 la sanction se situe sur la fourchette des possibilit\u00e9s. Je crois que les tribunaux ant\u00e9rieurs ont rencontr\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s semblables.\n[77] Ces pr\u00e9occupations sont mises en \u00e9vidence par le fait que la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un plaignant priv\u00e9. On aurait tort d'\u00e9valuer les sanctions contre des intim\u00e9s au cas par cas. Je ne vois pas comment un tribunal peut \u00e9valuer une sanction \u00e9quitable contre Eldon Warman sans un certain nombre de moyens permettant d'\u00e9tablir une comparaison entre la pr\u00e9sente cause et les autres causes qui ont pu \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es en vertu de la disposition. On pourrait avoirs recours \u00e0 un t\u00e9moignage d'expert qui pourrait \u00e0 tout le moins \u00e9tablir la nature et la fr\u00e9quence des messages haineux accessibles dans Internet.\n[78] Il existe peut-\u00eatre de la jurisprudence en droit criminel qui puisse servir de fondement \u00e0 une analyse. Il y a, par exemple, la cause plut\u00f4t c\u00e9l\u00e8bre R. c. Ahenakew, [2005] S.J. no 439 (C. prov. Sask.), laquelle fait pr\u00e9sentement l'objet d'un appel, dans laquelle l'accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable d'avoir foment\u00e9 la haine en d\u00e9crivant les Juifs comme \u00e9tant une maladie. L'accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer une amende de 1 000 $. La diff\u00e9rence avec la pr\u00e9sente cause est troublante. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission demande l'imposition d'une amende de 10 000 $, dans un processus civil, par contumace, sans les protections du processus criminel.\n[79] \u00c0 titre d'exemple, je ne mentionne qu'Ahenakew. Je ne peux pas me prononcer sur ce qui constituerait une sanction ad\u00e9quate dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. J'affirme tout simplement que la Commission est tenue de fournir au Tribunal des renseignements qui \u00e9tabliraient o\u00f9 une cause se situe dans la gamme de causes qui pourraient \u00eatre soumises au Tribunal. On pourrait n\u00e9anmoins penser que les sanctions impos\u00e9es en droit criminel et le droit en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne devraient \u00eatre conformes. Il s'agit d'une question de proportionnalit\u00e9.\n[80] Je suis conscient que le paragraphe 54(2) \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte par le Tribunal. Bien que cela fournisse un certain nombre de crit\u00e8res utiles, il me semble que tout tribunal conscient de ses obligations se reporterait \u00e0 ces facteurs, avec ou sans directive l\u00e9gislative. Cela importe peu. Ces facteurs ne peuvent pas fournir les points de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dont on a besoin pour \u00e9tablir la fourchette pertinente. Il faut analyser un ensemble de faits pr\u00e9cis.\n[81] Tout ceci est aggrav\u00e9, encore une fois, par une absence totale d'observations de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Je r\u00e9alise que l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre tenu responsable de cela. Toutefois, cela ne fait pas pour autant d'une amende inappropri\u00e9e une amende appropri\u00e9e et cela demeure toujours un probl\u00e8me. Je soup\u00e7onne que la v\u00e9ritable solution consiste \u00e0 contraindre l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Toutefois, cela donne \u00e0 entendre que l'exercice devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans un forum o\u00f9 une certaine forme de pr\u00e9sence est obligatoire.\nV. LA D\u00c9CISION A. La responsabilit\u00e9 [82] Je ne vois pas comment l'analyse prima facie dans la jurisprudence s'applique aux messages haineux. Cela importe peu. Les messages affich\u00e9s sont offensants au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le plaignant et la Commission ont satisfait \u00e0 la norme de preuve exig\u00e9e et la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[83] L'objectif principal de l'article 13 est de retirer le mat\u00e9riel r\u00e9pugnant et, si j'ose dire, dangereux, du d\u00e9bat public. La v\u00e9ritable question qui se pose quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 est de savoir si le mat\u00e9riel est offensant : les questions de culpabilit\u00e9 sont secondaires et les responsabilit\u00e9s du Tribunal consistent principalement \u00e0 garder les canaux de libert\u00e9 d'expression libres de messages qui menacent les fondations normatives de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[84] Le mat\u00e9riel dont je suis saisi va \u00e0 l'encontre du principe que tout le monde est \u00e9gal. Il s'agit de l'un des principes sur lequel repose l'ordre juridique et social. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, les messages affich\u00e9s vilipendent les Juifs. Le th\u00e8me est que les Juifs font partie d'une conspiration diabolique. Je crois que cela alimente une sorte d'hostilit\u00e9 raciale, ethnique ou religieuse qui pr\u00e9sente des dangers pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son ensemble.\n[85] Il existe un autre facteur. Le mat\u00e9riel dont je suis saisi indique clairement que l'intim\u00e9 n'accepte pas la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me juridique et politique. En effet, il y a une insertion dans les messages affich\u00e9s dans laquelle on conteste la validit\u00e9 des lois qui prot\u00e8gent les membres des minorit\u00e9s contre la discrimination, le harc\u00e8lement et l'expression flagrante de haine. Je crois qu'il s'agit d'une circonstance aggravante qui rend le mat\u00e9riel encore plus offensant.\n[86] Je ne fais aucun commentaire sur les arguments politiques qui figurent dans le mat\u00e9riel dont je suis saisi. Eldon Warman vit dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et il a droit \u00e0 ses opinions, peu importe ce que je peux en penser. Je ne voudrais pas limiter le discours politique qui est essentiel au bon fonctionnement d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n[87] Le Tribunal devrait se garder d'aborder la question des textes religieux. La libert\u00e9 de religion comprend la libert\u00e9 de dissidence. J'ajouterais n\u00e9anmoins que la promulgation d'opinions qui encouragent une attitude outrageante envers les textes religieux fondamentaux est susceptible de soumettre \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris les groupes qui consid\u00e8rent ces textes comme sacr\u00e9s.\n[88] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir. Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la Commission que le mat\u00e9riel a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 d'Internet. Les objets fondamentaux vis\u00e9s par la Loi ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits.\nB. La sanction [89] Il est \u00e9vident qu'il ne m'est pas possible de traiter la demande d'imposition d'une sanction en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) sans que l'on formule d'autres observations. Par cons\u00e9quent, je r\u00e9serve ma comp\u00e9tence sur la cause pendant 30 jours afin de donner l'occasion au plaignant ainsi qu'\u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9cider s'ils d\u00e9sirent r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 mes pr\u00e9occupations. S'ils d\u00e9sirent formuler d'autres observations, je crois qu'ils devraient fournir l'avis constitutionnel pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 9(7) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[90] J'ordonne que l'on remette \u00e0 Eldon Warman, par signification indirecte, une copie de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nM.

Hadjis\n[1] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de modifier sa plainte. Lorsqu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 5 septembre 2002, il \u00e9tait encore membre des Forces canadiennes, l'intim\u00e9e. Il pr\u00e9tendait dans la plainte qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maltrait\u00e9 et harcel\u00e9 par ses sup\u00e9rieurs en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (syndrome de stress post-traumatique) et qu'on lui a refus\u00e9 des traitements m\u00e9dicaux auxquels il avait droit, le tout en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). En novembre 2002, deux mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, les Forces canadiennes ont lib\u00e9r\u00e9 le plaignant. Le 19 mai 2004, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction suivant l'article 49 de la Loi.\n[2] Le plaignant souhaite maintenant modifier sa plainte afin d'all\u00e9guer que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 est un facteur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte dans la d\u00e9cision de le lib\u00e9rer. Il pr\u00e9tend que sa lib\u00e9ration constitue un acte discriminatoire suivant l'article 7 de la Loi. Il pr\u00e9tend en outre qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par mesure de repr\u00e9sailles parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte, en contravention de l'article 14.1.\n[3] Les Forces canadiennes contestent la requ\u00eate. Comme point pr\u00e9alable, elles pr\u00e9tendent que la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu'il n'y a pas d'affidavit au soutien des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Je ne partage pas cette opinion. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ne sont pas aussi formelles que celles d'une cour. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'un affidavit soit produit au soutien des requ\u00eates (voir l'article 3 des R\u00e8gles). En fait, les requ\u00eates n'ont \u00e0 respecter aucune forme particuli\u00e8re. Le Tribunal re\u00e7oit couramment des requ\u00eates sous la forme de lettres et m\u00eame de messages \u00e9lectroniques. Le principal objectif consiste \u00e0 s'assurer que toutes les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d'\u00eatre entendues par le Tribunal.\n[4] Les Forces canadiennes soulignent que l'avocat du plaignant expose en d\u00e9tail plusieurs faits et \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans l'avis de requ\u00eate pour expliquer pourquoi la plainte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t dans le processus, mais qu'aucun de ces faits ou \u00e9v\u00e9nements n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 par affidavit. Cependant, dans leur contestation, les Forces canadiennes renvoient \u00e0 de nombreux faits et incidents qui se seraient produits au cours des diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de la plainte et qui ne sont pas non plus appuy\u00e9s par un affidavit. Il est important de mentionner que le plaignant n'essaie pas de prouver sa plainte \u00e0 ce moment-ci. Il tente simplement d'ajouter plusieurs all\u00e9gations \u00e0 la plainte. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en compte toutes les circonstances, je suis convaincu que le Tribunal est en mesure de traiter d'une mani\u00e8re juste, sur le fondement du dossier dont il dispose, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de modifier la plainte, et la contestation. Aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'est requis.\n[5] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, [2004] TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 5 et 6, le Tribunal a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 certains des principes qui ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions traitant de la question de la modification des plaintes. D'abord, une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne n'est pas une mise en accusation. Le Tribunal dispose d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lui permettant de modifier une plainte afin d'y ajouter d'autres all\u00e9gations, dans la mesure o\u00f9 un avis suffisant est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 afin qu'il ne subisse pas de pr\u00e9judice et qu'il puisse se d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d'une plainte soient faites dans une instance distincte. Plut\u00f4t, une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu'il soit clair et manifeste qu'il sera jug\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations additionnelles ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\n[6] Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent qu'il n'y a pas de lien entre la lib\u00e9ration du plaignant et sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Selon la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. 1985, ch. N-5, les officiers et les militaires du rang ne peuvent \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9s que par le chef d'\u00e9tat-major ou par l'officier qu'il d\u00e9signe, conform\u00e9ment aux Ordonnances administratives des Forces canadiennes. Les individus qui ont particip\u00e9 aux actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte ne pouvaient par cons\u00e9quent pas avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de lib\u00e9rer le plaignant. Il n'est par cons\u00e9quent pas r\u00e9aliste pour le plaignant de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il y a un lien entre la lib\u00e9ration et la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette pr\u00e9tention peut \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 seulement apr\u00e8s une instruction compl\u00e8te du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les faits. \u00c0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape, le plaignant demande simplement d'ajouter certaines all\u00e9gations, all\u00e9gations qu'il aura le fardeau de prouver par la suite lors de l'audience. Il n'est pas clair et manifeste qu'il sera jug\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\n[8] Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent que le plaignant essaie de court-circuiter le processus en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne pr\u00e9vu par la Loi en tentant de renvoyer une plainte directement au Tribunal sans l'avoir d'abord d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission pour qu'elle proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un examen et \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate. Je ne partage pas cette opinion. Les nouveaux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ne constituent pas une plainte distincte de celle qui a originalement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 2002. Ces faits sont plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient survenus avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Essentiellement, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que la discrimination dont il a fait l'objet alors qu'il travaillait pour les Forces canadiennes \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un facteur dans sa lib\u00e9ration subs\u00e9quente. Il pr\u00e9tend en outre que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame un facteur (une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi). C'est une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements continus qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, non pas un incident distinct sans lien avec les \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n[9] Comme le Tribunal l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d'Onion Lake (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/77, au paragraphe 17 (TCDP), les questions qui d\u00e9coulent d'un m\u00eame ensemble de circonstances factuelles devraient normalement \u00eatre entendues ensemble. Cependant, une modification \u00e0 une plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e lorsqu'elle cause un pr\u00e9judice injuste \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Un tel pr\u00e9judice doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et important (Cook, au paragraphe 20). Il faut qu'un pr\u00e9judice soit effectivement caus\u00e9. Le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Cook a propos\u00e9 que les facteurs \u00e0 prendre en compte incluent le retard et qu'ils pourraient inclure la perte de l'enqu\u00eate et du processus de conciliation de la Commission.\n[10] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l'intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas que le plaignant a inform\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission de sa lib\u00e9ration et que ce fait est express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9 dans le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur. Cependant, le plaignant a fait conna\u00eetre son intention de demander une modification \u00e0 la plainte en juin 2005, plus de deux ans et demi apr\u00e8s la lib\u00e9ration. Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent qu'elles subiront un pr\u00e9judice si la requ\u00eate est accueillie, \u00e0 savoir l'obligation de pr\u00e9parer une d\u00e9fense aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[11] Je ne suis pas convaincu que cette situation constitue un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el et important. \u00c0 mon avis, le simple fait qu'il se soit \u00e9coul\u00e9 de nombreux mois ou m\u00eame d'ann\u00e9es depuis la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte originale ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement que l'ajout d'all\u00e9gations causera \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el et important. Comme le Tribunal l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [2005] TCDP 1, au paragraphe 10, le formulaire de plainte existe principalement pour les besoins de la Commission. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire qui soul\u00e8ve un ensemble de faits qui requi\u00e8rent une enqu\u00eate plus approfondie. C'est l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal), plut\u00f4t que la plainte originale, qui \u00e9tablit les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l'audience. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ni la divulgation de documents ni l'\u00e9change des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions n'ont encore eu lieu. L'audience ne sera pas tenue avant plusieurs mois. Les Forces canadiennes ont amplement le temps de pr\u00e9parer leur d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des aspects de la plainte soulev\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de modifier la plainte. Toute pr\u00e9occupation pr\u00e9cise qui se rapporte au calendrier pourra \u00eatre trait\u00e9e lorsque les dates de divulgation et d'audience seront \u00e9tablies lors du processus de gestion des causes.\n[12] De plus, je ne partage pas la pr\u00e9tention des Forces canadiennes selon laquelle elles subissent un pr\u00e9judice du fait que les nouvelles all\u00e9gations ne seront pas soumises aux processus d'enqu\u00eate et de conciliation de la Commission, comme la plainte originale l'a \u00e9t\u00e9. L'avantage \u00e9vident de ces processus est la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler les plaintes \u00e0 une \u00e9tape peu avanc\u00e9e, avant le renvoi au Tribunal. Une fois qu'une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e, rien n'emp\u00eache un intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter devant le Tribunal tous les arguments et toutes les explications qu'il aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission. De plus, le processus de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal offre aux parties la m\u00eame possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler leur litige que le fait le processus de conciliation de la Commission.\n[13] Cela ne veut aucunement dire que les plaignants devraient croire qu'ils peuvent omettre d'inclure dans leur plainte originale des faits en tenant erron\u00e9ment pour acquis qu'ils ont un droit absolu d'inclure d'autres all\u00e9gations par la suite. Un tel comportement pourrait \u00eatre jug\u00e9 abusif.\n[14] Cependant, dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, je suis convaincu que le plaignant n'a pas eu un tel comportement. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission de sa lib\u00e9ration peu apr\u00e8s qu'elle a eu lieu. Pour une raison ou pour une autre, la plainte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment. Cela a peu de cons\u00e9quences dans les circonstances de l'affaire. \u00c0 mon avis, le fait d'autoriser maintenant la modification de la plainte ne causera pas un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el ou important aux Forces canadiennes.\n[15] Les Forces canadiennes ont soulign\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette modification est demand\u00e9e deux ans et demi apr\u00e8s la lib\u00e9ration du plaignant, elle est prescrite. Suivant l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi, la Commission dispose d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lui permettant de ne pas traiter une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e suivant l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un an apr\u00e8s qu'est survenu le fait sur lequel elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances. Cette disposition se rapporte clairement \u00e0 de nouvelles plaintes. Toutefois, ce n'est pas une nouvelle plainte qui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Commission a d\u00e9j\u00e0 exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal. Les incidents soulev\u00e9s dans la modification se rapportent directement aux all\u00e9gations d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte. Aucune p\u00e9riode n'est prorog\u00e9e du fait que la requ\u00eate est accueillie. Le plaignant est simplement autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter sa plainte actuelle pour inclure des faits qui sont survenus apr\u00e8s la plainte originale.\n[16] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate du plaignant est accueillie. La plainte est modifi\u00e9e pour inclure les paragraphes suivants, comme ils sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les observations du plaignant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate en vue de modifier la plainte, \u00e0 savoir :\nLe plaignant, monsieur Alain Parent avait un contrat d'emploi avec les forces canadiennes jusqu'en 2019. Le plaignant consid\u00e8re que sa lib\u00e9ration par les forces canadiennes est un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, allant \u00e0 l'encontre de l'article 7 et une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles allant \u00e0 l'encontre de l'article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; Par les agissements des forces canadiennes, brisant son lien d'emploi et le discriminant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, le plaignant a vu son plan de carri\u00e8re an\u00e9anti et doit \u00eatre d\u00e9dommag\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence.\nAthanios D.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Le 21 janvier 2000, Simone Sherman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne all\u00e9guant que son employeur, Revenu Canada (maintenant appel\u00e9 l'Agence du revenu du Canada (l'ARC)), avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en la traitant d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, en ne prenant aucune mesure d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et, enfin, en la cong\u00e9diant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2004, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour instruction.\n[2] La plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Sherman fait partie d'un long conflit qui a engendr\u00e9 des litiges parall\u00e8les dans de nombreux forums. Les probl\u00e8mes ont commenc\u00e9 lorsque Mme Sherman s'est mise \u00e0 souffrir de blessures attribuables \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches r\u00e9p\u00e9titives occasionn\u00e9es par son travail de sp\u00e9cialiste en v\u00e9rification par ordinateur \u00e0 l'ARC. Au cur des divers litiges d\u00e9coulant des blessures de Mme Sherman, se trouve la question de savoir si l'ARC a pris les mesures ad\u00e9quates pour accommoder Mme Sherman en raison de ses limites physiques.\n[3] Mme Sherman cherche maintenant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance d\u00e9clarant que les conclusions de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant qui a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'ARC de la cong\u00e9dier, lient le Tribunal, et ce, en vertu de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. L'ARC, en r\u00e9ponse, a pr\u00e9tendu que la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e devrait s'appliquer, mais seulement en rapport avec les conclusions de la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents du travail (autrefois appel\u00e9e la Commission des accidents du travail). \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, les d\u00e9cisions rendues par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle ainsi que par la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l'assurance contre les accidents du travail (CSPAAT) semblent se contredire.\n[4] Les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont les suivantes :\nLa doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique-t-elle aux conclusions de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant et (ou) aux conclusions de la CSPAAT? Si la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique dans l'un ou l'autre cas, ou dans les deux cas, le Tribunal devrait-il exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas appliquer la doctrine?\nI. La doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique-t-elle aux d\u00e9cisions de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant et (ou) aux d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT? A. Les faits [5] Vers 1994, Mme Sherman a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir de blessures attribuables \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches r\u00e9p\u00e9titives. Elle s'est absent\u00e9e de son travail et, plus tard, elle s'est vu accorder des prestations d'accident du travail.\n[6] En 1996, Mme Sherman a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 raison de quatre heures par jour. Les services de deux experts diff\u00e9rents en am\u00e9nagement ergonomique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus, et ce, \u00e0 des moments diff\u00e9rents, afin d'aider l'ARC dans ses efforts visant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Sherman. Le processus posait de nombreuses difficult\u00e9s.\n[7] En mai 1998, la CSPAAT a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin aux services de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle ainsi qu'aux prestations compl\u00e9mentaires dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait Mme Sherman. Ces deux d\u00e9cisions furent fond\u00e9es sur l'opinion de la CSPAAT que Mme Sherman \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, sans perte de revenu, dans des t\u00e2ches ayant fait l'objet de mesures d'accommodement et que l'ARC s'\u00e9tait en grande partie acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d'accommodement. Mme Sherman a interjet\u00e9 appel de ces deux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la CSPAAT. Ces affaires ont cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9es en suspens.\n[8] De plus, entre janvier 1996 et ao\u00fbt 2000, \u00e0 la suite d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se sont produits, trois griefs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par le syndicat de Mme Sherman. Ces griefs avaient trait \u00e0 la cessation, en septembre 1997, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour accident du travail de Mme Sherman, \u00e0 sa suspension sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de juillet 1998 et au rejet de sa demande de mai 1998 d'\u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses fonctions avec mesures d'accommodement et r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration r\u00e9troactive. Un certain nombre des questions soulev\u00e9es par Mme Sherman dans ses griefs sont \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[9] En juillet 1998, Mme Sherman a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte ind\u00e9pendante contre l'ARC dans laquelle elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que plusieurs de ses superviseurs l'avaient harcel\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, qu'ils avaient abus\u00e9 de leur autorit\u00e9 et qu'ils avaient fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Elle a demand\u00e9 qu'une enqu\u00eate soit men\u00e9e sur sa plainte par un tiers ind\u00e9pendant. Mme Sherman a rejet\u00e9 la proposition faite par l'ARC qu'elle joigne sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[10] Le 14 mai 1999, on a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Sherman parce qu'elle avait refus\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelles (ECF). Cette d\u00e9cision a ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e par l'ARC. Toutefois, le 28 ao\u00fbt 2000, l'ARC a une fois de plus cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Sherman en invoquant, comme principales raisons de ce cong\u00e9diement, le refus de cette derni\u00e8re de se soumettre \u00e0 une ECF ainsi que son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de son poste.\n[11] Mme Sherman a contest\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement au moyen d'un examen par un tiers ind\u00e9pendant. L'examen par un tiers ind\u00e9pendant est un processus relativement nouveau qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u par l'ARC en vertu du pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi sur l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada, L.C. 1999, ch. 17. Ce processus pr\u00e9voit la tenue d'un examen ind\u00e9pendant des griefs ayant trait aux cong\u00e9diements, aux r\u00e9trogradations, aux mises \u00e0 pied ainsi qu'\u00e0 certaines mesures de dotation en personnel.\n[12] Le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2003, apr\u00e8s une audience d'une dur\u00e9e de 19 jours, laquelle fut pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e par de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions portant sur des questions pr\u00e9liminaires, l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant a rendu sa d\u00e9cision. Il a ordonn\u00e9 que Mme Sherman soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans la position qu'elle occupait avant de commencer \u00e0 souffrir de ses blessures et qu'on lui verse son salaire ainsi que ses avantages sociaux, et ce, avec effet r\u00e9troactif au 28 ao\u00fbt 2000. L'examinateur a \u00e9galement conclu que l'ARC n'avait pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations d'accommoder Mme Sherman quant \u00e0 son poste et qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours tenue de respecter ces obligations, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\n[13] Mme Sherman a par la suite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin d'obtenir une ordonnance de mandamus obligeant l'ARC \u00e0 donner suite \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments contest\u00e9s de la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. Puis, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate d'ordonnance d'outrage au tribunal concernant l'application de l'ordonnance de mandamus. L'ordonnance de mandamus a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, mais la requ\u00eate d'ordonnance d'outrage au tribunal n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue. Une autre requ\u00eate d'ordonnance de mandamus a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale par Mme Sherman, mais, elle \u00e9galement, n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue.\n[14] En juin 2004, les griefs de Mme Sherman ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es \u00e0 l'arbitrage devant la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique (la CRTFP). Dans une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire rendue le 27 ao\u00fbt 2004, la CRTFP a conclu que la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'appliquait aux neuf conclusions qui sous-tendent la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. L'ARC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la CRTFP quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. Une audience concernant cette demande sera bient\u00f4t tenue.\n[15] La question de l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e a une fois de plus \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que bien que les crit\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e sont plus susceptibles d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits dans le cas de la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant que dans le cas des d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT, il convient en l'esp\u00e8ce que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas appliquer la doctrine.\nB. Le droit et l'analyse [16] La pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e a pour objet de mettre fin irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 un litige. Il s'agit d'un outil juridique qui est utile tant sur le plan pratique que sur le plan de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Non seulement il est p\u00e9nalisant et co\u00fbteux que des parties continuent \u00e0 d\u00e9battre les m\u00eames questions, il est \u00e9galement injuste pour la partie qui a eu gain de cause de livrer la bataille une fois de plus (Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460).\n[17] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la partie qui a eu gain de cause, Mme Sherman, cherche \u00e0 utiliser la doctrine pour une fin diff\u00e9rente. Elle d\u00e9sire utiliser la victoire qu'elle a obtenue dans le cadre du processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l'audience du Tribunal quant aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui ne relevaient pas de la comp\u00e9tence des autres forums. Elle esp\u00e8re \u00e9galement que cela lui permettra d'obtenir une r\u00e9paration suppl\u00e9mentaire pour des questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es dans un autre forum ou qui peuvent, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es dans un autre forum. La question consiste \u00e0 savoir si cela constitue une utilisation convenable de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\n[18] L'ARC, par contre, emploie la doctrine au sens traditionnel - c'est-\u00e0-dire comme rempart servant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher Mme Sherman de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau des questions qui, selon l'ARC, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es d'une fa\u00e7on concluante par la CSPAAT. L'ARC pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que les conditions relatives \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, ne sont pas remplies.\n[19] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 deux volets d'application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est maintenant bien connu : (1) les conditions relatives \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e doivent \u00eatre remplies; et (2) si les conditions sont remplies, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider, selon certains facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires, s'il convient, dans les circonstances, d'appliquer la doctrine (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 33).\n[20] Les conditions \u00e0 remplir pour l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e sont les suivantes :\nles m\u00eames questions sont en litige dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire qui est cens\u00e9e cr\u00e9er la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est une d\u00e9cision finale; les parties, ou leurs ayants droits, sont les m\u00eames.\n(i) Les m\u00eames questions [21] Pour que les questions en litige soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant les m\u00eames, elles doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point fondamentales \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l'instance ant\u00e9rieure que la d\u00e9cision n'existerait pas sans elles (Angle c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), [1975] 2 R.C.S. 248). De plus, cette exigence de la doctrine n'est satisfaite que si, \u00e0 la suite d'une analyse m\u00e9ticuleuse des faits pertinents ainsi que du droit applicable, on peut affirmer que la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e aux questions en litige dans l'instance ant\u00e9rieure r\u00e9pond, \u00e0 tout le moins, \u00e0 un certain nombre des questions en litige dans l'instance subs\u00e9quente (Heynen c. Frito Lay Canada Ltd. (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 776, paragraphe 20).\n[22] La pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique aux questions de fait, aux questions de droit ainsi qu'aux questions mixtes de droit et de fait. L'exigence des m\u00eames questions peut s'appliquer \u00e0 deux niveaux dans les proc\u00e9dures. Elle peut s'appliquer aux conclusions de fond ou aux conclusions tir\u00e9es de la preuve \u00e0 partir desquelles les conclusions finales sont tir\u00e9es et elle peut s'appliquer aux conclusions finales elles-m\u00eames (Minott c. O'Shanter Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.)). Dans certains cas, l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e dispose totalement de la question dans l'instance subs\u00e9quente. Dans d'autres cas, elle peut tout simplement restreindre les questions \u00e0 trancher. Les parties pr\u00e9tendent que c'est ce dernier r\u00e9sultat qui d\u00e9coulerait d'une d\u00e9cision d'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\nLa d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant [23] La question dont \u00e9tait saisi l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant \u00e9tait de savoir si la d\u00e9cision de l'ARC de cong\u00e9dier Mme Sherman \u00e9tait raisonnable. Ainsi formul\u00e9e, la question ne semble pas \u00eatre la m\u00eame que celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Sherman \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Toutefois, lorsque l'on examine les motifs invoqu\u00e9s par l'ARC quant au cong\u00e9diement de Mme Sherman, il devient \u00e9vident que la question de savoir si le cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait conforme au droit en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e9tait essentielle \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant.\n[24] En examinant la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9diement prise par l'ARC, l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant devait d\u00e9cider si Mme Sherman \u00e9tait invalide, si elle \u00e9tait capable de s'acquitter de ses fonctions avec ou sans mesures d'accommodement, si on lui avait fourni des mesures d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive, si elle avait collabor\u00e9 aux efforts faits pour l'accommoder et si l'exigence d'effectuer les \u00e9valuations de capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[25] Les trois questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Sherman sont les suivantes : (1) le cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait-il discriminatoire? (2) l'ARC a-t-elle omis de prendre des mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Sherman? (3) Mme Sherman a-t-elle fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent au cours de son emploi, et ce, en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience?\n[26] Les deux premi\u00e8res questions sont les m\u00eames que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. Toutefois, les questions concernant la diff\u00e9rence de traitement ne sont pas tout \u00e0 fait les m\u00eames que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es dans la premi\u00e8re instance. Les all\u00e9gations de Mme Sherman concernant la diff\u00e9rence de traitement sont les suivantes : on lui a refus\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s de formation, on l'a envoy\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maladie, on l'a suspendue sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, on a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder une promotion, on ne lui a pas permis de travailler \u00e0 la maison et on ne lui a pas fourni de mat\u00e9riel diff\u00e9rent pour l'accommoder en raison du fait qu'elle souffrait, du moins en partie, d'une d\u00e9ficience. Ces questions n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant parce qu'il n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence ou il les a examin\u00e9es indirectement en \u00e9valuant les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s de bonne foi par l'ARC afin d'accommoder Mme Sherman avant de la cong\u00e9dier. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces questions ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par le crit\u00e8re de la m\u00eame question de la doctrine.\n[27] Bien que certains des documents soumis par Mme Sherman \u00e0 l'appui de sa requ\u00eate semblent indiquer que l'instruction devant le Tribunal sera limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la question des redressements, d'autres indications nous permettent de penser que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve seront produits quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. Il est certain que rien dans les documents n'indique que Mme Sherman a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'ARC quant aux all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es concernant la diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Ces all\u00e9gations comportent des questions diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant.\nLes d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT [28] L'ARC pr\u00e9tend que les d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT traitent des m\u00eames questions que celles qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Sherman et, par cons\u00e9quent, cet aspect du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT.\n[29] En fait, la CSPAAT a rendu trois d\u00e9cisions. L'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant a conclu que la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'appliquait quant aux conclusions de la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 30 janvier 1996. Toutefois, l'examinateur a refus\u00e9 d'appliquer la doctrine quant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me et quant \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision parce qu'il a conclu que l'ARC n'avait pas soulev\u00e9 la question en temps opportun et n'avait pas avis\u00e9 Mme Sherman.\n[30] Ce n'est pas le cas dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. L'ARC a fait part de sa position concernant cette question en temps opportun, et ce, de mani\u00e8re exhaustive. Il importe peu que cela fut fait au moyen d'une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Mme Sherman. L'ARC pr\u00e9tend que, dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par la deuxi\u00e8me et la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT.\n[31] Selon moi, les questions fondamentales \u00e0 trancher dans la deuxi\u00e8me et la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes des questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Les questions fondamentales dans ces d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient de savoir si Mme Sherman avait droit \u00e0 des services de r\u00e9adaptation personnelle ou \u00e0 des prestations compl\u00e9mentaires. Bien que la CSPAAT ait d\u00fb examiner, dans une certaine mesure, si l'ARC avait pris des mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Sherman, la question \u00e0 laquelle la CSPAAT \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e9tait de savoir si l'employeur \u00e9tait suffisamment sur la bonne voie avec ses efforts d'accommodement pour justifier le retrait de la CSPAAT du processus. Cela est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent de la question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Sherman, notamment quant \u00e0 savoir si l'ARC avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 toutes les solutions de rechange viables en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement sans subir de contrainte excessive (Eyerley c. SeaspanInternational Ltd. [2001] C.H.R.D. no 45, paragraphe 159).\n(ii) Les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires d\u00e9finitives [32] Aux fins de cet aspect du crit\u00e8re, une d\u00e9cision sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de nature judiciaire si le d\u00e9cideur pouvait \u00eatre investi d'un pouvoir juridictionnel et qu'il pouvait exercer ce pouvoir de mani\u00e8re judiciaire (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 47). Une d\u00e9cision est rendue de mani\u00e8re judiciaire si elle s'appuie sur des conclusions de fait et sur l'application \u00e0 ces faits d'une norme juridique objective (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 41).\n[33] Une d\u00e9cision est finale aux fins de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e lorsque le forum d\u00e9cisionnel qui prononce la d\u00e9cision n'a plus comp\u00e9tence pour entendre de nouveau la question ou pour modifier ou annuler une conclusion (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 2e \u00e9d. (Toronto : LexisNexis Canada, 2004), page 86).\nLa d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant [34] Le processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant conf\u00e8re \u00e0 celui-ci le pouvoir de s'acquitter de ses responsabilit\u00e9s d\u00e9cisionnelles de mani\u00e8re judiciaire. De plus, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant \u00e9tait finale et devait \u00eatre rendue d'une mani\u00e8re judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant satisfait \u00e0 cet aspect du crit\u00e8re.\nLes d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT [35] La deuxi\u00e8me et la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision de la CSPAAT font pr\u00e9sentement l'objet d'un appel. Toutefois, Mme Sherman a demand\u00e9 qu'elles soient suspendues en attendant le r\u00e9sultat de l'autre instance. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit juste de p\u00e9naliser ainsi l'ARC.\n[36] Selon moi, la Loi de 1997 sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et l'assurance contre les accidents du travail, L.O. 1997, ch. 16 (la Loi) conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la CSPAAT le pouvoir de rendre des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires. De plus, je conclus que la Loi exige que les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission soient rendues d'une mani\u00e8re judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que cet aspect du crit\u00e8re est \u00e9galement satisfait quant aux d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT.\n(iii) Les parties ou leurs ayants-droits sont les m\u00eames [37] Pour que la troisi\u00e8me exigence soit satisfaite, les parties ou leurs ayants-droits doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames. Les parties en cause dans le processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant et dans le processus de la CSPAAT \u00e9taient Mme Sherman et l'ARC. Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, il y a une partie additionnelle qui n'\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 l'instance ant\u00e9rieure - la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[38] Lorsque les parties \u00e0 l'instance ne sont pas les m\u00eames, cet aspect du crit\u00e8re peut encore \u00eatre satisfait si l'une des parties \u00e9tait l'ayant-droit de l'autre partie dans la ou les instances ant\u00e9rieures. Pour qu'il y ait un ayant-droit, il doit y avoir un degr\u00e9 suffisant d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun entre la partie et l'ayant-droit pour qu'il soit juste de lier la partie aux d\u00e9cisions rendues dans l'instance ant\u00e9rieure (Danyluk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 60). Les d\u00e9cisions concernant la question de savoir s'il y a un degr\u00e9 suffisant d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun pour affirmer qu'une partie \u00e9tait l'ayant-droit d'une autre doivent \u00eatre prises au cas par cas (Smith, J. c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2005 TCDP 22, paragraphe 28).\n[39] Le Tribunal a h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que la Commission \u00e9tait un ayant-droit du plaignant en raison de l'incidence que cela aurait sur la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans des instances devant le Tribunal (Parisien c. Commission r\u00e9gionale de transport d'Ottawa-Carleton, [2002] C.H.R.D. 23; et Desormeaux c. Commission r\u00e9gionale de transport d'Ottawa-Carleton, [2002] C.H.R.D. 22).\n[40] Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle ne participera pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et qu'elle ne compara\u00eetra pas \u00e0 l'audience sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cela donne \u00e0 penser que, selon la Commission, aucune question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, autre que celles soulev\u00e9es par Mme Sherman et par l'ARC, ne doit \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e, que ce soit dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ou dans le contexte de l'instruction sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, en l'esp\u00e8ce, je crois qu'il existe un degr\u00e9 suffisant d'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun entre la Commission et Mme Sherman pour pouvoir affirmer qu'elles sont des ayants-droits de l'une et de l'autre. Par cons\u00e9quent, cet aspect du crit\u00e8re est satisfait quant aux d\u00e9cisions de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant et quant aux d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT.\nConclusion concernant le crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e [41] Je conclus que les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, mais pas quant aux d\u00e9cisions de la CSPAAT.\nII. La doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s'applique-t-elle en l'esp\u00e8ce? [42] Dans Danyluk, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre automatiquement appliqu\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que les conditions pr\u00e9alables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites. Au contraire, les tribunaux doivent examiner s'il convient, dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'esp\u00e8ce, d'appliquer la doctrine, compte tenu d'un certain nombre de facteurs.\n[43] Comme les conditions pr\u00e9alables pour l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites qu'en rapport avec la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, je limiterai ma discussion des facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires au contexte de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[44] Un certain nombre des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame sont applicables en l'esp\u00e8ce alors que d'autres ne le sont pas. Je ne traiterai que des facteurs qui sont applicables. Par ailleurs, compte tenu de la d\u00e9claration faite par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Danyluk que la liste des facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires n'est pas exhaustive, j'ai pris la libert\u00e9 d'examiner un facteur suppl\u00e9mentaire : les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice seront-ils servis par l'application de la doctrine?\n(i) Le libell\u00e9 de la loi et l'objet vis\u00e9 par la loi [45] Les lignes directrices concernant le processus de l'examen par un examinateur ind\u00e9pendant pr\u00e9voient un examen des d\u00e9cisions des gestionnaires dans des circonstances tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. La port\u00e9e du redressement qui peut-\u00eatre apport\u00e9 est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e. De plus, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant a comp\u00e9tence exclusive quant \u00e0 l'examen des d\u00e9cisions de cong\u00e9diement.\n[46] En fait, Mme Sherman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne apr\u00e8s que l'ARC eut rendu sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00e9tait manifestement au courant qu'il existait des forums autres que le processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant qui peuvent accorder un redressement qui non seulement est plus complet que celui qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 dans le processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, mais qui peuvent \u00e9galement traiter la vaste gamme d'all\u00e9gations d\u00e9coulant de la question fondamentale pos\u00e9e dans l'ensemble de ses litiges - le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 traitement discriminatoire de la part de l'ARC en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[47] Le probl\u00e8me avec un syst\u00e8me de comp\u00e9tence concurrente exerc\u00e9e par de nombreux forums est que les parties comme Mme Sherman sont confront\u00e9es \u00e0 des choix tr\u00e8s difficiles : devraient-elles mettre tous leurs ufs dans le m\u00eame panier et centrer leurs efforts sur l'obtention d'un r\u00e9sultat favorable dans le forum qui poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence la plus vaste et qui peut fournir le redressement le plus complet ou devraient-elles tirer dans toutes les directions et esp\u00e9rer qu'elles auront gain de cause dans au moins un forum, lequel gain de cause pourra alors \u00eatre utilis\u00e9, au moyen de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, pour obtenir des d\u00e9cisions favorables et des redressements dans d'autres forums?\n[48] En l'esp\u00e8ce, Mme Sherman a choisi la derni\u00e8re approche. Elle a explor\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes avenues afin d'obtenir un redressement. Elle a obtenu gain de cause dans un certain nombre de forums alors que ce ne fut pas le cas dans d'autres forums.\n[49] Il est difficile de voir comment les buts vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e - c'est-\u00e0-dire la recherche de la constance et du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif dans les litiges ainsi que l'encouragement \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution des diff\u00e9rends dans un seul forum - sont atteints en permettant \u00e0 Mme Sherman de se servir de ses d\u00e9cisions favorables pour non seulement obtenir des redressements additionnels, mais \u00e9galement pour l'aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments additionnels de sa plainte dans d'autre forums. La jurisprudence r\u00e9cente sur cette question a insist\u00e9 sur le principe que lorsque plusieurs questions connexes \u00e9manent d'un conflit en milieu de travail, elles devraient \u00eatre entendues par un seul arbitre, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela est possible sur le plan de la comp\u00e9tence, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter des r\u00e9sultats et des recours incompatibles (Ford Motor Co. of Canada c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) (C.A. Ont.), paragraphe 60).\n(ii) Les garanties offertes aux parties dans le cadre de l'instance administrative [50] Je suis \u00e9galement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par les garanties proc\u00e9durales offertes aux parties en vertu du processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. Bien qu'il soit dot\u00e9 d'un nombre important de garanties proc\u00e9durales, le processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant semble accuser une carence sur le plan des pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires pour garantir que chacune des parties aient la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre connaissance des pr\u00e9tentions de l'autre partie et de les r\u00e9futer. L'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant a lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'absence de pouvoir, dans les lignes directrices du processus de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, d'assigner des t\u00e9moins et de demander la production de documents constituait un [Traduction] handicap important dans le processus d'appr\u00e9ciation des faits dans les affaires complexes comme le cong\u00e9diement de Mme Sherman (page 34 de la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant). Il s'agit d'un crit\u00e8re dont on se sert pour d\u00e9cider si on doit exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal d'appliquer la doctrine de pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\n(iii) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice seront-ils servis par l'application de la doctrine? [51] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, la pr\u00e9sente cause comporte une multiplicit\u00e9 d'instances qui se d\u00e9roulent dans de nombreux forums. Certaines ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires sur des points importants et certaines ne sont pas encore rendues au stade de l'audience ou de la prise de d\u00e9cision. En effet, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la volumineuse documentation concernant les diverses instances, on a la nette impression que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne peut tout simplement pas servir de raccourci rapide \u00e0 travers cet ensemble disparate de d\u00e9cisions et de proc\u00e9dures.\n[52] Le probl\u00e8me d\u00e9coule en partie du fait que Mme Sherman ne fait pas que demander au Tribunal d'appliquer les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures rendues par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la question des r\u00e9parations additionnelles qui ne lui \u00e9taient ou ne lui sont pas offertes dans d'autres forums. Au contraire, elle demande la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance que quelque 54 conclusions de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, lesquelles couvrent une vaste gamme de questions dans la plainte, lient le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision en ce qui concerne les autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination comme la diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Il est probable qu'en tirant des conclusions concernant les autres all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte et concernant les redressements appropri\u00e9s, le Tribunal devra tirer des conclusions additionnelles qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. Il se peut que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour prouver ou r\u00e9futer ces all\u00e9gations s'\u00e9garent dans le domaine des faits qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis par l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant. Il ne fait alors aucun doute qu'il y aura des d\u00e9saccords quant \u00e0 savoir si on peut pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur un point qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 mais qui peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir le contexte ou pour prouver un fait qui est toujours en litige. Il est difficile de voir comment de telles controverses aideront les parties ou le Tribunal \u00e0 atteindre un r\u00e9sultat rapide et \u00e9quitable quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[53] Par ailleurs, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape du processus, sans avoir eu l'avantage d'entendre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou un argument, il serait imprudent de ma part de lier le Tribunal quant \u00e0 certaines conclusions qui peuvent ou peuvent ne pas cadrer avec les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s concernant les all\u00e9gations qui sont toujours en litige.\nIII. Conclusion et ordonnance [54] Bien que les crit\u00e8res relatifs \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e aient \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'examinateur ind\u00e9pendant, il convient, en l'esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Danyluk, que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'appliquer la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. Compte tenu de la multiplicit\u00e9 et de la complexit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures et des d\u00e9cisions relatives aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte, je ne crois pas que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice seront servis par l'application, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de la doctrine.\n[55] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de Mme Sherman ainsi que la demande de l'ARC, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, d'appliquer la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e sont rejet\u00e9es.\nKaren A.

La plainte [1] L'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 24 ao\u00fbt 1983. Cette plainte est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nIl est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, \u00e0 titre d'employeur, a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en r\u00e9mun\u00e9rant plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement les employ\u00e9s du Groupe des op\u00e9rations postales, lequel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, que les employ\u00e9s du Groupe commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements, lequel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, et ce, pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du Groupe des op\u00e9rations postales, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, peuvent \u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 58,9 pour cent plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux du Groupe commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, et ce, pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la composition des deux groupes quant au sexe a occasionn\u00e9 de la discrimination sur le plan salarial contre le Groupe commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements, et ce, en contravention de l'article 11.\nLa mesure corrective :\nQue tous les employ\u00e9s du Groupe CR \u00e0 l'emploi de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes re\u00e7oivent des salaires, tel que ce mot est d\u00e9fini au paragraphe 11(6) (maintenant le paragraphe 11(7)) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00e9gaux aux salaires des employ\u00e9s du Groupe PO ; lesquels effectuent un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Que cette mesure corrective s'applique r\u00e9troactivement au 16 octobre 1981.\nB. L'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate [2] D\u00e8s qu'une plainte est re\u00e7ue par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), les proc\u00e9dures g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui sont suivies sont celles qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne1 (la Loi).\n[3] Lorsque la Commission re\u00e7oit une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi, elle peut nommer un enqu\u00eateur pour effectuer un examen pr\u00e9liminaire de la nature et des d\u00e9tails de la plainte. L'ensemble des parties \u00e0 la plainte sont impliqu\u00e9es dans cet examen. Les d\u00e9fenses de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre des all\u00e9gations mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte font partie int\u00e9grale de l'examen.\n[4] Lorsque cet examen est termin\u00e9, la Commission a le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider qu'une d\u00e9fense valable a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise par l'intim\u00e9 et, la plainte, par cons\u00e9quent, ne peut pas \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e. Subsidiairement, la Commission a le pouvoir de nommer un conciliateur pour tenter d'en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement. Comme troisi\u00e8me possibilit\u00e9, la Commission peut renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour une instruction impliquant l'ensemble des parties, notamment la Commission en tant que repr\u00e9sentante de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[5] Dans le cas d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, le pouvoir de la Commission de conduire son enqu\u00eate comprend le pouvoir de recueillir des donn\u00e9es pertinentes quant \u00e0 un poste. La Commission peut demander des renseignements \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 comme des listes d'employ\u00e9s, des descriptions de poste et des donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 un poste, notamment des commentaires de la part du personnel de supervision et de la part du personnel de gestion ainsi que des entrevues r\u00e9alis\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s d'employ\u00e9s. Elle peut m\u00eame demander \u00e0 se rendre sur place et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des observations.\n[6] La r\u00e9ception des donn\u00e9es sur un poste est cruciale quant \u00e0 l'examen de la plainte par la Commission et quant \u00e0 sa recommandation d\u00e9finitive fond\u00e9e sur les faits dont elle est saisie. La valeur des fonctions effectu\u00e9es par les hommes et les femmes mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie et compar\u00e9e, comme d'ailleurs les salaires du personnel masculin et les salaires du personnel f\u00e9minin. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation doit comprendre l'examen de quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 11(2) de la Loi, soit : les qualifications, les efforts, les responsabilit\u00e9s et les conditions de travail.\n[7] La Commission a comme pratique habituelle d'entreprendre le processus d'\u00e9valuation du travail par l'entremise d'un comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation des postes et en se servant du plan d'\u00e9valuation existant de l'employeur, pourvu que cela soit appropri\u00e9 pour une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de cela, la Commission doit trouver un plan de rechange d'\u00e9valuation des fonctions qui est impartial, sans distinction de genre et qui est appropri\u00e9 pour la t\u00e2che.\n[8] La Commission doit \u00e9galement \u00e9tudier la pertinence du comparateur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi et qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte.\n[9] En bout de ligne, la Commission doit effectuer sa comparaison pr\u00e9liminaire de la valeur des fonctions et des salaires entre le plaignant et le groupe de comparaison mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte. Un rapport d'enqu\u00eate, fond\u00e9 sur les conclusions de la Commission, sera ensuite r\u00e9dig\u00e9. Une fois qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par les parties impliqu\u00e9es, un rapport final d'enqu\u00eate, avec ses recommandations, sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux commissaires de la Commission qui prendront la d\u00e9cision finale concernant l'engagement de la Commission quant \u00e0 la plainte.\n[10] Dans le cas de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e. Cela peut s'expliquer par un certain nombre de raisons.\n[11] D\u00e8s 1982, avant que la plainte ne soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, la plaignante, l'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (l'Alliance), et l'intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Postes Canada) avaient convenu de travailler conjointement \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration d'un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, connu sous le nom de System One.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, au cours de 1984 et au cours de la majeure partie de 1985, la Commission n'a pas poursuivi activement son enqu\u00eate quant \u00e0 la plainte. Elle a plut\u00f4t fait des v\u00e9rifications p\u00e9riodiques quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de l'\u00e9laboration conjointe de System One. Des divergences d'opinion entre l'Alliance et Postes Canada, notamment le retrait de l'Alliance, \u00e0 un certain moment, de sa participation active \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration du processus d'\u00e9valuation, ont entra\u00een\u00e9 de nombreux retards et ont retard\u00e9 la progression de l'\u00e9laboration du plan conjoint System One. Enfin, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9activer son enqu\u00eate en octobre 1985.\n[13] \u00c0 partir de la fin de 1985 et au cours de 1986, la Commission a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration d'une Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, un questionnaire devant servir \u00e0 la cueillette de donn\u00e9es actuelles sur l'emploi quant aux fonctions de la plaignante - des emplois dans le groupe Commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements (CR), un groupe mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine , et quant aux emplois comparateurs choisis - des emplois dans le Groupe des op\u00e9rations postales (PO), un groupe mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine .\n[14] Pendant ce temps, Postes Canada a fait \u00e9tat de pr\u00e9occupations s\u00e9rieuses \u00e0 la Commission quant \u00e0 la conception et quant au contenu de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi envisag\u00e9e. De plus, Postes Canada a fait part de ses r\u00e9serves \u00e0 la Commission quant au processus d'enqu\u00eate en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi devait d'abord \u00eatre remplie par un \u00e9chantillon d'employ\u00e9s appartenant au groupe CR. Elle devait \u00e9ventuellement servir comme moyen principal de cueillette de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pour l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission.\n[15] En m\u00eame temps qu'elle faisait part de ses r\u00e9serves quant au processus d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission, Postes Canada a r\u00e9pondu aux demandes de renseignements sur les donn\u00e9s de l'emploi de la Commission en lui remettant des imprim\u00e9s sur les employ\u00e9s ainsi que d'autres renseignements. Elle a fait une mise en garde \u00e0 savoir que les descriptions d'emploi et les organigrammes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s comme pi\u00e8ces jointes aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi \u00e9taient souvent p\u00e9rim\u00e9s. L'Alliance a inform\u00e9 la Commission que les descriptions d'emploi devraient \u00eatre approuv\u00e9es par le syndicat.\n[16] En d\u00e9cembre 1986 au plus tard, un \u00e9chantillon d'employ\u00e9s CR de Postes Canada avaient rempli la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et avaient eu une entrevue avec le personnel de la Commission en utilisant un guide d'entrevue cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Commission afin de clarifier les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es sur la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi. De plus, durant le processus de l'entrevue, des membres du personnel de supervision pertinent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s afin de clarifier les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par les titulaires d'emploi \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s.\n[17] Entre avril et septembre 1987, un certain nombre de membres du personnel de la Commission ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 l'\u00e9chantillon de 194 postes CR en utilisant les donn\u00e9es recueillies en 1986. System One a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour faire ces \u00e9valuations, malgr\u00e9 qu'il s'ag\u00eet d'un plan non achev\u00e9 et que l'Alliance avait conseill\u00e9 de ne pas l'utiliser \u00e0 des fins d'\u00e9valuation. Ces \u00e9valuations ont \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le processus d'enqu\u00eate final.\n[18] Il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9, entre la fin de 1987 et le milieu de 1991, une longue correspondance ainsi que des r\u00e9unions et des discussions prolong\u00e9es entre la Commission et Postes Canada concernant l'\u00e9chantillonnage du groupe de comparaison PO et la cueillette de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi aupr\u00e8s de ce m\u00eame groupe. La Commission n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir la coop\u00e9ration des syndicats comp\u00e9tents du groupe de comparaison pour recueillir ces renseignements. Toutefois, Postes Canada a \u00e9mis des doutes quant \u00e0 la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon envisag\u00e9 des postes de comparaison PO et a refus\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s PO remplissent la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi durant les heures de travail.\n[19] L'Alliance s'inqui\u00e9tait cependant de plus en plus du peu de progr\u00e8s dans l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission quant \u00e0 la plainte. La Commission a menac\u00e9, au moins \u00e0 deux occasions, d'invoquer l'article 58 de la Loi afin d'obtenir de Postes Canada les renseignements dont elle avait besoin pour continuer son enqu\u00eate. Des r\u00e9unions impliquant des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la Commission et de Postes Canada ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues et ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration, par la Commission, d'un ensemble pr\u00e9liminaire de 10 particularit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9riques d'emplois PO.\n[20] Par la suite, la Commission a pu terminer ses 10 particularit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9riques d'emplois du groupe PO en se fondant sur les donn\u00e9es obtenues de Postes Canada. Cela s'est produit entre juillet et octobre 1991. Bien que Postes Canada ait affirm\u00e9 que l'on avait omis d'englober de nombreux emplois PO lors de la cr\u00e9ation de ces emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , ce probl\u00e8me n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Des faits subs\u00e9quents, comme une gr\u00e8ve du syndicat en ao\u00fbt 1991, ont prolong\u00e9 la dur\u00e9e de l'enqu\u00eate. La Commission est all\u00e9e de l'avant, pouss\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9occupations de l'Alliance qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues \u00e9videntes par sa menace de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une requ\u00eate en mandamus en vertu de la Loi afin d'obliger la Commission \u00e0 terminer son enqu\u00eate. Son personnel a commenc\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation des postes rep\u00e8res CR et PO, apr\u00e8s quoi les 10 emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques PO devaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s et l'\u00e9chantillon original des 194 postes CR devait \u00eatre r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9.\n[21] Au milieu de cette activit\u00e9, l'enqu\u00eateur principal a \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement r\u00e9affect\u00e9 de son poste de chef de l'enqu\u00eate pour s'occuper d'autres priorit\u00e9s. Dans le but d'achever le travail rapidement, les postes de direction PO ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s de la plainte et l'\u00e9chantillon CR a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit de 194 \u00e0 93 postes. Un expert-conseil a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au personnel de la Commission pour le processus d'\u00e9valuation dans lequel on utilisait comme outil d'\u00e9valuation le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay XYZ, lequel est disponible sur le march\u00e9. On n'a pas pu se servir de System One car il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le syndicat et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour servir \u00e0 comparer des emplois repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des syndicats autre que l'Alliance. De plus, Postes Canada avait pr\u00e9venu la Commission que System One n'\u00e9tait pas adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois PO.\n[22] La Commission a termin\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations d'emploi ainsi que son travail d'enqu\u00eate en novembre 1991. Aucune s\u00e9ance d'information n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue avec Postes Canada avant qu'une \u00e9bauche du rapport d'enqu\u00eate ne soit remise aux parties le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1991. Le rapport \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 d'une demande de pr\u00e9sentation d'observations, laquelle devait \u00eatre soumise au plus tard le 6 janvier 1992. Les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e0 la fin de janvier 1992; le rapport d'enqu\u00eate final de la Commission, dat\u00e9 du 24 janvier 1992, ne faisait mention d'aucune d'elles. Le rapport final concluait qu'il existait une diff\u00e9rence \u00e9vidente dans les salaires lorsque l'on comparait les salaires et les valeurs des emplois dans les groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte. Le rapport recommandait le renvoi de la plainte au Comit\u00e9 du tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (maintenant appel\u00e9 Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne).\n[23] Les commissaires ont examin\u00e9 le rapport d'enqu\u00eate final et, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances de la plainte, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 16 mars 1992, de constituer un tribunal pour instruire la plainte au moyen d'un renvoi au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, lequel attribuerait l'affaire \u00e0 une formation sp\u00e9cifique du Tribunal pour une audience.\n[24] La formation du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e le 11 mai 1992, une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 21 septembre 1992 et les audiences et les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations ont commenc\u00e9 le 25 novembre 1992. Les observations \u00e9crites et orales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es le 27 ao\u00fbt 2003, bien que les observations \u00e9crites concernant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c.

Environnement et le contexte (1981 \u00e0 1991) [27] Dans le but de bien comprendre cette longue et complexe affaire, le Tribunal estime qu'il est important que l'environnement et le contexte historique soit d\u00e9crit, notamment ce qui se passait dans le monde dans lequel les trois parties \u00e9voluaient durant les ann\u00e9es cruciales 1981 \u00e0 1991?\n[28] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e le 14 juillet 1977 et est entr\u00e9e en vigueur par proclamation le 1er mars 1978. L'article 11 de la Loi est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 1er mars 1978. Lorsque la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Commission le 24 ao\u00fbt 1983, un certain nombre d'autres plaintes, des plaintes individuelles et des plaintes de groupe, all\u00e9guant la discrimination en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l'Alliance et d'autres syndicats des secteurs public et priv\u00e9. Des tribunaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s pour entendre certaines de ces causes mais la majorit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d'une n\u00e9gociation impliquant des mod\u00e9rateurs, et ce, avec le consentement de la Commission.\n[29] La Loi, laquelle est une loi quasi constitutionnelle portant sur les droits de la personne, \u00e9nonce des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux concernant l'interdiction de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur des motifs particuliers. La Loi a pr\u00e9vu la cr\u00e9ation d'une Commission canadienne des droits de la personne qui s'est vu accorder le pouvoir de participer activement \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution de la Loi par le biais du traitement des plaintes et par l'\u00e9laboration et l'\u00e9mission d'ordonnances en vertu du paragraphe 27(2). De plus, la Commission doit notamment entreprendre ou patronner des programmes de recherche dans les domaines qui ressortissent \u00e0 ses objets et sensibiliser le public \u00e0 l'objet de la Loi, tout en tentant d'emp\u00eacher la perp\u00e9tration des actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s par la Loi. Tout ceci, sans aucun doute, a impos\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but des d\u00e9fis exigeants \u00e0 la Commission ainsi qu'\u00e0 son personnel. Parall\u00e8lement, nous \u00e9tions dans une p\u00e9riode de compressions budg\u00e9taires tant au niveau des gouvernements provinciaux qu'au niveau du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[30] La n\u00e9gociation collective a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite dans la fonction publique du Canada en mars 1967 sous l'\u00e9gide de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique2 (LRTFP), laquelle pr\u00e9voyait que le gouvernement et la Commission de la fonction publique devaient \u00e9dicter et d\u00e9clarer des groupes de cat\u00e9gories d'emploi en vue de syndiquer officiellement les employ\u00e9s du gouvernement. Chaque cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi devait \u00eatre d\u00e9finie par l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des groupes d'employ\u00e9s constituant cette cat\u00e9gorie. Les employ\u00e9s du Bureau de poste, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement canadien, faisaient partie des m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories et des m\u00eames groupes que les employ\u00e9s des autres minist\u00e8res du gouvernement, \u00e0 l'exception des employ\u00e9s qui participaient directement \u00e0 la manutention du courrier. Ce groupe unique \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la manutention du courrier et comprenait les commis aux postes, les facteurs, les exp\u00e9diteurs des postes, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la manutention du courrier surveillants et de nombreux autres employ\u00e9s dont la fonction avait trait au tri et \u00e0 la livraison du courrier.\n[31] La circulation quotidienne de volumes tr\u00e8s importants de diff\u00e9rents types de courrier dans un pays aussi vaste que le Canada, avec ses nombreux fuseaux horaires et ses diff\u00e9rentes conditions climatiques, n\u00e9cessite un vaste r\u00e9seau op\u00e9rationnel bien coordonn\u00e9. Obligatoirement, un tel r\u00e9seau comprend des milliers de personnes appartenant \u00e0 l'entreprise ou des personnes embauch\u00e9es \u00e0 contrat et des milliers de comptoirs postaux dans les r\u00e9gions urbaines et rurales, en plus de nombreuses installations de traitement du courrier dans l'ensemble du pays. L'\u00e9tat des relations avec les employ\u00e9s est de toute \u00e9vidence un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel quant \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 de l'exploitation d'un r\u00e9seau aussi complexe. Avant l'adoption de la LRTFP en 1967 et de l'accr\u00e9ditation ult\u00e9rieure de divers syndicats repr\u00e9sentant des groupes professionnels particuliers d'employ\u00e9s au sein de ce qui s'appelait alors le minist\u00e8re des Postes, les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient surtout repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, officieusement, par des associations de personnel. La plus ancienne de ces associations aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e en 1889.\n[32] Dans les ann\u00e9es 1960 et 1970, le minist\u00e8re des Postes a connu l'une de ses p\u00e9riodes les plus troubl\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail. Bien qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque on ait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance du syst\u00e8me du code postal (1971) et \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution de la technologie du traitement m\u00e9canis\u00e9 du courrier, on a \u00e9galement assist\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreux conflits employeur-employ\u00e9s qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses gr\u00e8ves.\n[33] Le minist\u00e8re des Postes a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes avec la proclamation de la Loi sur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes3 le 16 octobre 1981. L'un des objets vis\u00e9s par la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la loi habilitante, est que dans l'exercice de sa mission la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [...] veille \u00e0 l'autofinancement de son exploitation dans des conditions de normes de service adapt\u00e9es aux besoins de la population du Canada [...] 4. La cr\u00e9ation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat a sembl\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par l'ensemble des partis politiques nationaux et par la plupart des syndicats, des associations de chefs d'entreprise et des organismes de d\u00e9fense des consommateurs. Il semblait \u00e9galement y avoir un consensus que l'un des nombreux objectifs recherch\u00e9s par la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait la r\u00e9forme de sa structure de n\u00e9gociation collective dans le but d'obtenir la paix dans le milieu de travail.\n[34] Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre devenue une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat, les unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation accr\u00e9dit\u00e9es en vertu de la LRTFP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9put\u00e9es \u00eatre des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation en vertu du Code canadien du travail5 et les agents de n\u00e9gociation repr\u00e9sentant ces unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenus dans leurs fonctions, vraisemblablement pour assurer une p\u00e9riode de transition de stabilit\u00e9 relative et pour donner l'occasion \u00e0 la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de se restructurer. Cela a toutefois emp\u00each\u00e9 un d\u00e9marrage rapide de la r\u00e9forme du processus de n\u00e9gociation collective qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage retard\u00e9e par le passage, en 1982, de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le contr\u00f4le des d\u00e9penses de 6 et 5 p. 100. Le Conseil canadien des relations de travail (CCRT) a \u00e9mis, en f\u00e9vrier 1984, un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de politique exigeant un examen global de la structure de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment opportun dans l'avenir. Cet examen a finalement commenc\u00e9 en mai 1985 lorsque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande aupr\u00e8s du CCRT pour que l'on \u00e9tudie la pertinence de l'ensemble de ses unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation alors existantes.\n[35] L'\u00e9tude du CCRT de 1985 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e sous la forme d'un Processus d'examen des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation (PEUN) dont la premi\u00e8re phase des audiences s'est termin\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1987; la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision du CCRT a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1988. Le CCRT a entendu les t\u00e9moignages de 8 syndicats comprenant 26 unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation (repr\u00e9sentant environ 58 000 employ\u00e9s) et a ordonn\u00e9 qu'ils soient tous regroup\u00e9s en quatre syndicats de n\u00e9gociation et quatre unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation. Les quatre syndicats sont les suivants :\nL'Association canadienne des ma\u00eetres de poste et adjoints (ACMPA)\nLe Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP), comprenant l'Union des facteurs du Canada (UFC), la Fraternit\u00e9 internationale des ouvriers en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (FIOE), le groupe Manuvre et hommes de m\u00e9tier, le groupe Services divers, et le STTP originel\nL'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (AFPC) repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s des services administratifs, les employ\u00e9s des services techniques et les employ\u00e9s professionnels, comprenant l'int\u00e9gration de 15 unit\u00e9s distinctes en une seule unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation collective\nL'Association des officiers des postes du Canada (AOPC) repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s d'encadrement op\u00e9rationnel mais excluant les chefs de section et les gestionnaires de premier niveau\n[36] Ce n'est qu'en 1988 que la fusion de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation a eu lieu et les rondes de n\u00e9gociation collective 1989-1992 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les premi\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues avec des repr\u00e9sentants des unit\u00e9s r\u00e9unies - quelque huit ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu le statut de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat. Naturellement, alors que l'\u00e9tude du PEUN \u00e9tait en cours, les n\u00e9gociations entre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les 26 unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation originelles se sont poursuivies. En fait, des n\u00e9gociations actives ont eu lieu durant cette p\u00e9riode avec l'UFC, le STTP, l'ACMPA, l'AOPC et l'AFPC, certaines avec un peu de chevauchement et certaines avec l'aide d'une m\u00e9diation sp\u00e9ciale. Malgr\u00e9 des n\u00e9gociations \u00e9nergiques, trois gr\u00e8ves ont eu lieu dans les ann\u00e9es 1980, dont l'une impliquant l'AFPC.\n[37] Les rondes de n\u00e9gociation 1989-1992 entre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et le STTP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9prouvantes pour l'ensemble des parties et elles ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9, des gr\u00e8ves tournantes et une loi du Parlement de retour au travail en 1991. Des ententes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclues durant cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode avec les trois autres syndicats - l'ACMPA, l'AOPC et l'AFPC - sans arr\u00eats de travail.\nII. Le CONTEXTE L\u00c9GISLATIF A. La nature des lois sur les droits de la personne [38] Les lois sur les droits de la personne ont vu le jour dans les ann\u00e9es 1970. Bien que, au d\u00e9but du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, des demandes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, souvent par des femmes, quant \u00e0 des droits \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, il a fallu des d\u00e9cennies avant que des lois, provinciales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, s'attaquent au probl\u00e8me de la discrimination en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[39] On s'est attaqu\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de la discrimination dans le monde du travail apr\u00e8s la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale lorsque l'Organisation internationale du Travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e en 1919. Vers la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, le gouvernement canadien a adopt\u00e9 une loi pr\u00e9voyant un salaire minimum pour les femmes.\n[40] La D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme6 fut proclam\u00e9e par l'Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations Unies en d\u00e9cembre 1948. Elle fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque comme \u00e9tant la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape dans l'\u00e9laboration d'une Charte internationale des droits de l'homme qui aurait une force l\u00e9gale en plus d'une force morale. L'article 23 de cette D\u00e9claration pr\u00e9voit notamment que [t]ous ont droit, sans aucune discrimination, \u00e0 un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail \u00e9gal .\n[41] D\u00e8s 1951, le principe du salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gal a \u00e9t\u00e9 articul\u00e9 par l'Organisation internationale du Travail dans la Convention sur l`\u00e9galit\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration C1007. Cette convention a \u00e9t\u00e9 ratifi\u00e9e par le Canada en 1972 et a annonc\u00e9 l'engagement du Canada \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre activement les droits de la personne, notamment le principe du salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gal . Cet engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 lorsque le Canada a ratifi\u00e9 le Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels des Nations Unies8, le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques9, et le Protocole facultatif se rapportant au Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques10 en 1976. Ces pactes des Nations Unies ont permis la r\u00e9alisation d'une Charte internationale des droits de l'homme \u00e0 laquelle on r\u00eavait depuis longtemps.\n[42] L'article 7 du Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels reconna\u00eet le droit qu'a toute personne \u00e0 [u]n salaire \u00e9quitable et une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9gale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale sans distinction aucune; en particulier, les femmes doivent avoir la garantie que les conditions de travail qui leur sont accord\u00e9es ne sont pas inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les hommes et recevoir la m\u00eame r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu'eux pour un m\u00eame travail [...] 11.\n[43] En 1970, le Canada a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une Commission royale pour enqu\u00eater sur la situation de la femme. Le rapport de la Commission royale a mis l'accent sur le fait que la discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes existait toujours en milieu de travail12. La participation des femmes \u00e0 la main-d'oeuvre canadienne n'a cess\u00e9 d'augmenter au fil des d\u00e9cennies. Durant la p\u00e9riode de 20 ans qui va de 1960 \u00e0 1979, elle a connu le m\u00eame pourcentage d'augmentation que durant la p\u00e9riode de 60 ans qui va de 1901 \u00e0 1961.\n[44] L'engagement du Canada envers l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination en milieu de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largi afin d'inclure une d\u00e9finition plus large des droits de la personne par la promulgation de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en 1978 et, en 1981, par la signature du Canada de la Convention des Nations Unies sur l'\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes13.\n[45] Les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux vis\u00e9s par les lois sur les droits de la personne sont la pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination et la promotion de l'\u00e9ducation du public quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination. Ces objectifs sont fond\u00e9s sur la croyance de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ses membres. Apr\u00e8s coup, ils sont une tentative de remettre les victimes de discrimination dans leur \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur par une r\u00e9solution consensuelle ou par une r\u00e9solution prescrite. Le juge en chef Dickson a soulign\u00e9 dans Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892 que l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, tel qu'il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2, est l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances ind\u00e9pendamment de consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es notamment sur des pratiques discriminatoires 14.\n[46] Une protection l\u00e9gislative des droits de la personne demande une interpr\u00e9tation des lois qui est large et \u00e0 caract\u00e8re final, faite d' une fa\u00e7on compatible avec leurs objectifs pr\u00e9dominants 15. En d'autres mots une interpr\u00e9tation d'une loi sur les droits de la personne doit favoriser l'objet de ces lois visant \u00e0 \u00e9duquer le public et \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 la discrimination. Pour ce faire, l'interpr\u00e9tation de la loi doit \u00eatre large et il faut \u00e9viter de faire une analyse \u00e9troite, trop technique. On interpr\u00e9tera ainsi les droits pr\u00e9vus dans la loi d'une fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale, tout en interpr\u00e9tant les restrictions et les exceptions de la loi de fa\u00e7on rigoureuse.\n[47] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a soulign\u00e9 dans Winnipeg School Division no 1 c. Craton [1985] 2 R.C.S. 150 :\nqu'[u]ne loi sur les droits de la personne est de nature sp\u00e9ciale et \u00e9nonce une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale applicable \u00e0 des questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elle n'est pas de nature constitutionnelle, en ce sens qu'elle ne peut pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ou abrog\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature. Elle est cependant d'une nature telle que seule une d\u00e9claration l\u00e9gislative claire peut permettre de la modifier, de la r\u00e9viser ou de l'abroger, ou encore de cr\u00e9er des exceptions \u00e0 ses dispositions16.\n[48] Cette caract\u00e9risation de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne comme \u00e9tant quasi constitutionnelle demande une approche r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie et moderne \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation. La remarque suivante, extraite de l'ouvrage d'E.A. Dreidger, intitul\u00e9 Construction of Statutes17 et de celui de Ruth Sullivan, intitul\u00e9 Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes18, montre l'approche moderne, contextuelle \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de la loi :\n[...] il faut lire les termes d'une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s'harmonise avec l'esprit de la loi, l'objet de la loi et l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur19.\nIl n'existe qu'une seule r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation moderne : les tribunaux sont tenus d'interpr\u00e9ter un texte l\u00e9gislatif dans son contexte global, en tenant compte de l'objet du texte en question, des cons\u00e9quences des interpr\u00e9tations propos\u00e9es, des pr\u00e9somptions et des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales d'interpr\u00e9tation, ainsi que des sources acceptables d'aide ext\u00e9rieure. Autrement dit, les tribunaux doivent tenir compte de tous les indices pertinents et acceptables du sens d'un texte l\u00e9gislatif. Cela fait, ils doivent ensuite adopter l'interpr\u00e9tation qui est appropri\u00e9e20.\nLe sens des mots dans un texte l\u00e9gislatif ne d\u00e9pend pas seulement de leur contexte imm\u00e9diat, mais aussi d'un contexte plus large, qui comprend l'ensemble de la Loi et l'ensemble des lois en vigueur. Les pr\u00e9somptions de coh\u00e9rence et d'uniformit\u00e9 d'expression s'appliquent non seulement aux lois traitant d'une m\u00eame mati\u00e8re, mais aussi quoique avec moins de force \u00e0 l'ensemble des lois adopt\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur. [...] Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes choses \u00e9tant \u00e9gales par ailleurs, on retiendra les interpr\u00e9tations qui r\u00e9duisent la possibilit\u00e9 de contradiction ou d'incoh\u00e9rence parmi les diff\u00e9rentes lois21.\n[49] En plus de ces observations, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'utiliser la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation comme l'a fait le juge Iacobucci lorsqu'il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nJe m'appuie \u00e9galement sur l'article 10 de la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation, L.R.O. 1980, ch. 219, qui pr\u00e9voit que les lois sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es apporter une solution de droit et doivent s'interpr\u00e9ter de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9quitable et la plus large qui soit pour garantir la r\u00e9alisation de leur objet selon leur sens, intention et esprit v\u00e9ritables22.\n[50] En plus d'un examen de la nature des lois sur les droits de la personne et des principes r\u00e9sultants de l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois, lorsque le Tribunal examine des lois aussi sp\u00e9ciales, il doit \u00e9galement, durant le processus d\u00e9cisionnel, examiner l'historique de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cet historique est examin\u00e9 dans les prochains paragraphes.\nB. L'historique de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [51] Tel qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 1977 et est entr\u00e9e en vigueur au d\u00e9but de 1978. Bien que plus de 25 ans se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9s, les droits \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 font toujours l'objet d'un litige et d'un d\u00e9bat. La juge L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, dans un discours qu'elle a prononc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un doctorat honorifique du Barreau du Haut-Canada en 2002, a soulign\u00e9 que :\nLes mots se terminant par le suffixe isme ou phobie - racisme, sexisme, homophobie et tout le reste - sont tous des sources de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement. Ils n'ont aucune place en cette \u00e9poque de droits de la personne [...] L'\u00e9galit\u00e9 sera la bataille du mill\u00e9naire. \u00c0 l'occasion, les porte-\u00e9tendards de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 se sentiront seuls et seront durement critiqu\u00e9s en raison de leurs positions. Mais, pour ceux qui font ce qui est bien, la confirmation et la solidarit\u00e9\nviendront en temps opportun. Je crois fermement qu'une justice sans \u00e9galit\u00e9 n'est pas du tout une justice [...] 23.\n[52] L'article 2 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne traite de l'objectif de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. Il mentionne que la Loi a pour objet :\n... [de donner] effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[53] En mai 1977, le ministre de la Justice de l'\u00e9poque, l'honorable Ron Basford, a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit durant les d\u00e9bats parlementaires qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'adoption de la Loi, et plus particuli\u00e8rement l'adoption de l'article 11 de la Loi :\nSans le moindre doute, il y aura certains probl\u00e8mes [...] [avec] le concept [de salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale]. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a adopt\u00e9 une attitude diff\u00e9rente : nous devons l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer quand au principe et, par l'entremise de la Commission et de ses efforts en vue d'\u00e9tablir des lignes directrices, nous pourrons r\u00e9soudre ces prob\u00e8mes [...] indiquant comment mettre cela en application et comment y parvenir24.\n[54] En d'autres mots, l'article 11 de la Loi est un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de principe qui n'impose pas de r\u00e8gles strictes indiquant comment ce principe doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9. L'honorable Ron Basford a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cet article du projet de loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour s'attaquer au probl\u00e8me particulier du cloisonnement professionnel des femmes, avec son historique de taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus faible fond\u00e9 sur la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes sur le march\u00e9. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s'attaquer \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une des raisons sous-jacentes des conventions internationales du milieu du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle et a \u00e9t\u00e9 une recommandation cl\u00e9 du Rapport de la Commission royale d'enqu\u00eate sur la situation de la femme au Canada25.\n[55] Il est ressorti de ces conventions internationales et du Rapport de la Commission royale, la notion tr\u00e8s large qui consiste \u00e0 fixer les salaires en fonction de la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9. L'article 11 de la Loi traite du principe qu'il ne doit y avoir aucune discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en mati\u00e8re de taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Le salaire devrait \u00eatre fix\u00e9 en fonction de la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9.\n[56] Comme l'adh\u00e9sion du Canada aux conventions internationales et aux recommandations de sa propre Commission royale constitu\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par l'article 11 de la Loi, son objet doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 du point de vue historique.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'article 11, bien qu'il soit fond\u00e9 sur les plaintes, comme l'est d'ailleurs la Loi en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la fa\u00e7on du l\u00e9gislateur de s'attaquer \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans le monde de l'emploi.\n[58] Bien que le principe de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale constitue le fondement de l'article 11, celui-ci est silencieux quant \u00e0 son application. Alors que l'article 11 \u00e9nonce \u00e0 l'intention du plaignant les crit\u00e8res qui doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9valuer la valeur du travail - c'est-\u00e0-dire, le dosage des quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : les qualifications, les efforts, les responsabilit\u00e9s et les conditions de travail - il ne dit rien sur le processus d'\u00e9valuation qui doit \u00eatre employ\u00e9.\n[59] La Commission s'est vu conf\u00e9rer un vaste pouvoir pour faire face aux subtilit\u00e9s de l'article 11 comme la capacit\u00e9 de prendre des ordonnances ayant force obligatoire concernant certains concepts figurant dans l'article. Ce pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances cr\u00e9e ce qui peut \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant des r\u00e8gles statutaires servant \u00e0 guider l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11, ce qui ressemble \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de r\u00e8glements pour d'autres lois.\n[60] La plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi appelle une interpr\u00e9tation de l'ensemble des aspects de l'article 11. Il semble que ce soit la premi\u00e8re plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11 de la Loi renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne qui n\u00e9cessite un examen aussi exhaustif.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS FONDAMENTALES [61] Le Tribunal devra examiner quatre questions fondamentales au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'il examine la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Ces questions sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s et seront examin\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans les Sections IV, V et VI.\nA. L'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal [62] Le Tribunal est-il un tribunal quasi judiciaire impartial, ind\u00e9pendant au plan institutionnel? La Loi cr\u00e9e-t-elle notamment une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 institutionnelle de la part du Tribunal parce qu'elle donne \u00e0 la Commission le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances sur la parit\u00e9 salariale26 (les ordonnances) qui lient la Commission, laquelle est partie devant le Tribunal, et qui lient le Tribunal?\nB. La r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 et la validit\u00e9 des ordonnances [63] Une loi peut-elle \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement ou r\u00e9trospectivement? Un pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de prendre des mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es, comme les ordonnances, peut-il \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 r\u00e9troactivement ou r\u00e9trospectivement?\n[64] Quel est le crit\u00e8re applicable quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 des mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es? Le paragraphe 8(2) et les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'ordonnance de 198627 sont-ils valides?\nC. La preuve par pr\u00e9somption [65] Le juge Evans a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nOn peut donc croire que le paragraphe 11(1) a rem\u00e9di\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de la preuve en \u00e9dictant une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle, lorsque les femmes et les hommes re\u00e7oivent un salaire diff\u00e9rent pour ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, cet \u00e9cart est fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, \u00e0 moins qu'il puisse \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un facteur que la Commission a reconnu comme motif raisonnable dans une ordonnance28.\n[66] Bien que toutes les parties dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte accepte cette d\u00e9claration du juge Evans, la question suivante se pose : cette pr\u00e9somption est-elle une pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9futable par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments autres que ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans les ordonnances?\nD. La preuve prima facie\n[67] La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9tabli prima facie une preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11 de la Loi?\n[68] La preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[...] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e929.\n[69] La norme de la preuve que l'on doit utiliser pour d\u00e9cider si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la plaignante est la norme civile, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la plaignante, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e en utilisant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s comme norme de preuve.\nIV. L'EXAMEN DES QUESTIONS FONDAMENTALES A. L'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal [70] Postes Canada a soulev\u00e9 cette question la premi\u00e8re fois en mai 1998 lorsque son avocat nouvellement mandat\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'une requ\u00eate concernant [Traduction] l'ind\u00e9pendance judiciaire et l'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle du Tribunal \u00e9tait examin\u00e9e.\n[71] La question de l'ind\u00e9pendance et de l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que la juge McGillis eut rendu une d\u00e9cision le 23 mars 1998 en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance)30.\n[72] Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'aboutissement d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire d'une d\u00e9cision rendue par le tribunal constitu\u00e9 pour entendre une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi par un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s de Bell Canada et leurs syndicats. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les plaidoiries quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Bell Canada demandant que le tribunal s'estime incapable de poursuivre en raison d'une crainte de partialit\u00e9, le tribunal a conclu qu'il \u00e9tait un organisme quasi judiciaire ind\u00e9pendant, capable sur le plan institutionnel de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'audition d'une affaire d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et conforme aux principes de justice naturelle 31.\n[73] La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la loi, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, ne garantissait pas suffisamment l'inamovibilit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re des membres du tribunal pour permettre au tribunal de fonctionner avec ind\u00e9pendance et impartialit\u00e9. On s'est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 du fait que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des membres du tribunal \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par la Commission, une partie dans presque toutes les instances dont il est saisi. De plus, la juge McGillis a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il existait certaines pr\u00e9occupations concernant la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission de prendre des ordonnances obligatoires. La juge McGillis a fait remarquer, dans une remarque incidente, que le pouvoir de la Commission de rendre des ordonnances pr\u00e9cisant [...] les limites et les modalit\u00e9s de l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi qui lient les tribunaux soul\u00e8ve des craintes quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du tribunal d'agir d'une mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante et impartiale32. Selon la juge McGillis ce probl\u00e8me pourrait \u00eatre corrig\u00e9 en rendant des ordonnances qui ne lient pas le Tribunal.\n[74] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'ensemble des proc\u00e9dures dans la plainte de Bell Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9es et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 qu'aucune autre proc\u00e9dure ne soit engag\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la plainte tant que le l\u00e9gislateur n'aurait pas apport\u00e9 les modifications n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la loi afin de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes pertinents.\n[75] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en juin 1998 et a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nune ordonnance ou une d\u00e9cision de la part du Tribunal selon laquelle il n'est pas un tribunal ind\u00e9pendant ou impartial capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable en conformit\u00e9 avec les principes de justice fondamentale garantis par l'alin\u00e9a 2e) de la D\u00e9claration des droits, L.R.C. 1985, parce que, notamment, il est li\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne par les Ordonnances prises par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, une partie ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l'affaire; une ordonnance ou une d\u00e9cision de la part du Tribunal selon laquelle il n'est pas un tribunal ind\u00e9pendant ou impartial capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable en conformit\u00e9 avec les principes de justice fondamentale garantis par l'alin\u00e9a 2e) de la D\u00e9claration des droits, L.R.C. 1985 parce que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des membres du Tribunal est fix\u00e9e par la Commission et que, du d\u00e9but des audiences du Tribunal jusqu'au 1er janvier 1997, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise sous forme de ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis par la Commission; subsidiairement, une ordonnance du tribunal renvoyant les questions ci-dessus soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu de l'article 18.3 de la Loi sur la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale L.R.C. 1985 ch. F-7 et les articles 320 et 323 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (1998).\n[76] La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue en ao\u00fbt et septembre 1998. Le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 21 octobre 1998 et a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de Postes Canada de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[Traduction]\nEn ce qui concerne la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re dans un tribunal et de l'inamovibilit\u00e9 des membres du Tribunal, le Tribunal conclut qu'il ne fait aucun doute qu'un d\u00e9sistement peut servir comme objection \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, comme en t\u00e9moigne la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e [...]. Un fait est incontestable. \u00c0 aucun moment au cours des six derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, Me Juriansz, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, n'a soulev\u00e9 la question de l'inamovibilit\u00e9 ou de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re du Tribunal [...]. Le Tribunal conclut que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9e aurait su qu'il pouvait contester, de fa\u00e7on opportune, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en raison d'une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de ces deux questions. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme une telle objection n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, pour quelque raison que ce soit, l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir implicitement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de contester l'ind\u00e9pendance ou l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal sur le fondement de ces deux questions33.\n[77] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit quant \u00e0 l'argument de Postes Canada que le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des Ordonnances, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par la Commission, une partie devant le Tribunal, a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une situation o\u00f9 le Tribunal ne pouvait pas accorder une audience \u00e9quitable en conformit\u00e9 avec les principes de justice fondamentale :\n[Traduction]\nEn ce qui concerne le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des Ordonnances pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 27(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal conclut que d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience les parties avaient toutes convenues que cette question devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e lors des conclusions finales, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage de l'ensemble des parties.\nUne autre fa\u00e7on d'envisager cette affaire est que l'exercice du droit de l'intim\u00e9e de contester la question du caract\u00e8re obligatoire des Ordonnances au motif qu'elles invalident l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal, a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9, par consentement, du d\u00e9but des proc\u00e9dures jusqu'\u00e0 la plaidoirie finale, parce que l'ensemble des parties ont convenu qu'il \u00e9tait sage que le Tribunal entende d'abord la preuve de telle sorte qu'il comprenne l'objet vis\u00e9 par les Ordonnances.\nLe droit de l'intim\u00e9e de s'opposer n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9-il a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 et peut toujours \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 la toute fin . Il n'est pas question de renonciation en l'esp\u00e8ce. On a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 rien quant \u00e0 la question des Ordonnances - il ne s'agit que d'un accord que l'on a conclu ouvertement et honn\u00eatement dans le but de traiter cette question plus tard34.\n[78] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a continu\u00e9 d'entendre la preuve.\n[79] Le 30 juin 1998, un certain nombre de modifications \u00e0 la Loi sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur, dont les suivantes :\nLe paragraphe 27(2) pr\u00e9voit que dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que dans un cas ou une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s la Commission peut prendre une ordonnance liant la Commission et le tribunal.\nLe paragraphe 48.2(2) reconna\u00eet qu'un membre du tribunal dont le mandat est \u00e9chu [...] peut, avec l'agr\u00e9ment du pr\u00e9sident, terminer les affaires dont il est saisi .\nLe paragraphe 48.6(1) pr\u00e9voit que les membres du tribunal re\u00e7oivent [...] la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que fixe le gouverneur en conseil plut\u00f4t que les membres du tribunal ont droit [...] \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et aux indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9penses fix\u00e9es par r\u00e8glement administratif de la Commission 35.\n[80] Apr\u00e8s que la Loi fut modifi\u00e9e en juin 1998, le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de reprendre l'audience du tribunal de la plainte de Bell Canada. Bell Canada, toutefois, a maintenu sa position que, m\u00eame avec la modification au paragraphe 27(2) de la Loi, le tribunal \u00e9tait emp\u00each\u00e9 de rendre un jugement ind\u00e9pendant dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s dans lesquels des ordonnances ayant un effet obligatoire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises par la Commission, une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans l'affaire. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu, dans un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision d'avril 199936 de reprendre l'audience de l'affaire Bell Canada, que le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des ordonnances m\u00e8ne in\u00e9vitablement \u00e0 une perception de partialit\u00e9 et de manque d'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle. La juge Tremblay-Lamer de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance) a souscrit \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention. Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue le 2 novembre 2000, on a conclu que le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des ordonnances prises par la Commission \u00e9tait incompatible avec les garanties d'ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle et d'impartialit\u00e9 qui sont essentielles aux pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels du tribunal37.\n[81] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du 24 mai 2001 a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la juge Tremblay-Lamer38. Cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, laquelle a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 26 juin 200339. Elle a conclu que les paragraphes 27(2) et (3) de la Loi, dans leur version modifi\u00e9e, qui ont trait \u00e0 la prise d'ordonnances ayant un effet obligatoire, n'\u00e9taient pas incompatibles avec l'alin\u00e9a 2e) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, L.C. 1960, c. 44, qui pr\u00e9voit qu'une partie a droit \u00e0 une audition impartiale de sa cause, selon les principes de justice fondamentale . Aucun des deux paragraphes n'est incompatible avec le principe constitutionnel de l'ind\u00e9pendance juridictionnelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, on a conclu que ces paragraphes de la Loi n'\u00e9taient pas sans effets ou inapplicables.\n[82] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a examin\u00e9 l'argument particulier de Bell Canada que le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des ordonnances cr\u00e9e une perception d'absence d'ind\u00e9pendance et d'impartialit\u00e9 de la part d'un tribunal qui entend une plainte. De plus, Bell Canada avait pr\u00e9tendu que les ordonnances, cr\u00e9\u00e9es par une partie \u00e0 l'instance, et liant le tribunal, cr\u00e9eraient une crainte de partialit\u00e9. La Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nComme la Commission l'a d'embl\u00e9e reconnu, le pouvoir des ordonnances est limit\u00e9. \u00c0 l'instar d'autres organismes investis d'un pouvoir de l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, la Commission ne peut pas outrepasser le pouvoir qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 et elle est soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire rigoureux [...]. Le Tribunal peut et, en fait, doit refuser d'appliquer les ordonnances qui, \u00e0 son avis, outrepassent les pouvoirs de la Commission parce qu'elles vont \u00e0 l'encontre de ses lois habilitantes, c'est-\u00e0-dire la Loi, la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. Le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi, conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal par le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi, est manifestement un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'examiner des questions de droit, notamment des questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte et \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits : [...] Aucune loi invalide ne lie le Tribunal. De plus, les ordonnances prises par la Commission, comme toute mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, sont assujetties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'effet r\u00e9troactif. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Loi ne contient pas de termes pr\u00e9cis qui traduiraient l'intention de renoncer \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption, aucune ordonnance ne peut s'appliquer r\u00e9troactivement. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un emp\u00eachement majeur \u00e0 toute tentative d'influencer l'issue d'une affaire en cours d'instance devant le Tribunal par la prise d'une nouvelle ordonnance. Enfin, toute partie devant le Tribunal pourrait contester une ordonnance prise par la Commission au motif que celle-ci a agi de mauvaise foi ou dans un but illicite; aucune ordonnance n'est cens\u00e9e primer sur les exigences de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale qui r\u00e9gissent le Tribunal40.\nLe Parlement a de toute \u00e9vidence d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Commission exercerait un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9. Comme tous les pouvoirs de prendre des mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es, le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances que les paragraphes 27(2) et 27(3) conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Commission est rigoureusement limit\u00e9. Nous ne voyons donc pas comment le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances pr\u00e9vu par la Loi am\u00e8nerait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique, \u00e0 croire \u00e0 une r\u00e9elle probabilit\u00e9 de partialit\u00e9 41.\n[83] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'argument concernant l'application des ordonnances et de leur incidence sur l'impartialit\u00e9 et l'ind\u00e9pendance du Tribunal. Cet argument avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 pour la toute fin de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de 1998 de Postes Canada. La longue discussion de la Cour supr\u00eame quant au pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi \u00e0 la Commission de prendre des ordonnances s'applique autant \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pr\u00e9sente qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e.\n[84] Dans sa plaidoirie concernant la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada, Postes Canada a maintenu son point de vue que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame n'avait pas abord\u00e9 la question des tribunaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9s et qui fonctionnaient avant l'adoption des modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi en 1998. Postes Canada a renvoy\u00e9 au premier paragraphe de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Bell Canada dans lequel il est mentionn\u00e9 que la question en litige que la Cour doit trancher est de savoir si le Tribunal est d\u00e9pourvu de l'ind\u00e9pendance et de l'impartialit\u00e9 requises du fait que la Commission a le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances qui lient le Tribunal [. . .] dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s [. . .] .\n[85] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon la pr\u00e9tention de Postes Canada, la Cour supr\u00eame a parl\u00e9 des tribunaux qui existaient apr\u00e8s 1998. Ce n'est que lors des modifications de 1998 que le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances a \u00e9t\u00e9 confin\u00e9 \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s . Avant les modifications de 1998, l'ancien paragraphe 27(2) de la Loi autorisait la prise d'ordonnance dans un cas ou une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s .\n[86] L'argument de Postes Canada \u00e9tait que le Tribunal actuel, cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1992, n'\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Bell Canada.\n[87] La position de la Commission sur cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment trait\u00e9e par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision unanime Territoires du Nord-Ouest c. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada [2001], A.C.F. n\u00d7 791. Au paragraphe 41 de cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale mentionne ce qui suit :\nL'appelant (le gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest) soutient que la disposition modifi\u00e9e porte encore atteinte \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance et \u00e0 l'impartialit\u00e9 du Comit\u00e9 du tribunal des droits de la personne charg\u00e9 d'entendre la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui. L'appelant a tenu pour acquis, \u00e0 juste titre d'apr\u00e8s moi, que le paragraphe 27(3) a, sous sa forme actuelle, une port\u00e9e r\u00e9duite en raison de la modification du paragraphe 27(2) et s'applique \u00e0 l'examen de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui [...] Il est raisonnable dans ces circonstances d'en d\u00e9duire que le l\u00e9gislateur avait l'intention que les nouveaux paragraphes 27(2) et (3) dont la port\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 restreinte continuent de s'appliquer aux enqu\u00eates relatives \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie de cas, comme celui qui nous occupe, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9es avant la modification et poursuivies par la suite, d'autant plus que la modification de 1998 avait un objet r\u00e9parateur et visait \u00e0 \u00e9viter toute atteinte aux r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle. L'effet combin\u00e9 de la loi modificatrice et de la disposition transitoire a \u00e9t\u00e9, d'une part, de restreindre le pouvoir de la CCDP d'\u00e9mettre des directives imp\u00e9ratives \u00e0 des cat\u00e9gories de cas donn\u00e9s et, d'autre part, de faire en sorte que les directives d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mises \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s lient les trois membres du Comit\u00e9 du tribunal des droits de la personne qui ach\u00e8vent l'enqu\u00eate dont il s'agit ici.\n[88] Selon la Commission, la Cour d'appel a conclu que l'article 27 actuel s'appliquait aux proc\u00e9dures de la cause Territoires du Nord-Ouest malgr\u00e9 le fait que son tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 avant les modifications de 1998. Le comit\u00e9 a poursuivi en vertu des dispositions transitoires de la Loi tout en ne portant pas atteinte \u00e0 l'application de la Loi modifi\u00e9e. De plus, aucune ordonnance ayant force obligatoire propre \u00e0 la cause de l'appelant n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par la Commission.\n[89] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, comme la cause Territoires du Nord-Ouest \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par les m\u00eames dispositions que le Tribunal, c'est-\u00e0-dire les dispositions qui existaient avant 1998, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel, laquelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Bell Canada, s'applique \u00e9galement au Tribunal et, de fait, lie ce dernier.\n[90] Tout comme dans la cause Territoires du Nord-Ouest, le Tribunal a poursuivi en vertu des dispositions transitoires et a \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9 par la modification de 1998 \u00e0 l'article 27. Enfin, aucune ordonnance propre \u00e0 la cause n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par la Commission.\n[91] Le Tribunal estime que la pr\u00e9tention de la Commission est plus convaincante et convient que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la cause Territoires du Nord-Ouest est pertinente et le lie dans ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations.\n[92] Le Tribunal, pour l'ensemble des motifs dans la pr\u00e9sente partie, conclut qu'il est un organisme quasi judiciaire ind\u00e9pendant et impartial, capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'audition d'une cause d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et conforme aux principes de la justice fondamentale.\nB. La r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 et la validit\u00e9 des ordonnances (i) Contexte [93] En plus d'\u00eatre une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l'argument de Postes Canada concernant le caract\u00e8re obligatoire des ordonnances en rapport avec l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9galement abord\u00e9, dans sa d\u00e9cision de juin 200342, la question de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 et de la validit\u00e9 des ordonnances.\n[94] Comme il est soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe 82 susmentionn\u00e9, bien que les ordonnances soient d\u00e9crites comme \u00e9tant imp\u00e9ratives , elles ne lient le Tribunal que si elles ne sont pas invalides car aucune loi invalide ne lie le Tribunal . Le Tribunal peut conclure que les ordonnances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par la Commission de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 outrepasser le pouvoir qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 [...][et par cons\u00e9quent] outrepassent les pouvoirs de la Commission parce qu'elles vont \u00e0 l'encontre de ses lois habilitantes, c'est-\u00e0-dire la Loi, la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droit .\n[95] De plus, la Cour a trait\u00e9 de la question de l' effet r\u00e9troactif des ordonnances. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que :\nles ordonnances prises par la Commission, comme toute mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, sont assujetties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'effet r\u00e9troactif. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Loi ne contient pas de termes pr\u00e9cis qui traduiraient l'intention de renoncer \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption, aucune ordonnance ne peut s'appliquer r\u00e9troactivement. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un emp\u00eachement majeur \u00e0 toute tentative d'influencer l'issue d'une affaire en cours d'instance devant le Tribunal par la prise d'une nouvelle ordonnance 43.\n[96] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 : toute partie devant le Tribunal pourrait contester une ordonnance prise par la Commission au motif que celle-ci a agi de mauvaise foi ou dans un but illicite 44.\n[97] En se fondant sur son interpr\u00e9tation de la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'effet r\u00e9troactif, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu, devant le Tribunal, que les ordonnances qui doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont celles qui \u00e9taient en vigueur au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 1983. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'argument est que seule les Ordonnances de 1978 sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (l'OER de 1978) (modifi\u00e9e en 1982)45 devrait pr\u00e9senter un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal dans le cadre de son processus d\u00e9cisionnel.\n[98] De plus, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que, si le Tribunal rejette ses pr\u00e9tentions concernant l'effet r\u00e9troactif et accepte que l'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale (l'OPS de 1986) est pertinente quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, un certain nombre des dispositions de l'OPS de 1986 devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es invalides. Postes Canada conteste le paragraphe 8(2) ainsi que les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986.\n[99] Aucune ordonnance n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e pour le motif qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9e de mauvaise foi ou dans un but illicite. Les ordonnances ne sont promulgu\u00e9es qu'une fois que la Commission a re\u00e7u les commentaires de divers groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eats comme les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les organismes gouvernementaux et les minist\u00e8res gouvernementaux. En l'esp\u00e8ce, parmi les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es qui ont activement donn\u00e9 des conseils \u00e0 la Commission avant la promulgation de l'OPS de 1986, on retrouve Postes Canada.\n(ii) En quoi le concept de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 est-il pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte? a) Observations des parties [100] Toutes les parties conviennent dans leurs observations concernant l'effet r\u00e9troactif, que, comme Postes Canada l'a affirm\u00e9 dans ses observations : [Traduction] la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 comporte la question de savoir quelle loi s'applique \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis dans le temps 46.\n[101] Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 Postes Canada dans ses observations concernant la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9, les auteurs en droit administratif, tels Sullivan et Dreidger, ont \u00e9crit des livres sur l'effet r\u00e9troactif de la loi. Selon les propos de l'avocat de Postes Canada [Traduction] une application r\u00e9troactive d'une loi modifie les effets ant\u00e9rieurs d'une situation ant\u00e9rieure, la situation donnant lieu aux effets est ant\u00e9rieure et les effets sont ant\u00e9rieurs 47.\n[102] Postes Canada poursuit en soulignant que :\n[Traduction]\nune application r\u00e9trospective de la loi modifie les effets futurs de situations ant\u00e9rieures, la situation qui nous int\u00e9resse est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9e mais ses effets ne sont pas tous pass\u00e9s. Un certain nombre d'effets appara\u00eetront dans l'avenir et si la loi peut les modifier, alors il s'agit d'une application r\u00e9trospective [...] Une application imm\u00e9diate de la loi modifie les effets futurs d'une situation courante [...] la loi s'applique \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 elle entre en vigueur. Alors la loi s'applique \u00e0 tout ce qui arrive apr\u00e8s [...] l'application prospective de la loi, o\u00f9 la loi qui entre en vigueur ne peut s'appliquer qu'aux situations et aux effets qui surviennent apr\u00e8s [...] Qu'en est-il des situations qui ont commenc\u00e9 avant que la loi entre en vigueur? [...] l'ancienne loi survit, la loi qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e, l'ordonnance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e, s'appliquent, mais dans le seul but de r\u00e9gir des situations, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles prennent fin [...] Donc, m\u00eame si la Loi mentionne que les ordonnances sont r\u00e9voqu\u00e9es lorsque de nouvelles ordonnances sont prises [...] le concept de survie l'emporte sur cela et on laisse l'ancienne loi s'appliquer si cela est n\u00e9cessaire parce que la nouvelle loi n'est que prospective 48.\n[103] Ces observations de Postes Canada soulignent les diff\u00e9rentes applications de la loi en fonction du moment que Postes Canada a appel\u00e9 situations et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que la loi applicable \u00e0 ces situations soit utilis\u00e9e. Dans son argumentation, Postes Canada a insist\u00e9 sur le pr\u00e9judice que subirait un intim\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait incapable de savoir, avec pr\u00e9cision, quelle \u00e9tait la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui. Selon Postes Canada, sans cette connaissance, un intim\u00e9 serait priv\u00e9 de la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre pleinement \u00e0 la plainte. Le devoir d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers tous est le fondement de la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'effet r\u00e9troactif. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, selon Postes Canada, les r\u00e8gles du jeu doivent \u00eatre connues avant que le jeu commence : c'est-\u00e0-dire, un intim\u00e9 doit savoir quelle loi s'applique au moment o\u00f9 il re\u00e7oit la signification d'une plainte, \u00e0 moins que la loi ne pr\u00e9voit en termes explicites un changement au beau milieu du jeu.\n[104] Cet argument a devanc\u00e9 l'examen de l'effet r\u00e9troactif fait par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada de juin 2003. Cette d\u00e9cision a tout particuli\u00e8rement soulign\u00e9 l'absence d'inclusion dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne d'une intention que les ordonnances soient appliqu\u00e9es r\u00e9troactivement. Par cons\u00e9quent, les ordonnances ne peuvent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es r\u00e9troactivement.\n[105] Si les ordonnances ne peuvent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es r\u00e9troactivement, quelle est la situation qui d\u00e9termine le moment o\u00f9 une ordonnance pr\u00e9cise doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e? Lors de ses observations sur ce point, Postes Canada a donn\u00e9 l'exemple hypoth\u00e9tique d'une entente contractuelle relative \u00e0 un emploi d'\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyant un salaire horaire minimum qui est modifi\u00e9e par une loi au beau milieu de l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans un tel cas, le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration change lorsque la loi est promulgu\u00e9e, peu importe l'entente contractuelle. Le nouveau taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ne s'applique pas de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9but du contrat. Cet exemple comporte de la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9. Il y a un contrat. Il y a une modification pr\u00e9cise apport\u00e9e par la loi \u00e0 compter d'une date pr\u00e9cise. Il n'y a pas de zone grise dans l'exemple. Aucune all\u00e9gation de discrimination ne fait partie de l'\u00e9quation.\n[106] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9e, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'y avait aucune zone grise dans la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi. La date \u00e0 laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Commission devrait \u00eatre la date qui fixe la loi applicable \u00e0 la plainte. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'un intim\u00e9 doit savoir quelle loi est applicable au moment o\u00f9 il est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une plainte. Selon Postes Canada, cela est important parce que, \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 une plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, un intim\u00e9 doit savoir quelles sont les r\u00e8gles qui s'appliquent afin d'articuler sa position. Durant l'enqu\u00eate sur une plainte, la position de l'intim\u00e9 sera influenc\u00e9 par ces r\u00e8gles . Selon Postes Canada, si les r\u00e8gles font l'objet d'une modification apr\u00e8s qu'une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 subira un pr\u00e9judice.\n[107] Postes Canada a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que l'emploi de l'OPS de 1986 porterait atteinte \u00e0 son droit acquis de se fier aux d\u00e9fenses dont elle disposait en vertu de l'OER de 1978 au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. En particulier, Postes Canada a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. c. Ministre du Revenu national49, pour \u00e9tayer la position que peu importe que la loi ait ou non un effet r\u00e9troactif ou un effet r\u00e9trospectif, il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'il n'y a aucune intention de porter atteinte aux droits acquis (\u00e0 moins que le l\u00e9gislateur ait voulu qu'il en soit autrement).\n[108] Selon Postes Canada, la protection des droits acquis est renforc\u00e9e par la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans laquelle le mot abrogation comprend une loi ou un r\u00e8glement. L'alin\u00e9a 43c) de la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n43. L'abrogation, en tout ou en partie, n'a pas pour cons\u00e9quence [...]\nc) [...] de porter atteinte aux droits ou avantages acquis, aux obligations contract\u00e9es ou aux responsabilit\u00e9s encourues sous le r\u00e9gime du texte abrog\u00e9.\n[109] Postes Canada a soutenu que l'on porterait atteinte \u00e0 ses droits acquis si l'OPS de 1986 \u00e9tait applicable parce qu'elle impose au Tribunal des r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi qui diff\u00e8rent suffisamment des r\u00e8gles de l'OER de 1978 pour que la d\u00e9fense de Postes Canada soit affect\u00e9e. Postes Canada a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 un certain nombre de ces diff\u00e9rences qui, selon elle, entra\u00eeneraient un r\u00e9sultat injuste.\n[110] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, toutes les parties ont convenu qu'il existe une pr\u00e9somption allant \u00e0 l'encontre de l'application r\u00e9troactive de la loi, sauf disposition contraire dans la loi habilitante. La Commission a \u00e9galement convenu que, dans le contexte de mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es, il existe une restriction l\u00e9gale, plut\u00f4t qu'une pr\u00e9somption, qui interdit une telle application.\n[111] De plus, la Commission a convenu avec Postes Canada que la d\u00e9finition d'application r\u00e9troactive est l'application d'une nouvelle loi \u00e0 des faits pass\u00e9s. La Commission, a toutefois soulign\u00e9 que les faits doivent avoir pris fin.\n[112] En renvoyant \u00e0 l'application de la loi dans le temps, la Commission s'est appuy\u00e9e dans ses observations sur les \u00e9crits du professeur Sullivan quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de situer les faits dans le temps :\n[Traduction]\nLa loi a clairement un effet r\u00e9troactif si elle s'applique \u00e0 des faits qui ont tous pris fin avant qu'elle n'entre en vigueur. La loi a clairement un effet prospectif si elle s'applique \u00e0 des faits qui ont tous commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Mais, qu'en est-il des faits en cours, des faits en progr\u00e8s? Il s'agit soit de faits continus, qui ont commenc\u00e9 mais qui n'ont pas encore pris fin lorsque la loi entre en vigueur, soit de faits successifs, un certain nombre s'\u00e9tant produit avant et un certain nombre s'\u00e9tant produit apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi. L'application de la loi \u00e0 des faits en cours n'est pas r\u00e9troactive parce que [...] on ne tente pas de s'immiscer dans le pass\u00e9 et de modifier la loi ou les droits des personnes \u00e0 compter d'une date ant\u00e9rieure50 [...] (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[113] Selon la Commission, il est par cons\u00e9quent important de d\u00e9terminer l'ensemble des faits particuliers qui sont pertinents au cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans la cause dont le Tribunal est saisi, il s'agit de savoir quels faits \u00e9taient en jeu lorsque l'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que les faits pertinents \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9taient clairement en cours parce que la plainte traite d'une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique.\n[114] S'inspirant encore une fois des \u00e9crits du professeur Sullivan, la Commission a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nUne telle application [\u00e0 des faits en cours] peut avoir une incidence sur les droits et les int\u00e9r\u00eats existants, mais il ne s'agit pas d'une application r\u00e9troactive. On dit de la loi qui s'applique \u00e0 des faits en cours qu'elle a un effet imm\u00e9diat 51 [...]\n[115] La Commission a insist\u00e9 sur la nature continue de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en renvoyant \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du juge Hugessen :\nLa discrimination syst\u00e9mique est un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne continu [...] Par sa nature m\u00eame, elle s'\u00e9tend sur une certaine p\u00e9riode52.\n[116] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a conclu que lorsque l'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur, elle s'appliquait imm\u00e9diatement et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 tous les faits en cours - c'est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 des faits qui ont commenc\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9, qui se d\u00e9roulent au moment pr\u00e9sent et qui continueront de se d\u00e9rouler dans l'avenir. Les faits en cause dans une all\u00e9gation de discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique seraient des faits continus.\n[117] La Commission, a de plus pr\u00e9tendu, que l'OPS de 1986 n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 de nouvelles cons\u00e9quences juridiques \u00e0 des faits pass\u00e9s et n'a pas modifi\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences juridiques pass\u00e9es de faits pass\u00e9s. Il ne s'agissait donc pas d'une application r\u00e9troactive de l'OPS de 1986. L'OPS de 1986 a plut\u00f4t codifi\u00e9 la pratique qui a cours \u00e0 la Commission quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[118] Quant \u00e0 la position de Postes Canada selon laquelle l'utilisation de l'OPS de 1986 porterait atteinte \u00e0 ses droits acquis, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le concept de droits acquis ne trouve pas facilement application dans le domaine de l'arbitrage des droits de la personne. La Commission a soulign\u00e9 que la seule jurisprudence \u00e0 laquelle Poste Canada a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de sa position avait trait \u00e0 des faits pertinents qui s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans le pass\u00e9, sauf que ces faits s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans un contexte de responsabilit\u00e9 civile. Cette situation se d\u00e9marque nettement de la plainte qui a trait \u00e0 des faits continus qui se d\u00e9roulent dans un contexte de droits de la personne.\n[119] La Commission a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu qu'il est difficile de voir comment l'OPS de 1986 pourrait porter atteinte \u00e0 des droits pr\u00e9existants ou imposer de nouvelles obligations \u00e0 Postes Canada, parce que l'OPS ne fait qu'interpr\u00e9ter et pr\u00e9ciser des droits et des obligations qui existaient avant son adoption. Elle ne m\u00e8ne en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 des modifications \u00e0 la loi.\n[120] De plus, la Commission a fait valoir que l'OPS de 1986 n'a enlev\u00e9 aucun des moyens de d\u00e9fense reconnus ant\u00e9rieurement par l'OER de 1978 que Postes Canada aurait pu d\u00e9sirer invoquer. En fait, l'OPS de 1986 a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste des facteurs raisonnables que l'on retrouve dans l'OER de 1978, mais Postes Canada n'a invoqu\u00e9 aucun des moyens de d\u00e9fense de facteur raisonnable . Par cons\u00e9quent, la modification apport\u00e9e dans l'OPS de 1986 quant aux facteurs raisonnables n'\u00e9tait pas quelque chose qui a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la position de Postes Canada.\n[121] La Commission a fait remarquer que la pr\u00e9somption voulant qu'on ne peut porter atteinte \u00e0 des droits acquis comporte normalement de l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois ou des r\u00e8glements. La pr\u00e9tention de la Commission \u00e9tait qu'il n'y avait aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le pouvoir r\u00e9glementaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 27 de la Loi indique clairement que l'ordonnance est d'application imm\u00e9diate :\n27(3) Les ordonnances prises en vertu du paragraphe (2) lient, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles soient abrog\u00e9es ou modifi\u00e9es, la Commission et le membre instructeur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu du [...] (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[122] Enfin, la Commission a fait valoir que m\u00eame s'il y avait eu ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, la pr\u00e9somption voulant qu'on ne peut porter atteinte \u00e0 des droits acquis ne fait que prot\u00e9ger les droits qui \u00e9taient acquis au moment de modification \u00e0 la loi ou au r\u00e8glement. Non seulement la port\u00e9e juridique des droits acquis est importante, mais les questions de politiques d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui sont soulev\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9somption sont \u00e9galement importantes.\n[123] En 2001, le juge Marceau a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit dans Veale c. Law Society of Alberta : [Traduction] Il n'existe pas de d\u00e9finition concr\u00e8te de ce qui constitue un droit acquis , principalement parce qu'il est difficile de faire une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation applicable \u00e0 tous les cas car chaque cas doit \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9 individuellement 53. En parlant de l'examen de loi r\u00e9trospective, le juge Marceau a mentionn\u00e9 que les juges sont souvent confront\u00e9s \u00e0 un dilemme - [Traduction] [...] appliquer la nouvelle loi am\u00e9lior\u00e9e pour le plus grand bien, m\u00eame si cela peut \u00eatre injuste envers certaines personnes, ou retarder l'application de cette loi par respect pour certaines personnes en raison de l'injustice dont elles seraient victimes 54.\n[124] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'OPS de 1986 avantage le plus grand bien en apportant des d\u00e9tails grandement n\u00e9cessaires sur la proc\u00e9dure quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi, tout en ne cr\u00e9ant aucune injustice \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Postes Canada.\n[125] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, la Commission a conclu que la pr\u00e9somption voulant qu'on ne peut porter atteinte \u00e0 des droits acquis ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nb) Analyse du Tribunal [126] Postes Canada pr\u00e9cise clairement sa position que ni une loi, ni une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement et la date \u00e0 laquelle la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Commission devrait \u00eatre la date qui fixe la loi applicable. Postes Canada a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que l'OPS de 1986 porterait atteinte \u00e0 son droit acquis d'invoquer les moyens de d\u00e9fense dont elle disposait en vertu de l'OER de 1978, laquelle \u00e9tait en vigueur lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 1983. En cons\u00e9quence, l'OER de 1978 devrait l'emporter.\n[127] En d'autres termes, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que ses observations \u00e9taient conformes au point de vue exprim\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada selon lequel les ordonnances peuvent influencer \u00e0 bon droit le r\u00e9sultat de causes \u00e0 venir dans lesquelles personne, notamment la Commission, ne peut pr\u00e9voir qui verra ses int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers avantag\u00e9s par les ordonnances. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que les ordonnances pourraient influencer ind\u00fbment le r\u00e9sultat d'une cause o\u00f9 leur incidence particuli\u00e8re est d\u00e9j\u00e0 connue et leur application est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par le choix de la Commission quant au moment du renvoi devant un tribunal. En cons\u00e9quence, le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la Commission d'appliquer une ordonnance \u00e0 une plainte sur laquelle elle enqu\u00eate d\u00e9j\u00e0 lorsqu'elle prend l'ordonnance.\n[128] Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que le raisonnement de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada \u00e9taye sa position que l'OPS de 1986 ne devrait pas s'appliquer \u00e0 la plainte parce que cela permettrait \u00e0 la Commission d'influencer ind\u00fbment son r\u00e9sultat. La Commission enqu\u00eatait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur la plainte lorsque l'OPS de 1986 est apparue. Par sa d\u00e9cision de prendre l'OPS de 1986 avant de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal, la Commission, selon l'observation de Postes Canada, a contr\u00f4l\u00e9 ce que le Tribunal serait tenu d'appliquer \u00e0 la plainte car elle savait quelle serait l'incidence probable de l'OPS sur le r\u00e9sultat de la plainte.\n[129] Fait int\u00e9ressant, alors que Postes Canada, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses observations (p. 14 et 15) que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame [Traduction] [...] appuie fortement la position de Postes Canada que l'OPS de 1986 ne devrait aucunement s'appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte parce que cela permettrait \u00e0 la Commission d'influencer ind\u00fbment son r\u00e9sultat , Postes Canada n'a donn\u00e9 aucun exemple d'influence indue de la part de la Commission, m\u00eame pas un simple indice d'influence indue. Elle parle tout simplement d'une menace possible d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, de la cr\u00e9ation d'une possible partialit\u00e9 ou impartialit\u00e9, et ce, sans que cela ne soit fond\u00e9.\n[130] Tout en \u00e9tant d'accord avec Postes Canada qu'il existe une pr\u00e9somption allant \u00e0 l'encontre de l'application r\u00e9troactive de la loi et qu'il existe une restriction l\u00e9gale quant aux mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, en conformit\u00e9 avec la th\u00e8se du professeur Sullivan, la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi a trait \u00e0 des faits en cours. Ces faits en cours ont trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de disparit\u00e9 salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au sens de l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[131] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'application de la loi, notamment de mesures l\u00e9gislatives subordonn\u00e9es, \u00e0 des faits en cours n'est pas r\u00e9troactive parce qu'il n'y a aucune tentative de modifier une loi ant\u00e9rieure ou les droits de personnes \u00e0 compter d'une date ant\u00e9rieure. La position de la Commission est que la loi ou les r\u00e8glements qui s'appliquent \u00e0 des faits en cours ont un effet imm\u00e9diat, non r\u00e9troactif.\n[132] Quant au point soulev\u00e9 par Postes Canada que l'on porterait atteinte \u00e0 ses droits acquis si l'OPS de 1986 \u00e9tait applicable, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 cette inqui\u00e9tude en l'absence de toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de la loi et de l'OPS. La Commission \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d'avis que Postes Canada n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'OPS de 1986 avait retir\u00e9 tout moyen de d\u00e9fense reconnu ant\u00e9rieurement dans l'OER de 1978 que Postes Canada aurait pu d\u00e9sirer invoquer, du moins en ce qui concerne les essentiels facteurs raisonnables .\n[133] La plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi comporte une all\u00e9gation de disparit\u00e9 salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe aux termes de l'article 11 de la Loi. Cette all\u00e9gation en est une de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. L'article 11 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en utilisant, comme fondement premier, la Convention no 100 de 1951 de l'Organisation internationale du travail (ratifi\u00e9 par le Canada en 1972) ainsi que les recommandations du Rapport de la Commission royale d'enqu\u00eate sur la situation de la femme55. Ces documents historiques traitaient de la question de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l'endroit des femmes dans le domaine des salaires et recommandaient fondamentalement que les salaires soient tous fond\u00e9s sur la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9.\n[134] La discrimination syst\u00e9mique a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie de la mani\u00e8re suivante par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes c. C.N., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114 \u00e0 la page 1139 :\n[...] la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, c'est la discrimination qui r\u00e9sulte simplement de l'application des m\u00e9thodes \u00e9tablies de recrutement, d'embauche et de promotion, dont ni l'une ni l'autre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement con\u00e7ue pour promouvoir la discrimination. La discrimination est alors renforc\u00e9e par l'exclusion m\u00eame du groupe d\u00e9savantag\u00e9, du fait que l'exclusion favorise la conviction, tant \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur qu'\u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du groupe, qu'elle r\u00e9sulte de forces naturelles , par exemple que les femmes ne peuvent tout simplement pas faire le travail (voir le rapport Abella, aux pages 9 et 10). Pour combattre la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, il est essentiel de cr\u00e9er un climat dans lequel tant les pratiques que les attitudes n\u00e9gatives peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es et d\u00e9courag\u00e9es [...]\n[135] La discrimination qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte est donc, par d\u00e9finition, en cours.\n[136] En traitant de la question de l'effet r\u00e9troactif, Postes Canada et la Commission ont renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Gustavson Drilling et au livre du professeur Sullivan Driedger on the Construction of Statutes56. Un certain nombre de ces renvois ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s plus haut, mais, compte tenu de la complexit\u00e9 du sujet, le Tribunal estime qu'il est opportun d'examiner d'une mani\u00e8re plus approfondie les \u00e9crits pertinents du professeur Sullivan.\n[137] Le professeur Sullivan affirme que les mots r\u00e9troactif et r\u00e9trospectif sont souvent utilis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on interchangeable mais on a de plus en plus tendance \u00e0 d\u00e9finir loi r\u00e9troactive comme \u00e9tant une loi qui s'applique \u00e0 des faits pass\u00e9s et qui modifie les cons\u00e9quences juridiques pass\u00e9es de transactions conclues. Une loi r\u00e9trospective modifie les cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 venir de transactions compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en imposant de nouvelles obligations57. Le Tribunal accepte l'utilisation du mot r\u00e9troactif tel que d\u00e9fini par le professeur Sullivan.\n[138] Le professeur Sullivan mentionne que l'arr\u00eat Gustavson Drilling de 1977 a confirm\u00e9 qu'il existe une forte pr\u00e9somption qu'une loi n'est pas cens\u00e9e \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive \u00e0 des faits qui se sont produits avant que la loi soit entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Si on veut appliquer ce principe, le professeur Sullivan \u00e9crit qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer quels faits sont pertinents \u00e0 la loi et de les situer dans le temps par rapport \u00e0 la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi.\n[139] Les faits pertinents sont la situation factuelle de la cause, laquelle, en l'esp\u00e8ce, comprend la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique.\n[140] La situation des faits dans le temps, selon le mod\u00e8le du professeur Sullivan, consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la situation factuelle est \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, continue ou successive. Sullivan d\u00e9finit ces choix :\n[Traduction]\n[...] La situation factuelle \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re consiste en des faits qui commencent et qui se terminent dans une courte p\u00e9riode de temps, comme des actes ou des \u00e9v\u00e8nements. Les faits sont termin\u00e9s et font partie du pass\u00e9 aussit\u00f4t que les actes ou les \u00e9v\u00e8nements se terminent; les cons\u00e9quences juridiques se rattachant \u00e0 la situation factuelle sont fix\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de ce moment.[...]\n[...] La situation factuelle continue consiste en un ou plusieurs faits qui se d\u00e9roulent pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode de temps. Un fait continu peut \u00eatre une situation, un statut ou une relation qui peut perdurer. Lorsque aucune limite de temps n'est mentionn\u00e9e, une situation factuelle continue se poursuit et ne fait pas partie du pass\u00e9 tant que la situation factuelle elle-m\u00eame - la situation, l'\u00e9tat ou la relation - n'a pas pris fin.[...]\n[...] La situation factuelle successive consiste en des faits, \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res ou continus, qui se produisent \u00e0 des moments distincts. Une situation factuelle, d\u00e9finie en termes de faits successifs, n'est pas termin\u00e9e et ne fait pas partie du pass\u00e9 tant que le dernier fait de la s\u00e9rie, \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re ou continu, n'est pas termin\u00e958.[...]\n[141] Le professeur Sullivan poursuit en affirmant que d\u00e8s que la situation factuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e - et, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal estime qu'il s'agit d'une situation factuelle continue - les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans la jurisprudence doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s aux faits pertinents. Une application n'est r\u00e9troactive que si tous les faits pertinents \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s lorsque la mesure l\u00e9gislative est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. En ce qui concerne une situation comme la discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique continue all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la mesure l\u00e9gislative (en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'OPS de 1986) n'est r\u00e9troactive que si la situation a pris fin avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la disposition. Manifestement, la position de la Commission, appuy\u00e9e par l'Alliance, est que la pr\u00e9tendue situation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique n'avait pas pris fin lorsque l'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\n[142] L'application d'une mesure l\u00e9gislative, qu'il s'agisse d'une loi ou d'une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, \u00e0 des faits continus ou \u00e0 des faits en progr\u00e8s, n'est pas r\u00e9troactive selon le professeur Sullivan parce que [Traduction] [...] pour employer les mots du juge Dickson dans l'arr\u00eat Gustavson Drilling, on ne cherche pas \u00e0 s'immiscer dans le pass\u00e9 et \u00e0 modifier le droit ou les droits d'une personne \u00e0 compter d'une date ant\u00e9rieure 59.\n[143] Le professeur Sullivan poursuit en affirmant :\n[Traduction]\nLa loi qui s'applique \u00e0 des faits en cours est cens\u00e9e avoir un effet imm\u00e9diat. Son application est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et imm\u00e9diate : imm\u00e9diate en ce sens que la nouvelle r\u00e8gle s'applique \u00e0 partir de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur et d\u00e9loge la r\u00e8gle qui \u00e9tait autrefois applicable aux faits pertinents, et g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en ce sens que la nouvelle r\u00e8gle s'applique \u00e0 tous les faits pertinents, en cours de m\u00eame que nouveaux60.\n[144] Bien que Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'utilisation de l'OPS de 1986 pour interpr\u00e9ter l'article 11 de la Loi pour une plainte qui remonte \u00e0 1983 \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 appliquer cette ordonnance r\u00e9troactivement, le Tribunal estime que l'on ne traite pas en l'esp\u00e8ce de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de l'OPS de 1986. On traite de ce que le professeur Sullivan a appel\u00e9 une situation factuelle continue. Lorsque l'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur elle s'est appliqu\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 tous les faits en cours qui avaient commenc\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 et qui se sont poursuivis dans le pr\u00e9sent et dans l'avenir. Cela comprenait tous les faits en cause dans la pr\u00e9tendue discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique.\n[145] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l'OPS de 1986 ne s'applique pas r\u00e9troactivement en l'esp\u00e8ce mais s'applique \u00e0 une situation en cours et continue sans \u00eatre injuste envers Postes Canada, ni sans lui faire subir un pr\u00e9judice.\n[146] Il convient d'examiner l'argument de la Commission, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada eut rendu sa d\u00e9cision en juin 2003 dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le moment pertinent \u00e0 retenir pour savoir quelle loi s'applique \u00e0 une plainte est la date de son renvoi \u00e0 un tribunal. Ce moment a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par la Commission comme \u00e9tant [Traduction] le moment de cristallisation .\n[147] La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, d\u00e8s que le renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, les nouvelles ordonnances prises par la Commission durant la vie d'un tribunal ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 la plainte renvoy\u00e9e. S'il en \u00e9tait autrement, l'application des nouvelles ordonnances serait r\u00e9troactive, ce qui serait clairement inacceptable.\n[148] La Commission a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada [Traduction] [...] semble accepter la position prise par la Commission devant la Cour que la date du renvoi constitue la ligne de d\u00e9marcation pertinente 61. Cet argument de la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 47 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'affaire Bell Canada. Il est reconnu dans ce paragraphe que les ordonnances, comme toute mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, sont assujetties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'effet r\u00e9troactif. La Cour supr\u00eame a mentionn\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9somption est [...] un emp\u00eachement majeur \u00e0 toute tentative d'influencer l'issue d'une affaire en cours d'instance devant le Tribunal par la prise d'une nouvelle ordonnance 62.\n[149] Dans ses arguments quant \u00e0 ce m\u00eame arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame, Postes Canada a soulign\u00e9 que la Cour supr\u00eame, tout en d\u00e9clarant que le principe qu'aucune ordonnance ne peut s'appliquer r\u00e9troactivement, n'a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la date du renvoi \u00e0 un tribunal est le moment qui sert \u00e0 \u00e9tablir quelle loi s'applique \u00e0 une plainte. La Cour, selon l'argument de Postes Canada, n'a fait que donner un exemple d'un cas hypoth\u00e9tique examin\u00e9 par un tribunal et a mentionn\u00e9 que la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 ne pouvait pas s'appliquer car il serait inappropri\u00e9, dans un tel exemple, de permettre \u00e0 la Commission d'influencer l'issue de la cause en promulguant une nouvelle ordonnance. Dans ces circonstances, la Commission serait \u00e0 la fois partie devant le tribunal et partie devant l'organisme qui r\u00e9dige la nouvelle ordonnance, laquelle, selon la Loi, lierait le tribunal.\n[150] Le Tribunal estime que c'est l'argument de Postes Canada qui est le plus convaincant. Le Tribunal n'estime pas que la Cour supr\u00eame a accept\u00e9 dans son arr\u00eat dans l'affaire Bell Canada que la date de renvoi d'une plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne constitue la ligne de d\u00e9marcation pertinente quant \u00e0 savoir quelle loi s'applique \u00e0 une plainte. La Cour supr\u00eame a plut\u00f4t donn\u00e9 un exemple \u00e9vident pour illustrer que le pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances de la Commission est limit\u00e9 et ne peut pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 r\u00e9troactivement. De plus, l'exemple souligne les observations de la Cour supr\u00eame selon lesquels il est toujours loisible \u00e0 une partie de s'interroger sur l'opportunit\u00e9 du pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances, et ce, pour le motif que l'ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de mauvaise foi ou pour un motif ill\u00e9gitime.\n[151] Postes Canada a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que ni la Commission, ni l'Alliance ne peut invoquer, \u00e0 juste titre ou en droit, l'OPS de 1986 en traitant la plainte parce que ce recours porterait atteinte aux droits acquis de Postes Canada d'invoquer les moyens de d\u00e9fense dont elle pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1983.\n[152] Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que l'OPS de 1986 impose au Tribunal des r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi, lesquelles r\u00e8gles diff\u00e8rent, d'une mani\u00e8re qui est importante pour les moyens de d\u00e9fense de Postes Canada, des r\u00e8gles qui pr\u00e9valaient dans l'OER de 1978. L'un des trois exemples de ces diff\u00e9rences mentionn\u00e9es par Postes Canada \u00e9tait la possibilit\u00e9, dans l'OER de 1978, d'inclure, dans l'\u00e9valuation d'emplois, la valeur des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou des primes de travail par quarts. Comme l'OPS de 1986 interdit cette inclusion, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que la derni\u00e8re ordonnance a enlev\u00e9 un moyen de d\u00e9fense qui \u00e9tait acquis \u00e0 Postes Canada \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Selon Postes Canada, il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une injustice.\n[153] Comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, la Commission, dans ses observations sur les droits acquis, a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le juge Marceau en 2001 dans laquelle il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] [...] il n'existe pas de d\u00e9finition concr\u00e8te de ce qui constitue un droit acquis principalement parce qu'il est difficile de faire une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation \u00e0 partir de la jurisprudence et que chaque cas doit \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9 individuellement 63. Il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que les juges sont souvent confront\u00e9s \u00e0 un dilemme lorsqu'ils sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 se pencher sur la question des droits acquis et peuvent devoir trancher en fonction du plus grand bien 64.\n[154] La prise de d\u00e9cision en fonction du plus grand bien apporte une autre dimension \u00e0 l'analyse. Par exemple, y-a-t-il des caract\u00e9ristiques dans l'OPS de 1986 qui favorisent davantage le plus grand bien par rapport aux caract\u00e9ristiques de l'OER de 1978? Cela peut-il \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sans commettre une injustice \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'une ou l'autre partie?\n[155] Le professeur Sullivan d\u00e9clare ce qui suit dans son examen des droits acquis :\n[Traduction]\nPour \u00e9valuer la force probante de la pr\u00e9somption voulant qu'on ne puisse porter atteinte aux droits acquis, il faut avant tout \u00e9valuer le degr\u00e9 d'injustice que l'atteinte entra\u00eenerait dans des cas particuliers. Lorsque la restriction ou l'abolition d'un droit semble particuli\u00e8rement arbitraire ou injuste, les cours de justice exigent une preuve convaincante que l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9voyait et d\u00e9sirait ce r\u00e9sultat. Lorsque l'ing\u00e9rence est moins pr\u00e9occupante, la pr\u00e9somption est facilement repouss\u00e9e65.\n[156] Le Tribunal s'est par cons\u00e9quent demand\u00e9 la question suivante : La promulgation de l'OPS de 1986 a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 injuste pour Postes Canada, compte tenu que la plainte date de 1983? La promulgation constitue-t-elle un empi\u00e8tement sur les droits acquis de Postes Canada?\n[157] Le Tribunal estime que la p\u00e9riode de 1983 \u00e0 1986 fait partie du continuum qui constitue la vie de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Ces trois ann\u00e9es ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es isol\u00e9ment mais doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le contexte de la situation factuelle continue qui existait au moment o\u00f9 l'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\n[158] En 1986, malgr\u00e9 que peu de chose ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli entre les parties dans l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, l'ensemble des parties se sont tenues mutuellement inform\u00e9s du travail qui se faisait et qui avait une incidence sur la plainte. Par exemple, Postes Canada et l'Alliance ont continu\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de System One comme outil d'\u00e9valuation des postes occup\u00e9s par les employ\u00e9s du groupe commis aux \u00e9critures et aux r\u00e8glements \u00e0 Postes Canada. La Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de ce travail.\n[159] De plus, durant cette p\u00e9riode, Postes Canada et l'Alliance ont particip\u00e9 activement aux efforts faits par la Commission en vue d'obtenir des donn\u00e9es pour son processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. En fait, on avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des entrevues d'employ\u00e9s du groupe CR juste avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'OPS de 1986 en novembre de cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\n[160] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli que l'OPS de 1986 n'a pas d'effet r\u00e9troactif et ne tente nullement de modifier une loi ant\u00e9rieure ou les droits de quiconque \u00e0 compter d'une date ant\u00e9rieure. L'OPS de 1986 s'applique plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la situation factuelle en cours avec effet imm\u00e9diat.\n[161] L'OPS de 1986 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 18 novembre 1986, bien avant que la Commission ait renvoy\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte pour audience au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne le 16 mars 1992. La Commission avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les discussions entre les parties tout au long du stade de l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. Plusieurs des sujets discut\u00e9s par les parties avant 1986 ont \u00e9ventuellement fait partie de l'OPS de 1986, comme par exemple la question des groupes professionnels et des m\u00e9thodes d'\u00e9valuation des postes, y compris le crit\u00e8re permettant d'\u00e9tablir l'\u00e9quivalence des fonctions.\n[162] Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ont bien compris la plainte telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement r\u00e9dig\u00e9e. Bien que l'OPS de 1986 repr\u00e9sente un changement important par rapport \u00e0 l'OER de 1978, sa mise en application n'a fait que codifier un certain nombre des proc\u00e9dures de la Commission avec lesquelles les parties avaient eu affaire depuis la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Le libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de la plainte, illustre la nature historique de ces proc\u00e9dures car il parle de groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine ou masculine et de salaires vers\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 ces groupes. Ces proc\u00e9dures ne font pas partie de la Loi ni de l'OER de 1978. Elles font toutefois partie de l'OPS de 1986.\n[163] Un pr\u00e9judice ou une injustice r\u00e9elle se produirait si, comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a mentionn\u00e9, l'ordonnance qui \u00e9tait pertinente \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9j\u00e0 renvoy\u00e9e pour audience par un tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le renvoi de la plainte \u00e0 ce tribunal. M\u00eame dans le cas de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, la Commission pourrait, par promulgation d'ordonnances durant la vie d'un tribunal, en influencer leurs issues. Ce n'est pas ce qui s'est produit en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[164] En ce qui concerne l'exemple, sous l'OPS de 1986, de violation de droits acquis donn\u00e9 par Postes Canada, notamment l'exclusion de la valeur du travail des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou des primes de travail par quarts, le Tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l'observation de la Commission. La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses observations qu'il s'agit d'un exemple de compromis de politique neutre. La plaignante n'inclut pas les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou la prime de travail par quarts dans la valeur des salaires, alors que l'employeur n'inclut pas les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou le travail par quarts dans la valeur en points de l'emploi. Il ne s'agit pas d'un exemple de retrait d'un moyen de d\u00e9fense pouvant \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 par Postes Canada.\n[165] En termes de l'argument du plus grand bien , le Tribunal accepte que la promulgation par la Commission de l'OPS de 1986 \u00e9tait une tentative de pr\u00e9cision grandement n\u00e9cessaire quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi, et ce, sans injustice \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'une ou l'autre partie. La cr\u00e9ation de l'ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e apr\u00e8s de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de consultation avec des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et des organismes, notamment Postes Canada. Le Tribunal accepte que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de cr\u00e9er une nouvelle ordonnance en 1986 visait \u00e0 favoriser le plus grand bien .\n[166] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne comprend pas en quoi l'introduction de l'OPS de 1986 apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 une source d'injustice ou de pr\u00e9judice pour Postes Canada, une violation de ses droits acquis ou en quoi elle a exerc\u00e9 une influence indue sur l'issue de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[167] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l'OPS de 1986 est applicable aux questions qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es dans la plainte actuelle. La question de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de cette ordonnance ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi. Les faits impliqu\u00e9s sont des faits en cours ou continus et, \u00e0 ce titre, ne soul\u00e8vent aucune pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9. De plus, le Tribunal estime qu'il n'y a aucune violation des droits acquis de Postes Canada en raison du caract\u00e8re applicable de l'OPS de 1986.\n(iii) Le paragraphe 8(2) et les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986 sont-ils valides? a) Observations des parties [168] Toutes les parties conviennent que l'ordonnance est une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu de pouvoir accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne par l'article 27 de la Loi et, \u00e0 ce titre, ne doit pas entrer en conflit avec la Loi. Il existe toutefois une pr\u00e9somption qu'une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e est valide. Lorsqu'une partie conteste une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, cette partie a le fardeau de convaincre le d\u00e9cideur que la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e contest\u00e9e est invalide. La question \u00e0 laquelle le d\u00e9cideur doit r\u00e9pondre est une question de droit.\n[169] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, Postes Canada a contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du paragraphe 8(2) et des articles 11 \u00e0 15 inclusivement de l'OPS de 1986 parce que, selon elle, une simple lecture de la Loi donnant une signification simple au libell\u00e9 de la Loi, en particulier \u00e0 l'article 11, cr\u00e9e une contradiction avec le libell\u00e9 et la signification des articles contest\u00e9s de l'OPS de 1986. C'est ce manque de coh\u00e9sion entre le libell\u00e9 et la signification de l'article 11 de la Loi, tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par Postes Canada et le libell\u00e9 et la signification des articles de l'OPS de 1986, la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e, qui cr\u00e9e, selon Postes Canada, une situation o\u00f9 la Commission n'a pas exerc\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re raisonnable son pouvoir en vertu de l'article 27 de la Loi et ainsi a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'invalidit\u00e9 de ces articles de l'OPS de 1986.\n[170] Les observations des parties ont trait\u00e9 de ce qui constituerait une m\u00e9thode acceptable pour d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l'ordonnance. Une fois que l'argument concernant le crit\u00e8re de validit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu, des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par chacune des parties concernant sa position quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'ordonnance contest\u00e9e par Postes Canada.\n[171] Postes Canada et la Commission ont toutes les deux renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Oldman River66 dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada traitait de l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois, surtout dans le contexte d'une situation o\u00f9 deux lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e de l'ordre d'une ordonnance sont impliqu\u00e9es.\n[172] Citant des extraits de l'ouvrage du professeur Ruth Sullivan, Postes Canada a enjoint le Tribunal de s\u00e9parer la loi habilitante et ses r\u00e8glements (l'ordonnance en l'esp\u00e8ce) avant de statuer sur la validit\u00e9 de ces derniers. Postes Canada a cit\u00e9 l'extrait suivant tir\u00e9 de l'ouvrage de Sullivan :\n[Traduction]\nLes lois ont priorit\u00e9 sur les r\u00e8glements [...] La pr\u00e9somption de coh\u00e9rence s'applique tant aux r\u00e8glements qu'aux lois. On pr\u00e9sume que les dispositions r\u00e9glementaires sont cens\u00e9es fonctionner ensemble, non seulement avec leur propre loi habilitante mais \u00e9galement avec les autres lois et les autres r\u00e8glements67.\n[173] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que, lorsqu'il v\u00e9rifie la validit\u00e9 d'une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e contest\u00e9e, une ordonnance en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal doit d'abord interpr\u00e9ter la loi habilitante, puis appr\u00e9cier la validit\u00e9 des articles contest\u00e9s de l'ordonnance. Postes Canada a estim\u00e9 que cette m\u00e9thodologie est diff\u00e9rente de celle \u00e0 laquelle adh\u00e8re la Commission.\n[174] L'argument de la Commission concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi en pr\u00e9sence d'une contestation d'une mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e s'appuie \u00e9galement sur l'arr\u00eat Oldman River. La Commission a cit\u00e9 le passage suivant afin de souligner ses observations concernant le crit\u00e8re qui doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 des articles contest\u00e9s de l'ordonnance :\nOn ne met pas en doute les principes fondamentaux du droit. Il ne peut y avoir incompatibilit\u00e9 entre le texte r\u00e9glementaire et la loi en vertu de laquelle il est adopt\u00e9 [...] pas plus qu'il ne peut y en avoir avec les autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales [...] sauf si la loi l'autorise [...] Normalement, la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit l'emporter sur le texte r\u00e9glementaire incompatible. Toutefois, en mati\u00e8re d'interpr\u00e9tation, un tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8rera, dans la mesure du possible, une interpr\u00e9tation\nqui permet de concilier les deux textes. Dans ce contexte, l' incompatibilit\u00e9 renvoie \u00e0 une situation o\u00f9 le texte l\u00e9gislatif et le texte r\u00e9glementaire ne peuvent \u00eatre concili\u00e9s68.\n[175] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Oldman River et \u00e0 l'ouvrage du professeur Sullivan, la pr\u00e9somption de coh\u00e9rence pr\u00e9sume que les dispositions r\u00e9glementaires fonctionnent bien avec leur loi habilitante ainsi qu'avec les autres lois et r\u00e8glements.\n[176] Dans son observation, la Commission a attir\u00e9 l'attention sur ce qu'elle avait per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant l'argument de Postes Canada que cette pr\u00e9somption de coh\u00e9sion dispara\u00eet d\u00e8s qu'il y a eu contestation de la validit\u00e9 de la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que si c'\u00e9tait le cas, on ne reconna\u00eetrait plus l'importance de la recherche de la conciliation des diff\u00e9rences comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Oldman River.\n[177] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il importe peu que l'on adopte la m\u00e9thode qui consiste \u00e0 lire conjointement la l\u00e9gislation habilitante et la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e ou la m\u00e9thode de Postes Canada qui consiste \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter d'abord la loi habilitante, puis \u00e0 examiner la mesure l\u00e9gislative. La partie importante de l'exercice consiste \u00e0 voir s'il y a coh\u00e9rence entre les deux niveaux de loi.\n[178] Commen\u00e7ons cet exercice d'interpr\u00e9tation par la lecture de l'article 11 et des paragraphes 27(2), (3) et (4) de la Loi ainsi que des dispositions contest\u00e9es de l'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, c'est-\u00e0-dire le paragraphe 8(2) et les articles 11, 12, 13, 14 et 15 :\nLoi canadienne sur les droits de la personne\nDisparit\u00e9 salariale discriminatoire\n11(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes.\nCrit\u00e8re\n11(2) Le crit\u00e8re permettant d'\u00e9tablir l'\u00e9quivalence des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des salari\u00e9s dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement est le dosage de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaire pour leur ex\u00e9cution, compte tenu des conditions de travail.\n\u00c9tablissements distincts\n11(3) Les \u00e9tablissements distincts qu'un employeur am\u00e9nage ou maintient dans le but principal de justifier une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre hommes et femmes sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent article, ne constituer qu'un seul et m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement.\nDisparit\u00e9 salariale non discriminatoire\n11(4) Ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire au sens du paragraphe (1) la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre hommes et femmes fond\u00e9e sur un facteur reconnu comme raisonnable par une ordonnance de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vertu du paragraphe 27(2).\nIdem\n11(5) Des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur le sexe ne sauraient motiver la disparit\u00e9 salariale.\nDiminutions de salaire interdites\n11(6) Il est interdit \u00e0 l'employeur de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des diminutions salariales pour mettre fin aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s au pr\u00e9sent article.\nD\u00e9finition de salaire\n11(7) Pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent article, salaire s'entend de toute forme de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration payable \u00e0 un individu en contrepartie de son travail et, notamment\na) des traitements, commissions, indemnit\u00e9s de vacances ou de licenciement et des primes;\nb) de la juste valeur des prestations en repas, loyers, logement et h\u00e9bergement;\nc) des r\u00e9tributions en nature;\nd) des cotisations de l'employeur aux caisses ou r\u00e9gimes de pension, aux r\u00e9gimes d'assurance contre l'invalidit\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e et aux r\u00e9gimes d'assurance-maladie de toute nature;\ne) des autres avantages re\u00e7us directement ou indirectement de l'employeur.\nPouvoirs et fonctions (de la Commission)\nDirectives\n27(2) Dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s, la Commission peut, sur demande ou de sa propre initiative, d\u00e9cider de pr\u00e9ciser, par ordonnance, les limites et les modalit\u00e9s de l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nEffet obligatoire\n27(3) Les ordonnances prises en vertu du paragraphe (2) lient, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elles soient abrog\u00e9es ou modifi\u00e9es, la Commission et le membre instructeur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 49(2) lors du r\u00e8glement des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la partie III.\nPublication\n27(4) Les ordonnances prises en vertu du paragraphe (2) et portant sur les modalit\u00e9s d'application de certaines dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi \u00e0 certaines cat\u00e9gories de cas sont publi\u00e9es dans la partie II de la Gazette du Canada.\nL'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale\n\u00c9quivalence des fonctions -

Selon cette derni\u00e8re approche, le d\u00e9cideur doit lire les termes d'une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s'harmonise avec l'esprit de la loi, l'objet de la loi et l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur 69 .\n[180] Au paragraphe 11(1), ce sont les mots les hommes et les femmes qui ont d\u00e9clench\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence marqu\u00e9e d'interpr\u00e9tation entre les parties. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que ces mots, lourds de cons\u00e9quences pour l'ensemble de l'article 11, ont un sens clair. L'article parle de discrimination entre des hommes ou des femmes et non pas entre des groupes de personnes compos\u00e9s d'hommes et de femmes. La discrimination est fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et se manifeste dans une diff\u00e9rence entre les salaires pay\u00e9s aux hommes et femmes concern\u00e9s.\n[181] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'article 11 de la Loi s'attache principalement \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe entre des hommes et des femmes, laquelle discrimination s'exerce par une disparit\u00e9 entre les salaires pay\u00e9s par l'employeur \u00e0 ces hommes et \u00e0 ces femmes pour le travail qu'ils ex\u00e9cutent. Si on accepte cette interpr\u00e9tation, les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986 doivent \u00eatre invalides parce qu'ils n'ont aucun rapport avec l'article 11 de la Loi. Le paragraphe 11(1), ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, ne parle pas de groupes professionnels et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de d'\u00e9tablir la composition de ces groupes selon le sexe afin de les classer comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine ou comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine . Par cons\u00e9quent, les buts vis\u00e9s par les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986 ne pourraient aucunement \u00eatre atteints. Ces articles repr\u00e9senterait la promulgation par la Commission d'ordonnances qui ne sont pas compatibles avec la loi habilitante. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles seraient invalides.\n[182] Selon ses observations, l'interpr\u00e9tation fond\u00e9e sur le sens ordinaire du paragraphe 11(1) pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par Postes Canada est ainsi formul\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nconstitue un acte discriminatoire [...] quelque chose d'interdit, le fait pour un employeur d'instaurer et de pratiquer, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'\u00e9tablir ou de cr\u00e9er un certain pouvoir d'\u00e9tablir ou de pratiquer une disparit\u00e9 salariale, c'est-\u00e0-dire le versement de salaires plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s et de salaires moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s [...] entre deux personnes, deux groupes de personne, des employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et des employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin [...] entre des employ\u00e9s qui sont de sexe masculin et des employ\u00e9s qui sont de sexe f\u00e9minin [...] qui travaillent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement [...] [ce qui] signifie qu'ils sont vis\u00e9s par une m\u00eame politique en mati\u00e8re de salaire et de personnel [...] il existe une disparit\u00e9 salariale qui est interdite si les employ\u00e9s, les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions, leurs fonctions individuelles, qui sont \u00e9quivalentes [...]70\n[183] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'une plainte, fond\u00e9e sur une telle interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11, pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par toute personne, homme ou femme, ou par tout groupe d'hommes ou de femmes, sans avoir \u00e0 subir la contrainte de barri\u00e8res artificielles \u00e9rig\u00e9es \u00e0 l'encontre de personnes qui travaillent dans des groupes professionnels et dont la fonction est class\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant sans discrimination sexuelle ou de sexe masculin . Le m\u00e9canisme de la plainte deviendrait plus accessible \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Loi, lequel vise \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination fond\u00e9e, notamment, sur le sexe, serait avanc\u00e9. Selon Postes Canada, la restriction, laquelle est cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission de l'article 11, notamment dans sa promulgation des articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'ordonnance, serait enlev\u00e9e.\n[184] Toutefois, ce qui est plus important, selon Postes Canada, la transformation apparente par la Commission du sens ordinaire du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi en une interpr\u00e9tation compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rente du concept de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale par l'utilisation de l'ordonnance. Au lieu d'examiner la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans le domaine des salaires, la Commission, selon Postes Canada, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'article 11 comme s'attachant principalement \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes dans des groupes professionnels s\u00e9par\u00e9s. En d'autres termes, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'article 11 de la Loi s'attache au concept de parit\u00e9 salariale . D\u00e8s que la Commission eut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9ter l'article 11 de cette mani\u00e8re, elle devait d\u00e9finir les groupes professionnels.\n[185] Le fondement des observations de Postes Canada concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi est que l'article ne traite pas de parit\u00e9 salariale . Les fonctions \u00e9quivalentes qui doivent \u00eatre compar\u00e9es afin de prouver l'acte discriminatoire d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par l'article 11 sont les fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par chacun des hommes et chacune des femmes touch\u00e9s par la plainte. L'article ne traite pas de fonctions de groupes professionnels compos\u00e9s d'hommes et de femmes qui effectuent des fonctions de femmes ou des fonctions d'hommes .\n[186] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que son interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 est une \u00e9volution naturelle, si on regarde l'histoire, de la l\u00e9gislation qui traitait de la discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes au travail. La premi\u00e8re loi du genre, adopt\u00e9e au d\u00e9but du XXe si\u00e8cle, avait trait \u00e0 un salaire minimum pour les femmes au travail. Cette loi fut suivie, des d\u00e9cennies plus tard, par une loi d\u00e9non\u00e7ant la pratique qui consistait \u00e0 verser aux femmes des salaires moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, ou essentiellement \u00e9quivalentes, \u00e0 des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes. Bien que cette \u00e9volution naturelle pouvait \u00e9ventuellement mener au concept de parit\u00e9 salariale , l'argument de Postes Canada est que l'article 11 ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un mouvement sur le continuum qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point.\n[187] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'on ne peut pas affirmer que l'article 11 de la Loi traite du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Postes Canada a soulign\u00e9, dans son argument final, que la l\u00e9gislation provinciale concernant la parit\u00e9 salariale est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise. Il existe habituellement dans les provinces une loi distincte intitul\u00e9e Loi sur la parit\u00e9 salariale . Le concept n'est pas incorpor\u00e9 dans les lois provinciales sur les droits de la personne parce que, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elles ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur les plaintes. Il s'agit plut\u00f4t d'un concept obligatoire comportant des m\u00e9thodologies et des r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises quant \u00e0 sa mise en oeuvre.\n[188] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que le processus de traitement de la parit\u00e9 salariale tire ses id\u00e9es de la doctrine et de la documentation qui sont apparues \u00e0 propos de ce concept abstrait. La m\u00e9thodologie est fond\u00e9e sur des classes d'emplois qui sont \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine parce que l'objet des \u00e9tudes sur la parit\u00e9 salariale , et, ult\u00e9rieurement, la l\u00e9gislation sur la parit\u00e9 salariale , consiste \u00e0 corriger les iniquit\u00e9s qui sont apparues dans le monde de l'emploi en raison d'un cloisonnement professionnel et de la sous-\u00e9valuation des postes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Toutefois, Postes Canada a poursuivi en soulignant que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne s'attache \u00e0 la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes, laquelle disparit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, et non pas au concept large de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Selon Postes Canada, la Loi [Traduction] s'attache \u00e0 la protection des personnes contre les inconv\u00e9nients ou la discrimination engendr\u00e9s par les caract\u00e9ristiques fondamentales des personnes .\n[189] Selon Postes Canada, la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9e au profit des personnes dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. L'objet de la Loi, tel qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2, souligne que cette loi sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour donner effet au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus [...] \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement [...] . Les motifs de discrimination qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Loi sont des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles. L'article 3 de la Loi mentionne express\u00e9ment que la liste des motifs vaut pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi . Au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'on lit la Loi, les articles se suivent en parlant de personnes ou d' employ\u00e9s .\n[190] Ce point commun est rompu par l'article 11 de la Loi qui ne parle pas d'un employ\u00e9 ou d'un groupe d'employ\u00e9s, mais parle de discrimination affectant des hommes et des femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes . Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que c'est cette modification dans le libell\u00e9 qui lui fait prendre conscience que cet article particulier traite de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique car il refl\u00e8te les pr\u00e9occupations suivantes du l\u00e9gislateur, notamment [Traduction] y-a-t-il discrimination syst\u00e9mique, y-a-t-il une tendance dans l'ensemble de l'\u00e9tablissement \u00e0 pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes .\n[191] Postes Canada a soulign\u00e9 dans ses observations qu'elle accepte que l'article 11 traite de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, mais a pr\u00e9tendu que cette acceptation ne signifie pas qu'elle accepte que les plaintes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es que par des groupes. En effet, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que des plaintes individuelles fond\u00e9es sur des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[192] L'avocat de Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] s'il s'agit de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et s'il s'agit d'hommes et de femmes qui travaillent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, vous prenez les salaires des femmes qui travaillent dans l'\u00e9tablissement et vous prenez les salaires des hommes qui travaillent dans l'\u00e9tablissement, puis vous comparez le travail et les salaires des hommes et des femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Si on constate une tendance \u00e0 la disparit\u00e9 salariale, alors il y a contravention71.\n[193] Selon Postes Canada, cette comparaison ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec le processus d'\u00e9valuation, lequel est, soit obligatoire, soit suivi, lorsque l'on traite de questions de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Ce processus comporte le plus souvent une comparaison de la valeur du travail de groupes de personnes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes ou des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes .\n[194] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le juge Evans, \u00e0 ce moment juge \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, section de premi\u00e8re instance, a rendu une d\u00e9cision qui fait autorit\u00e9 dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor72, notamment que l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission selon laquelle l'article 11 traite de la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale , comme en atteste la promulgation de l'OPS de 1986, est juste. En r\u00e9ponse, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'acceptation par le juge Evans de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission (et l'utilisation de l'OPS de 1986) \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans cette cause avaient accept\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation. Comme l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission de l'article 11, la pr\u00e9somption de validit\u00e9 de l'ordonnance n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Postes Canada a soulign\u00e9 que les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le juge Evans ne doivent \u00eatre accept\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal comme n'\u00e9tant que \u00e7a - c'est-\u00e0-dire des commentaires qui peuvent \u00eatre utiles au Tribunal alors qu'il \u00e9labore sa d\u00e9cision concernant la question en litige et non pas des commentaires qui lient le Tribunal.\n[195] De plus, le juge Evans a comment\u00e9 longuement quant \u00e0 la viabilit\u00e9 de l'article 14 de l'Ordonnance, lequel traite des groupes professionnels, dans le contexte de l'article 11 de la Loi. L'interpr\u00e9tation de cet article particulier \u00e9tait la principale question qui devait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par le tribunal qui a entendu la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a examin\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision. Le juge Evans a fait allusion aux commentaires formul\u00e9s par le juge Hugessen dans la cause Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale73, et, par cons\u00e9quent, selon la Commission, ces commentaires devraient avoir de l'importance quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation par le Tribunal de l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[196] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans sa d\u00e9cision de juin 2003 dans l`affaire Bell, a conclu que la Commission a le pouvoir, en vertu de l'article 27 de la Loi, de prendre des ordonnances qui sont analogues \u00e0 des r\u00e8glements. Selon la Commission, cette d\u00e9cision a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption que l'ordonnance est valide.\n[197] Tout comme une contestation de r\u00e8glements promulgu\u00e9s, une contestation de la validit\u00e9 de l'ordonnance est difficile. Les cours de justice pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent accepter que la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre concili\u00e9e avec sa loi habilitante. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que, si il accepte l'interpr\u00e9tation de Postes Canada, le Tribunal devrait conclure qu'il existe une incompatibilit\u00e9 d'application entre la Loi et l'ordonnance et qu'il n'y a aucune possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9soudre le conflit.\n[198] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le choix de Postes Canada de commencer son argument d' acceptation courante avec les mots employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et f\u00e9minin \u00e9vite la v\u00e9ritable signification de l'article 11. La Commission a fond\u00e9 ses observations sur l'\u00e9volution historique du concept de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale ainsi que sur les commentaires formul\u00e9s par les cours. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait cela, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devrait accepter l'interpr\u00e9tation faite par la Commission de l'article 11 de la Loi comme \u00e9tant l'\u00e9nonciation par le l\u00e9gislateur du principe de la parit\u00e9 salariale . La Commission a de plus observ\u00e9 que le l\u00e9gislateur a trait\u00e9 de la difficult\u00e9 engendr\u00e9e par l'examen du concept abstrait de la parit\u00e9 salariale en donnant \u00e0 la Commission les outils pour rendre ce principe fonctionnel. Ces outils comprennent la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission de promulguer des ordonnances en conformit\u00e9 avec l'article 27 de la Loi.\n[199] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a promulgu\u00e9 ses ordonnances en conformit\u00e9 avec l'objet de la parit\u00e9 salariale vis\u00e9 par la Loi. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'objet d'une telle loi est de palier au cloisonnement professionnel des femmes et au paiement discriminatoire de salaires moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 ces groupes cloisonn\u00e9s pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale au travail effectu\u00e9 par des groupes principalement compos\u00e9s d'hommes. Le principal objet de l'article 11 de la Loi, selon la Commission, devrait \u00eatre le travail qui est effectu\u00e9 ainsi que sa valeur et non pas le sexe des employ\u00e9s qui effectuent le travail.\n[200] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, selon cette interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale, les articles 12 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986 repr\u00e9sentent la m\u00e9thodologie qui doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour faire du principe de l'article 11 une th\u00e9orie qui fonctionne. Ces articles de l'OPS sont tout \u00e0 fait li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi et fait fonctionner ensemble les domaines de la loi pour cr\u00e9er un ensemble coh\u00e9rent qui constitue le fondement pour le travail d'\u00e9valuation qui doit \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir si une plainte peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e.\n[201] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, malgr\u00e9 les arguments cat\u00e9goriques de Postes Canada selon lesquels son interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi est large et \u00e0 caract\u00e8re final et est plus lib\u00e9rale dans sa capacit\u00e9 d'englober tout plaignant, l'interpr\u00e9tation de Postes Canada m\u00e8nerait, elle, \u00e0 des conclusions \u00e9troites et restrictives. Son interpr\u00e9tation ne traite pas du concept large de parit\u00e9 salariale qui est ce que la loi vise \u00e0 traiter depuis son origine.\n[202] Selon les arguments de la Commission, l'interpr\u00e9tation de Postes Canada limiterait le processus d'\u00e9valuation \u00e0 une m\u00e9thodologie unique. Seule l'approche de la comparaison entre les postes pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e. Seul un examen de l'ensemble du syst\u00e8me pourrait \u00eatre fait dans le processus d'\u00e9valuation, m\u00eame si la plaignante \u00e9tait une seule personne. Bien que Postes Canada eut conc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'un \u00e9chantillonnage repr\u00e9sentatif pourrait \u00eatre fait lors de l'\u00e9tape de l'\u00e9valuation, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de Postes Canada cr\u00e9erait une m\u00e9thodologie encombrante qui serait, en fait, d'une nature r\u00e9gressive.\nb) Analyse du Tribunal [203] L'ensemble des parties ont cit\u00e9, dans ses nombreuses versions, des extraits de l'ouvrage de Sullivan intitul\u00e9 Driedger on the Construction of Statutes. Le Tribunal convient que ce travail est lourd de cons\u00e9quence lorsque l'on a affaire avec l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois. Il convient de souligner les commentaires de Driedger sur ce qu'il a intitul\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle moderne de l'interpr\u00e9tation :\n[Traduction]\nAujourd'hui il n'y a qu'un seul principe ou solution : il faut lire les termes d'une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s'harmonise avec l'esprit de la loi, l'objet de la loi et l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur74.\nIl n'existe qu'une seule r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation moderne : les cours de justice sont tenus d'interpr\u00e9ter un texte l\u00e9gislatif dans son contexte global, en tenant compte de l'objet du texte en question, des cons\u00e9quences des interpr\u00e9tations propos\u00e9es, des pr\u00e9somptions et des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales d'interpr\u00e9tation, ainsi que des sources acceptables d'aide ext\u00e9rieure. Autrement dit, les cours de justice doivent tenir compte de tous les indices pertinents et acceptables du sens d'un texte l\u00e9gislatif. Cela fait, elles doivent ensuite adopter l'interpr\u00e9tation qui est appropri\u00e9e. L'interpr\u00e9tation appropri\u00e9e est celle qui peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en raison : a) de sa plausibilit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire sa conformit\u00e9 avec le texte l\u00e9gislatif, b) de son efficacit\u00e9, dans le sens o\u00f9 elle favorise la r\u00e9alisation de l'objet du texte l\u00e9gislatif, et c) de son acceptabilit\u00e9, dans le sens o\u00f9 le r\u00e9sultat est raisonnable et juste75.\n[204] De plus, la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Il y est mentionn\u00e9 que :\n[l]es lois sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es apporter une r\u00e9paration [...] Elles doivent par cons\u00e9quent s'interpr\u00e9ter de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9quitable et la plus large qui soit pour garantir la r\u00e9alisation de leur objet selon leurs sens, intention et esprits v\u00e9ritables76.\n[205] Compte tenu de ces principes d'interpr\u00e9tation, le Tribunal conclut que les observations de la Commission concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi repr\u00e9sentent la meilleure approche quant \u00e0 cet article. Le Tribunal a lu l'article dans le contexte de la Loi. De plus, il a examin\u00e9 les interpr\u00e9tations de l'article 11 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le pass\u00e9 par les tribunaux et les cours de justice. Le Tribunal est saisi d'une preuve d'expert qui traitait de l'\u00e9volution historique du concept de parit\u00e9 salariale . Cette preuve, conjugu\u00e9e avec les commentaires formul\u00e9s par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 Ron Basford au cours des discussions qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la promulgation de la Loi, renforce, de l'avis du Tribunal, la conclusion que l'article 11 de la Loi vise \u00e0 traiter de la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[206] Le Tribunal accepte que cette interpr\u00e9tation est compatible avec l'objet de la loi, son contexte et son historique l\u00e9gislatif. L'objet de la Loi est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2 qui est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[207] L'argument de Postes Canada que cet objet souligne la port\u00e9e de la Loi en tant que loi qui ne vise uniquement que la discrimination exerc\u00e9e contre des personnes pour des motifs pr\u00e9cis ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9. Le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il s'agit d'une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de la loi, laquelle vise clairement \u00e0 traiter de la vaste question de la discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes les personnes. Les lois du Parlement doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9quitable et la plus large possible, et ce, afin d'\u00eatre \u00e9quitable envers tous. L'\u00e9limination de groupes compos\u00e9s d'hommes et de femmes de la protection de la Loi entra\u00eenerait un r\u00e9tr\u00e9cissement de l'objet de la Loi. Le Tribunal rejette cette interpr\u00e9tation et accepte que l'article 11 de la Loi, en traitant de la discrimination dans le domaine de la parit\u00e9 salariale , est conforme \u00e0 l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Loi.\n[208] L'une des observations de Postes Canada \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un continuum historique de la loi. Ce continuum comprend d'autres lois li\u00e9es au travail, comme par exemple le Code canadien du travail, qui traitent de l'important probl\u00e8me de la diff\u00e9rence entre les salaires vers\u00e9s aux femmes et les salaires vers\u00e9s aux hommes. Comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, des gouvernements successifs ont tent\u00e9, depuis le tournant du XIXe et du XXe si\u00e8cles, de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes. Du point de vue de Postes Canada, l'introduction de l'article 11 dans la Loi repr\u00e9sente la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tape d'un continuum qui a commenc\u00e9 avec la loi sur le salaire minimum puis a \u00e9volu\u00e9 vers un salaire \u00e9gal pour le m\u00eame travail effectu\u00e9 par des hommes et par des femmes, modifi\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement pour devenir un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail fondamentalement similaire et, selon leur argument, deviendrait \u00e9ventuellement tout naturellement un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale effectu\u00e9 par des hommes et par des femmes. \u00c9ventuellement, selon Postes Canada, la parit\u00e9 salariale , un concept plus loin sur le continuum et quelque peu \u00e9loign\u00e9 des quatre premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes en termes de m\u00e9thodologie et d'accent, pourrait devenir une question \u00e0 traiter \u00e0 la cinqui\u00e8me \u00e9tape. Toutefois, son principal argument, \u00e9tait que le concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale ne fait pas actuellement partie de la Loi.\n[209] Postes Canada a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que l'accent qui est mis sur les groupes professionnels, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, qui peuvent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s en utilisant diverses m\u00e9thodologies comportant des m\u00e9thodes statistiques comme des analyses de r\u00e9gression, est une caract\u00e9ristique l\u00e9gitime d'une \u00e9tude en mati\u00e8re de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Elle a toutefois pr\u00e9tendu que l'article 11 de la Loi n'avait pas trait \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[210] La Loi sur la parit\u00e9 salariale est, selon Postes Canada, quelque chose de tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent d'une d\u00e9nonciation d'une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre hommes et femmes qui exercent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Alors que Postes Canada convient que la parit\u00e9 salariale met l'accent sur le probl\u00e8me du cloisonnement professionnel des femmes et du probl\u00e8me connexe de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes, elle croit que cette interpr\u00e9tation repr\u00e9sente un bond dans la pens\u00e9e conceptuelle de ce qu'elle pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre le libell\u00e9 clair de l'article 11. \u00c0 ce titre, Postes Canada suppose que la parit\u00e9 salariale ne peut pas \u00eatre ce que le l\u00e9gislateur visait \u00e0 r\u00e9gler lorsqu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[211] Le Tribunal rejette cet argument que la parit\u00e9 salariale , en tant que concept, est au-del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e de la Loi. Le concept a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le fondement d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi. Dans l'une des premi\u00e8res causes \u00e0 discuter de l'article 11, Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[c'est l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale qui est en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce [...] l'appelante, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'agent n\u00e9gociateur des employ\u00e9s en cause, a soutenu que l'employeur intim\u00e9 ne versait pas \u00e0 certaines employ\u00e9es de sexe f\u00e9minin une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle vers\u00e9e \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin qui accomplissaient un travail \u00e9quivalent [...] en violation des articles 7 et 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne]77.\n[212] Par cons\u00e9quent, d\u00e8s le tout d\u00e9but du jugement dans cette cause, le juge Hugessen a d\u00e9crit l'article 11 de la Loi d'article comme \u00e9tant un article qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 express\u00e9ment pour traiter du probl\u00e8me de la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[213] Il a cit\u00e9 un long passage des motifs du juge en chef qui dans la cause type Action Travail des femmes c. Compagnie des chemins de fer du Canada a parl\u00e9 au nom de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada78. Dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge en chef Dickson a cit\u00e9 le rapport Abella et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que :\nla discrimination syst\u00e9mique en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, c'est la discrimination qui r\u00e9sulte simplement de l'application des m\u00e9thodes \u00e9tablies de recrutement, d'embauche et de promotion, dont ni l'une ni l'autre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement con\u00e7ue pour promouvoir la discrimination. La discrimination est alors renforc\u00e9e par l'exclusion m\u00eame du groupe d\u00e9savantag\u00e9, du fait que l'exclusion favorise la conviction, tant \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur qu'\u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du groupe, qu'elle r\u00e9sulte de forces naturelles, par exemple que les femmes ne peuvent tout simplement pas faire le travail. [...] \u00c0 cela s'ajoutent les attitudes des administrateurs et des coll\u00e8gues de travail qui acceptent une vision st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e des comp\u00e9tences et du r\u00f4le appropri\u00e9 du groupe touch\u00e9, laquelle vision conduit \u00e0 la conviction ferme que les membres de ce groupe sont incapables de faire un certain travail, m\u00eame si cette conclusion est objectivement fausse79 (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original).\n[214] Le juge Hugessen a ensuite renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c. Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor o\u00f9 le concept de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant :\nax\u00e9 sur les formes de discrimination les plus subtiles [...] et fond\u00e9 sur la reconnaissance du fait que les moeurs sociales et culturelles de longue date transmettent des pr\u00e9somptions de valeur qui contribuent \u00e0 cr\u00e9er de la discrimination sous des formes totalement ou presque enti\u00e8rement voil\u00e9es et inconscientes. Ainsi, la tendance traditionnelle \u00e0 sous-\u00e9valuer le travail des femmes peut \u00eatre perp\u00e9tu\u00e9e par des pr\u00e9somptions selon lesquelles certains types de t\u00e2ches habituellement confi\u00e9es dans le pass\u00e9 aux femmes ont naturellement moins de valeur que certains types de t\u00e2ches traditionnellement accomplies par les hommes 80.\n[215] Manifestement, le langage utilis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est le langage de la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[216] \u00c0 partir de cette position, le juge Hugessen a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 15 : On peut en effet soutenir que le type de discrimination que la parit\u00e9 salariale vise \u00e0 contrer est toujours syst\u00e9mique . Il poursuit en citant Nan Weiner et Morley Gunderson, Pay Equity Issues : Options and Experiences, Toronto, Butterworths, 1990 :\n[Traduction]\n[...] Peu importe la terminologie utilis\u00e9e, la parit\u00e9 salariale est con\u00e7ue pour corriger une forme de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. La discrimination syst\u00e9mique est fond\u00e9e sur les pratiques d'emploi. C'est un sous-produit involontaire de pratiques et politiques en apparence neutres. Toutefois, ces pratiques et politiques peuvent tr\u00e8s bien avoir un impact d\u00e9favorable ou diff\u00e9rent sur un groupe par rapport \u00e0 un autre (p. ex., sur les femmes par rapport aux hommes). Elle se distingue de la discrimination interpersonnelle o\u00f9 une personne agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers autre. [...]La parit\u00e9 salariale exige des changements dans les syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 garantir que les postes occup\u00e9s par des femmes ne seront pas sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s. (Non-soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[217] L\u00e0 encore, le juge Hugessen a soulign\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que l'article 11 de la Loi traite du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Il a clairement mentionn\u00e9, en citant Weiner et Gunderson, que ce concept traitent des emplois occup\u00e9s par des femmes, lesquels emplois, historiquement, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s. Cette situation doit \u00eatre corrig\u00e9e si l'on veut rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette situation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Ce sont les emplois qui sont de premi\u00e8re importance et non pas le sexe des titulaires.\n[218] Ce point, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la cr\u00e9ation d'une loi sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires au Canada avait pour fondement la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il fallait s'occuper du cloisonnement professionnel et de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes, a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte par le professeur Pat Armstrong qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 comme expert en mati\u00e8re de travail des femmes, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des femmes et des aspects sociologiques des lois sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires. Elle a insist\u00e9 sur la fait que, historiquement, au Canada, on a pratiqu\u00e9 le cloisonnement professionnel, c'est-\u00e0-dire que les emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9s en deux cat\u00e9gories, les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine.\n[219] Mme Armstrong a soulign\u00e9 que l'une des r\u00e9ponses du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral suite au rapport de la Commission royale d'enqu\u00eate sur la situation de la femme au Canada (1970) a \u00e9t\u00e9 la promulgation en 1978 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, notamment de l'article 11 de la Loi, afin de s'occuper de la question de la disparit\u00e9 salariale syst\u00e9mique occasionn\u00e9e par le cloisonnement professionnel. Ce contexte historique doit donc \u00eatre pris en compte lorsque l'on interpr\u00e8te l'article 11 de la Loi. L'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article doit comprendre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s'occuper de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes tel qu'on le constate dans le cloisonnement de ce travail en groupes professionnels domin\u00e9s par des femmes.\n[220] Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que l'article 11 de la Loi concerne la parit\u00e9 salariale et, \u00e0 ce titre, doit traiter des classes d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine afin de traiter du cloisonnement professionnel vis\u00e9 par ce concept. En plus de traiter d'emplois et de sexe, le concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale doit discuter de ces questions \u00e0 travers le prisme du cloisonnement professionnel.\n[221] Ce t\u00e9moignage d'expert fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration qu'a fait l'honorable Ron Basford, ministre de la Justice, durant les d\u00e9bats parlementaires de 1977 qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'adoption de la Loi. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 aux paragraphes [53] et [54] de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'honorable Ron Basford avait anticip\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes avec le concept de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale tel qu'il est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi. Il a toutefois soulign\u00e9 que l'approche du gouvernement \u00e9tait d'int\u00e9grer le principe \u00e0 la loi et de confier \u00e0 la Commission la t\u00e2che de r\u00e9gler tout probl\u00e8me rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 la mise en uvre de ce principe. Il a poursuivi en mentionnant que le probl\u00e8me sous-jacent \u00e9tait le cloisonnement professionnel des femmes et leurs r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations historiquement inf\u00e9rieures occasionn\u00e9es par une sous-\u00e9valuation de leur travail.\n[222] Compte tenu de ce contexte, ainsi que du t\u00e9moignage d'expert, le Tribunal accepte que l'article 11 de la Loi traite du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale qui se traduit en salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale entre les hommes et les femmes.\n[223] Le principe de la parit\u00e9 salariale entre le travail des hommes et le travail des femmes qui ont une valeur \u00e9gale appelle une m\u00e9thodologie qui a \u00e9volu\u00e9 avec le concept. L'article 11 est silencieux sur la m\u00e9thodologie \u00e0 utiliser pour traiter le concept. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a soulign\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision de juin 2003, la t\u00e2che d'expliquer le fonctionnement de l'article 11 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission. La promulgation de l'OPS de 1986 est le r\u00e9sultat direct de la t\u00e2che qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 cet organisme.\n[224] Chacun des articles de l'ordonnance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par Postes Canada, en fonction de son interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi, traite du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale . En effet, Postes Canada a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans ses observations concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi que l'ordonnance serait coh\u00e9rente et logique si on traitait de la parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 l'article 11. Sa position \u00e9tait que l'article 11 ne traite pas de la notion de la parit\u00e9 salariale et doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 en utilisant une m\u00e9thode simple qui repose sur le sens ordinaire des mots.\n[225] Le Tribunal conclut que l'article 11 a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 afin de traiter du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Le libell\u00e9 permet de conclure \u00e0 la vraisemblance de cette interpr\u00e9tation car les commentateurs ont pratiquement utilis\u00e9 les expressions un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale , valeur comparable et parit\u00e9 salariale les unes pour les autres. Cette interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 est efficace car elle favorise la r\u00e9alisation de l'objet du texte l\u00e9gislatif tel qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le ministre de la Justice imm\u00e9diatement avant l'adoption de la Loi ainsi que l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article 2 de la Loi, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Compte tenu de la conclusion que cette interpr\u00e9tation est plausible et efficace, elle est accept\u00e9e comme une interpr\u00e9tation juste et raisonnable qui traite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de l'objet de la Loi \u00e0 la fois dans l'article lui-m\u00eame et \u00e0 la fois dans le contexte de l'\u00e9conomie de la Loi.\n[226] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la parit\u00e9 salariale a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e comme principe d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi, lequel traite de la sous-\u00e9valuation des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes dans des groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Donc, l'examen des cat\u00e9gories d'emplois des hommes et des femmes devient un aspect important de toute \u00e9tude portant sur la parit\u00e9 salariale et l'Ordonnance de 1986 prise par la Commission, particuli\u00e8rement les articles qui sont contest\u00e9es par Postes Canada, permettent de rendre cela possible.\n[227] Le crit\u00e8re qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 par le Tribunal afin de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 des articles de l'ordonnance contest\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce par Postes Canada consiste \u00e0 savoir si elle est compatible avec le sens de l'article 11 de la Loi. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle n'est pas compatible avec l'article 11.\n[228] Le Tribunal r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu'une interpr\u00e9tation correcte de l'article 11 reconna\u00eet que l'article a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour traiter du concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale , tel que d\u00e9crit ci-dessus. La Commission s'est vu confier, en vertu de la Loi, la mise en uvre du concept et s'est vu demander de le rendre fonctionnel en prenant certaines ordonnances.\n[229] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que les contest\u00e9s articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986, en fournissant des indications quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi, lequel est fond\u00e9 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale , ont une influence d\u00e9terminante quant \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation. Ils fournissent \u00e9galement une coh\u00e9sion ainsi qu'une compl\u00e9tude \u00e0 la loi. Ils sont compatibles avec la signification de l'article 11 de la Loi et sont, de ce fait, valides et fonctionnels.\n[230] De plus, le paragraphe 8(2) de l'OPS de 1986 traite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la m\u00e9thodologie qui doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 un aspect particulier du facteur des conditions de travail \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 11(2) de la Loi. \u00c0 ce titre, il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire au d\u00e9veloppement des principes de la Loi et est compatible avec le sens de l'article 11.\n[231] En tirant ces conclusions, le Tribunal s'est pench\u00e9 sur les observations de Postes Canada ainsi que sur celles de la Commission quant \u00e0 la meilleure fa\u00e7on de v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 de la mesure l\u00e9gislative subordonn\u00e9e. En effet, le Tribunal a souscrit \u00e0 l'approche qui veut que l'on interpr\u00e8te la loi habilitante, puis, que l'on d\u00e9termine en fonction de cette interpr\u00e9tation si la mesure l\u00e9gislative contest\u00e9e est compatible avec sa loi habilitante.\n[232] Enfin, le Tribunal estime qu'il est pertinent de renvoyer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable juge Evans dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, dans laquelle il a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit concernant la validit\u00e9 d'une ordonnance contest\u00e9e :\nCompte tenu de la port\u00e9e du libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 27(2) et des attributs de l'organisme auquel le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, une disposition d'une ordonnance ne sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme invalide que si elle est clairement incompatible avec les termes dans lesquels le pouvoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s en fonction des objectifs de la Loi81 [...]\n[233] Pour reprendre les propos tenus par Me. le juge Evans, le Tribunal conclut que le paragraphe 8(2) et les articles 11 \u00e0 15 de l'OPS de 1986, contest\u00e9s par Postes Canada ne sont pas incompatibles avec leur loi habilitante lorsqu'ils sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'objet de la Loi. En effet, l'ordonnance contest\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire au bon fonctionnement de la Loi et est jug\u00e9e valide.\nC. La preuve par pr\u00e9somption [234] La question \u00e0 trancher consiste \u00e0 savoir si la preuve par pr\u00e9somption mentionn\u00e9e par le juge Evans dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, est une pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9futable. Toutes les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont convenu qu'une pr\u00e9somption, de par sa nature m\u00eame de pr\u00e9somption, peut \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e. La v\u00e9ritable question consiste \u00e0 savoir ce qui constitue une r\u00e9futation acceptable dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente plainte? Cette pr\u00e9somption peut-elle par exemple \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e par des facteurs raisonnables autre que ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans l'OPS?\n[235] Le juge Evans a soulign\u00e9 que la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes imputable aux facteurs raisonnables pr\u00e9vus, autre que le sexe, sont exclus de la port\u00e9e de l'article 11 de la Loi. Il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, d\u00e8s que l'auteur de la plainte a prouv\u00e9 qu'il existe une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, il est \u00e9tabli que cette disparit\u00e9 contrevient \u00e0 l'article 11, sous r\u00e9serve uniquement de la preuve faite par l'employeur que cette disparit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur un facteur reconnu comme raisonnable par l'article 16 de l'ordonnance82.\n[236] Le juge Evans a conclu ce qui suit :\n\u00ab On peut donc croire que le paragraphe 11(1) a rem\u00e9di\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de la preuve en \u00e9dictant une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle, lorsque les femmes et les hommes re\u00e7oivent un salaire diff\u00e9rent pour ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, cet \u00e9cart est fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, \u00e0 moins qu'il puisse \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un facteur que la Commission a reconnu comme motif raisonnable dans une ordonnance \u00bb.\n[237] De plus, le juge Evans a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[...] Troisi\u00e8mement, en raison de la nature de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, il est souvent difficile de prouver que la situation d\u00e9favorable dans laquelle se trouvent de nombreux membres de groupes particuliers dans leur milieu de travail est fond\u00e9e sur les caract\u00e9ristiques reli\u00e9es aux groupes auxquels ils appartiennent. Pour reprendre les propos tenus par le juge en chef Dickson [...] la discrimination syst\u00e9mique r\u00e9sulte simplement de l'application des m\u00e9thodes \u00e9tablies de recrutement, d'embauche et de promotion, dont ni l'une ni l'autre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement con\u00e7ue pour promouvoir la discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, les politiques et les pratiques salariales d'un employeur peuvent \u00eatre fond\u00e9es sur des pr\u00e9misses et des normes sociales tellement profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9es, quant B la valeur des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par les femmes, qu'il serait extr\u00eamement difficile d'\u00e9tablir dans un contexte judiciaire que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, c'est en raison de leur sexe que les femmes re\u00e7oivent un salaire inf\u00e9rieur aux hommes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes83.\n[238] La Commission et l'Alliance ont pr\u00e9tendu dans leurs observations que la seule fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9futer la preuve par pr\u00e9somption mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment est de se fier \u00e0 l'un des facteurs raisonnables mentionn\u00e9 dans l'OPS.\n[239] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que, bien que se fier \u00e0 un facteur raisonnable de l'OPS est certainement une fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption, cette solution n'est pas la seule.\n[240] Postes Canada a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il serait incompatible avec l'objet de la Loi de permettre que seule la Commission puisse r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption du paragraphe 11(1) au moyen des facteurs raisonnables qui y sont mentionn\u00e9s. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que l'objet de la Loi vise \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de la discrimination pour divers motifs et l'article 11 ne comprend pas tous ces motifs. Il ne vise uniquement que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[241] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon Postes Canada, l'intim\u00e9 ou l'employeur devrait \u00eatre capable de pr\u00e9senter une preuve pour montrer que le motif justifiant une disparit\u00e9 salariale, bien qu'il ne soit pas un facteur raisonnable , puisse \u00eatre d\u00fb \u00e0 une raison autre que le sexe. En d'autres mots, la liste de facteurs raisonnables ne peut pas \u00eatre ferm\u00e9e mais doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre ouverte, offrant ainsi un moyen de d\u00e9fense additionnel de r\u00e9futation de la pr\u00e9somption.\n[242] Alors que la preuve doit \u00eatre convaincante et que le fardeau de la preuve doit reposer clairement sur les \u00e9paules de l'intim\u00e9 ou de l'employeur, il devrait avoir, selon Postes Canada, la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption en pr\u00e9sentant une telle preuve.\n[243] Essentiellement, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que si l'employeur ou l'intim\u00e9 a soumis une preuve au Tribunal qui a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la disparit\u00e9 salariale n'\u00e9tait pas occasionn\u00e9e par la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, alors cela constituerait une r\u00e9futation de la pr\u00e9somption. Selon Postes Canada, le juge Evans n'a pas exclu cet argument.\n[244] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que le juge Evans a affirm\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement ce qui constitue une pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9futable en vertu du paragraphe 11(1), notamment, que la seule preuve de la pr\u00e9sence de facteurs raisonnables d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l'article 16 de l'OPS de 1986 peut r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption que, une fois qu'une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent les m\u00eames fonctions a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif du sexe est \u00e9galement \u00e9tablie.\n[245] En outre, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 48 de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada le 26 juin 2003 dans l`affaire Bell Canada (Supra note 39). Cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence renvoie au r\u00f4le de la Commission lorsqu'elle prend des ordonnances qui portent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur les facteurs raisonnables mentionn\u00e9s aux paragraphes 11(4) et 27(2) de la Loi pour justifier la disparit\u00e9 salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Ce paragraphe est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nCette disposition pr\u00e9voit clairement que des ordonnances peuvent pr\u00e9ciser la Loi, sans primer de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit sur la Loi elle-m\u00eame.\n[246] Selon la Commission, une liste ouverte de facteurs raisonnables ne permettrait pas de favoriser l'objectif qui consiste \u00e0 ajouter des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la Loi. Elle ne favoriserait pas non plus le principe qui consiste \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter d'une fa\u00e7on limitative les d\u00e9fenses dans les causes de droits de la personne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[247] Enfin, il est utile d'examiner le t\u00e9moignage de l'experte qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la Commission, le professeur Pat Armstrong, concernant la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en tant que concept. Le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu de la fa\u00e7on suivante, en contre-interrogatoire, \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par l'avocat de Postes Canada concernant la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne en Ontario :\n[Traduction]\nLa discrimination syst\u00e9mique est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e [...] la discrimination syst\u00e9mique renvoie \u00e0 la discrimination qui est occasionn\u00e9 par un ensemble de facteurs, non pas par un seul facteur, comme un seul employeur qui se conduit de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e. Le principe de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale est fond\u00e9 sur un certain genre de discrimination. C'est ce qui est reconnu comme discrimination syst\u00e9mique, c'est pourquoi la culpabilit\u00e9 n'est pas la question, ou, comme Morley Gunderson l'affirme dans son travail pour la Commission Abella, pourquoi ce n'est m\u00eame pas une question de chercher les causes profondes. C'est une question de tenter de rendre plus \u00e9gale les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des fonctions \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des fonctions \u00e0\npr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Donc, ce n'est pas une question de discrimination au sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais une question de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au sens de particulier84.\n[248] Le Tribunal accepte que l'article 11 de la Loi traite principalement d'une pratique discriminatoire particuli\u00e8re mieux connue sous le nom de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Ce type de discrimination a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9, historiquement, la cons\u00e9quence de politiques et de pratiques de recrutement et d'embauche qui intrins\u00e8quement, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement intentionnellement, ont eu pour cons\u00e9quence que les femmes \u00e9taient moins r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es que les hommes pour des fonctions comparables. Le concept de un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale est, par cons\u00e9quent, une tentative de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en mesurant la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9 par des hommes et des femmes.\n[249] Le Tribunal souligne que le juge Evans a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 19 octobre 1999 dans Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor que le paragraphe 11(1) \u00e9dicte effectivement une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle :\n\u00ab lorsque les femmes et les hommes re\u00e7oivent un salaire diff\u00e9rent pour ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, cet \u00e9cart est fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, \u00e0 moins qu'il puisse \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un facteur que la Commission a reconnu comme motif raisonnable dans une ordonnance85 \u00bb.\n[250] Le Tribunal souligne \u00e9galement que, alors que l'ensemble des parties ont convenu qu'une pr\u00e9somption, par d\u00e9finition, est r\u00e9futable, il n'y a aucune unanimit\u00e9 sur ce qui constitue une r\u00e9futation acceptable dans les circonstances de la plainte.\n[251] Le juge Evans pr\u00e9cise clairement que la pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 11(1) peut \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e par des facteurs raisonnables \u00e9tablis par la Commission en vertu des paragraphes 11(4) et 27(2) de la Loi. Par contre, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que la r\u00e9futation ne devrait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux facteurs raisonnables mentionn\u00e9s dans l'ordonnance, mais devrait \u00eatre ouverte .\n[252] Le Tribunal souligne que la d\u00e9cision susmentionn\u00e9e de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada appuie le point de vue que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait d'ajouter des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la Loi en termes du pouvoir de prendre des ordonnances qui, de l'avis du Tribunal, sont compatibles avec une approche ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de facteurs raisonnables . En outre, une liste ferm\u00e9e de facteurs raisonnables serait, de l'avis du Tribunal, \u00e9galement compatible avec le principe d'interpr\u00e9tation limitative des d\u00e9fenses dans les causes de droits de la personne.\n[253] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9dict\u00e9e par le paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi, bien qu'elle soit r\u00e9futable, en est une qui ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e que par des facteurs raisonnables reconnus, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, par la Commission, conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 11(4) et 27(2) de la Loi.\nV. LA PREUVE PRIMA FACIE A. Contexte et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'une preuve prima facie quant \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi [254] En raison de la nature syst\u00e9mique de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, la plainte est trait\u00e9e en utilisant la Loi actuelle, telle que modifi\u00e9e en 1998. Cela ressort de la discussion sur la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 et la validit\u00e9 de l'OPS de 1986 soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section IV, B de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit examiner chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'article 11, dans son libell\u00e9 actuel. Chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'article 11 de la Loi doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, afin de justifier la plainte.\n[255] L'article 11 interdit la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans la fixation des salaires. Le paragraphe 11(1) mentionne que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Le paragraphe 11(2) mentionne le crit\u00e8re permettant d'\u00e9tablir l'\u00e9quivalence des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es. La valeur attribu\u00e9e aux fonctions doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le dosage de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaire pour leur ex\u00e9cution, compte tenu des conditions de travail. De plus, le paragraphe 11(4) permet aux employeurs d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 toute conclusion de discrimination, et ce, dans des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales qui sont appel\u00e9es facteurs raisonnables .\n[256] Comme il est soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section IV, C de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'article 11 comprend une pr\u00e9somption int\u00e9gr\u00e9e de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, l'un des facteurs de discrimination interdit mentionn\u00e9 dans la Loi, lorsque l'on a conclu qu'il existe une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Cette pr\u00e9somption est assujettie \u00e0 la contrainte des facteurs raisonnables pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au paragraphe 11(4) et dont la d\u00e9finition est \u00e9toff\u00e9e par l'OPS.\n[257] Comme il est soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section IV, B de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'OPS de 1986 est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 toute discussion de l'article 11 de la Loi, car elle \u00e9claire le principe de la parit\u00e9 salariale qui est le fondement de l'article. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque l'on traite de l'article 11 dans le contexte de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi, chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments figurent \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi et dans les directives qui sont offertes concernant les pr\u00e9cisions de l'article dans les ordonnances prises par la Commission en vertu du mandat qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 27 de la Loi :\nLe groupe professionnel plaignant est compos\u00e9 majoritairement de membres appartenant au m\u00eame sexe et le groupe professionnel de comparaison est compos\u00e9 majoritairement de membres de l'autre sexe. Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, cela signifie que le groupe des CR plaignants doit \u00eatre \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et le groupe de comparaison PO doit \u00eatre \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Le groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et le groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine qui sont compar\u00e9s sont compos\u00e9s d'employ\u00e9s qui travaillent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement. La valeur du travail compar\u00e9 entre les deux groupes professionnels a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on fiable sur le fondement du dosage de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaire pour leur ex\u00e9cution, compte tenu des conditions de travail. L'\u00e9valuation qui s'ensuit \u00e9tablit que le travail compar\u00e9 est de valeur \u00e9gale. Une comparaison faite entre les salaires vers\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s des deux groupes professionnels pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes d\u00e9montre qu'il existe une diff\u00e9rence entre les salaires vers\u00e9s entre les deux groupes, le groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine qui est moins bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 que le groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Cette disparit\u00e9 salariale est commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9e \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration .\nB. Le groupe plaignant et le groupe de comparaison repr\u00e9sentent-ils, respectivement, un groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et un groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, permettant de comparer les fonctions, en vertu de la Loi? [258] L'histoire des groupes connus sous les noms de CR et de PO commence lorsque le syst\u00e8me de classification du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dans les ann\u00e9es 60. Encore aujourd'hui, ce syst\u00e8me existe toujours dans l'ensemble, dans la sph\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Au sein du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le minist\u00e8re des Postes a \u00e9t\u00e9 le pr\u00e9curseur de Postes Canada, laquelle est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat. Lorsque, par la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat Postes Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1981, les normes de classification du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ainsi que les \u00e9chelles de salaire attribu\u00e9es aux niveaux de classification du gouvernement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9es pour les employ\u00e9s du gouvernement qui sont devenus employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli en conformit\u00e9 avec les r\u00e8gles de transition pr\u00e9vues dans la loi qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 Postes Canada en tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat.\n[259] La pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Commission par le groupe professionnel CR employ\u00e9 par la toute nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat, Postes Canada. Le Groupe CR s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans la plainte comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine . Le groupe \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de travailleurs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s comme Commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements lorsqu'ils travaillaient au minist\u00e8re des Postes. Cette classification du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e par l'ensemble des travailleurs Commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements employ\u00e9s dans l'ensemble du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Lorsque les CR dans la plainte sont devenus des employ\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat, Postes Canada, leur classification CR a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e. Il y a toutefois eu une promesse entre l'Alliance, le syndicat repr\u00e9sentant les CR et certains autres groupes occupationnels et Postes Canada qu'il y aurait \u00e9ventuellement des n\u00e9gociations visant \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer les postes CR ainsi que d'autres postes. Cette promesse \u00e9tait le fondement du travail que la direction de Postes Canada et l'Alliance ont entrepris lorsqu'ils ont tent\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation System One .\n[260] Le groupe plaignant a choisi, comme groupe de comparaison pour la plainte, le Groupe des op\u00e9rations postales (les PO), lequel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Les PO \u00e9taient, tout comme les CR, des employ\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral lorsque le Bureau de poste \u00e9tait un minist\u00e8re gouvernemental et ils ont conserv\u00e9 leur statut de PO lorsqu'ils sont devenus employ\u00e9s de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat. Ces employ\u00e9s, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Syndicat des travailleurs et des travailleuses des postes (STTP), avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine des membres d'un groupe f\u00e9d\u00e9ral unique appel\u00e9 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la manutention du courrier .\n[261] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 aux paragraphes [25] et [26] ci-dessus, au 24 janvier 1992, la date du rapport finale d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, avec sa recommandation que la plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, il y avait 2 310 postes de CR, divis\u00e9s en niveaux CR-2 (260 postes), CR-3 (950 postes), CR-4 (950 postes) et CR-5 (150 postes). Il y avait 43 099 postes PO, divis\u00e9s en postes PO-INT (quatre niveaux), postes PO-EXT (trois niveaux) et postes PO-SUP (six niveaux). Bien que la v\u00e9ritable date de prise d'effet de ces chiffres n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans le rapport final de la Commission, il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'ils repr\u00e9sentent les populations des deux groupes en date du rapport final ou \u00e0 cette date pr\u00e8s.\n[262] Dans l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, 1983, le nombre de postes CR \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame (2 316) qu'au d\u00e9but de 1992, alors que le nombre de postes PO \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'environ 8 000 postes (50 912).\n[263] L'article 11 de la Loi traite des fonctions et des salaires dans le contexte de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Historiquement, on a tent\u00e9, par la parit\u00e9 salariale , de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me du cloisonnement professionnel fond\u00e9 sur le sexe et des salaires qui d\u00e9coulent de ce cloisonnement. Traditionnellement, les salaires vers\u00e9s pour les fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux vers\u00e9s pour des fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes. Comme l'article 11 ne pr\u00e9voit aucune d\u00e9finition pour ce qui constitue un groupe professionnel compos\u00e9 majoritairement de membres d'un m\u00eame sexe, le Tribunal doit chercher des \u00e9claircissements dans les articles 12 et 13 de l'OPS de 1986. La Commission a utilis\u00e9 les pouvoirs qui lui sont accord\u00e9s par l'article 27 de la Loi de produire cette ordonnance pratique pour les plaintes collectives. Les articles 12 et 13 de l'OPS de 1986 permettent une comparaison entre les groupes professionnels tant et aussi longtemps que ces groupements repr\u00e9sentent des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es surtout par des hommes et surtout par des femmes.\n[264] L'article 13 de l'OPS de 1986 mentionne de nombreuses formules servant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si un groupe professionnel est compos\u00e9 majoritairement de membres d'un sexe. Par exemple, un groupe professionnel qui compte plus de 500 membres est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00eatre compos\u00e9 majoritairement des membres d'un sexe si au moins 55 p. 100 de ses membres appartiennent \u00e0 ce sexe. Dans la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi, chaque groupe, dans l'ensemble, \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de plus de 500 membres lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[265] Le groupe plaignant a fait savoir \u00e0 la Commission, et a exprim\u00e9 cet avis dans le libell\u00e9 de la plainte elle-m\u00eame, qu'il \u00e9tait un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Le groupe choisi comme groupe de comparaison a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le plaignant comme \u00e9tant un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. En 1983, plus de 80 p. 100 du Groupe CR \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin et un peu plus de 75 p. 100 du Groupe PO \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin86. Au moment du renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal en 1992, le Groupe CR \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine dans une proportion de plus de 83 p. 100 et le Groupe PO (qui n'\u00e9tait alors compos\u00e9 que des sous-groupes PO-INT et PO-EXT, le sous-groupe PO-SUP ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 par la Commission durant son enqu\u00eate) \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine dans une proportion d'un peu plus de 71 p. 10087.\n[266] L'Alliance et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent que ces pourcentages suffisent pour classer le groupe plaignant comme \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et le groupe de comparaison comme \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine.\n[267] Les observations de l'Alliance et de la Commission concernant la pr\u00e9dominance d'un sexe ou de l'autre dans les deux groupes sont fond\u00e9es sur leur interpr\u00e9tation de l'OPS de 1986. De plus, ils pr\u00e9tendent que, selon la Loi, l'OPS, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit jug\u00e9e ultra vires (ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce), lie le Tribunal.\n[268] L'Alliance et la Commission pr\u00e9tendent que selon l'OPS de 1986 lorsqu'un groupe professionnel compte plus de 500 membres, seulement 55 p. 100 des personnes dans le groupe n'ont qu'\u00e0 appartenir \u00e0 un sexe ou l'autre pour pr\u00e9sumer que ce groupe ex\u00e9cute des fonctions de personnes appartenant \u00e0 ce sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les groupes sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes (les CR) ou des fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes (les PO) en raison du fait qu'ils sont des groupes qui comptent plus de 500 membres au total et que le pourcentage de membres de sexe f\u00e9minin ou de membres de sexe masculin de chaque groupe rend ses fonctions repr\u00e9sentatives soit des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes, soit des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes. L'argument est qu'il s'agit d'un simple calcul arithm\u00e9tique qui, une fois effectu\u00e9, est l'un des facteurs dont on se sert pour choisir un groupe plaignant et un groupe de comparaison. Toutefois, c'est le facteur qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'article 11 (clarifi\u00e9 par l'OPS) qui exige que, lorsque l'on traite avec une plainte collective, le groupe plaignant est un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et le groupe de comparaison est un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine.\n[269] Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que les pourcentages sont illusoires. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le Groupe PO ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un groupe fusionn\u00e9. Selon Postes Canada, le groupe PO est, et a traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9, un groupe qui aspire au principe de la ligne de salaire rectiligne . L'argument de Postes Canada insiste sur le fait que, au cours de l'histoire de la plainte, le niveau PO-4 a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus important du sous-groupe PO-INT. Selon Postes Canada, c'est le niveau PO-4 qui est le plus repr\u00e9sentatif du Groupe PO dans son ensemble et la cat\u00e9gorie de classification o\u00f9 l'on retrouve le plus grand nombre de postes PO. En effet, Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que le niveau PO-4 du Groupe PO a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 essentiellement neutre quant \u00e0 sa composition en femmes et en hommes et devrait \u00eatre plut\u00f4t consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant repr\u00e9sentatif du Groupe PO dans son ensemble. En 1983, 53 p. 100 des employ\u00e9s class\u00e9s au niveau PO-4 \u00e9taient des hommes et 47 p. 100 \u00e9taient des femmes. En 1992, les chiffres \u00e9taient 50,6 p. 100 hommes et 49,4 p. 100 femmes. Si le Groupe PO \u00e9tait d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant de niveau PO-4, Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que, comme groupe de comparaison, il n'est pas vis\u00e9 par la d\u00e9finition d'un groupe de comparaison \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine en vertu de l'OPS.\n[270] Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que si l'on prend le Groupe PO dans son ensemble, on se trouve \u00e0 ignorer la tendance historique voulant que le nombre d'employ\u00e9s de niveau PO-4 devient de plus en plus la cat\u00e9gorie la plus importante et la plus repr\u00e9sentative des travailleurs des Op\u00e9rations postales. En fait, les employ\u00e9s class\u00e9s au niveau PO-4 au sein du sous-groupe du Traitement du courrier interne et du service postal compl\u00e9mentaire repr\u00e9sentaient un peu plus de 83 p. 100 du total du sous-groupe en 1983 et 88 p. 100 en 1992. Par contre, comme pourcentage de l'ensemble du Groupe PO, les employ\u00e9s du niveau PO-4 repr\u00e9sentaient 41 p. 100 en 1983 et presque 42 p. 100 en 1992.\n[271] Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cet argument. Le syst\u00e8me de classification des postes du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est fond\u00e9 sur le concept de groupes d'employ\u00e9s, li\u00e9s ensemble par des cat\u00e9gories de classes de poste. Au sein de ces groupes, le concept de niveaux est li\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rences salariales. Historiquement, ces niveaux, avec leur diff\u00e9rence salariale, ont repos\u00e9 sur des facteurs comme l'anciennet\u00e9, l'opinion de la direction sur l'importance des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque niveau, la formation et les comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es. Qu'un syndicat \u00e0 Postes Canada, repr\u00e9sentant de nombreux ou l'ensemble des membres du Groupe PO puissent avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de tenter de cr\u00e9er une situation o\u00f9 les niveaux de classification n'ont essentiellement rien \u00e0 voir avec les diff\u00e9rences salariales ne peut pas changer le concept historique qui constitue le fondement des groupes et niveaux eux-m\u00eames. C'est ce concept qui est important pour la d\u00e9signation de groupe professionnel aux articles 12 et 13 de l'OPS de 1986 et pour la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[272] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accepte que le groupe professionnel plaignant, les CR, et le groupe de comparaison, les PO, sont respectivement repr\u00e9sentatifs d'un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et d'un groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine parce que chacun comprend plus de 500 membres et parce que chacun comprend au moins 55 p. 100 d'employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin (les CR plaignants) et des employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin (les PO le comparateur). Cette conclusion est fond\u00e9e sur l'OPS de 1986 qui mentionne l'importance de la taille de chaque groupe et du pourcentage n\u00e9cessaire d'hommes ou de femmes dans chaque groupe professionnel d'une certaine taille qui fera en sorte que le groupe sera pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00eatre \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine.\n[273] La Loi oblige le Tribunal \u00e0 suivre l'OPS qui traite des questions mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte dont il est saisi, une plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, qui traite de groupes professionnels.\n[274] Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend que, m\u00eame si les groupes ont une composition ad\u00e9quate quant au sexe, le choix Groupe PO comme groupe de comparaison a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'Alliance parce que ce groupe se disait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. Un tel choix, dans le contexte de la parit\u00e9 salariale , serait, selon Postes Canada, une s\u00e9lection al\u00e9atoire et, par cons\u00e9quent, non appropri\u00e9.\n[275] M. Norman Willis, un t\u00e9moin pour le compte de Postes Canada qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le Tribunal comme expert en parit\u00e9 salariale et en \u00e9valuation des emplois, \u00e9tait l'un des t\u00e9moins qui a expliqu\u00e9 le concept de s\u00e9lection al\u00e9atoire .\n[276] Il a expliqu\u00e9 que, dans le cadre d'une plainte collective en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale , le groupe plaignant choisit son groupe de comparaison. La s\u00e9lection al\u00e9atoire dans des situations de parit\u00e9 salariale pr\u00e9voit un sc\u00e9nario dans lequel le groupe plaignant choisit un groupe de comparaison qui, bien qu'il ne comprenne que peu de membres, repr\u00e9sente le groupe le mieux r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 parmi les groupes de comparaison disponibles. Bien que, naturellement, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration constitue l'un des aspects naturels du choix, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale comporte une all\u00e9gation de paiement d'une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration inf\u00e9rieure au groupe plaignant lorsqu'on le compare avec le groupe de comparateur choisi, le choix d'un groupe en fonction uniquement de sa caract\u00e9ristique de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9lev\u00e9e, si l'on compare avec le groupe plaignant, n'est pas un point de d\u00e9part acceptable pour faire une comparaison l\u00e9gitime en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Cela fausserait les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation et de la comparaison au profit du groupe plaignant. Permettre l'utilisation d'un groupe de comparaison choisi al\u00e9atoirement cr\u00e9erait un bouleversement au sein d'un \u00e9tablissement, car il y aurait in\u00e9vitablement des comparaisons ult\u00e9rieures entre le groupe plaignant originel et les autres travailleurs.\n[277] Au cours de ses explications quant au choix al\u00e9atoire , M. Willis a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi \u00e9tait vici\u00e9e d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part en raison du choix al\u00e9atoire du groupe de comparaison en fonction de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9e vers\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s du groupe PO. Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 au fait que le nombre de membres du Groupe PO n'\u00e9tait aucunement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 mais repr\u00e9sentait environ 80 p. 100 de l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada, il a convenu que ce choix aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un choix tr\u00e8s al\u00e9atoire 88\n[278] Au nom de la Commission, M. Paul Durber, directeur de la Direction de la parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 la Commission, accept\u00e9 par le Tribunal comme expert en parit\u00e9 salariale, a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le Groupe PO, dans son ensemble, a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Commission comme \u00e9tant un groupe de comparaison convenable car il faisait partie des groupements professionnels de l'employeur. Au d\u00e9but de l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission, le Groupe PO semblait \u00e9galement offrir une certaine facilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation et de comparaison en raison de la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale homog\u00e8ne des divers postes dans chacun des sous-groupes PO-INT et PO-EXT.\n[279] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Chris Jones, le repr\u00e9sentant syndical du groupe plaignant, une raison pour laquelle le groupe de comparaison a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi est la similitude entre les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s de certains postes CR et PO. L'exemple le plus patent \u00e9tait le poste CR appel\u00e9 commis au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et le poste PO appel\u00e9 commis au guichet . Bien que chaque poste semblait exiger du travail presque identique, chacun \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sup\u00e9rieure du commis au guichet et des autres postes PO a fait du Groupe PO, qui, d'apr\u00e8s les apparences, \u00e9tait \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, un choix \u00e9vident de groupe de comparaison pour le groupe plaignant. De plus, le Groupe PO repr\u00e9sentait, en nombre absolu, la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s des postes.\n[280] M. Jones a mentionn\u00e9 que bien que l'on croyait que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des CR, l'importance m\u00eame du Groupe PO a \u00e9t\u00e9 cruciale quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi. En tant que groupe d'employ\u00e9s le plus important \u00e0 Postes Canada, repr\u00e9sentant de loin la majorit\u00e9 du nombre total d'employ\u00e9s de l'employeur, les PO \u00e9taient un choix naturel de groupe de comparaison pour les CR. Le fait, \u00e9galement, qu'une certaine partie du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par les employ\u00e9s appartenant au groupe plaignant et par les employ\u00e9s appartenant au groupe de comparaison soit similaire en termes de qualifications, d'efforts, de responsabilit\u00e9s et de conditions de travail t\u00e9moignait pour la plaignante, de la pertinence de son choix de groupe de comparaison.\n[281] Le Tribunal accepte que le groupe professionnel le plus important au sein de l'organisme, un groupe repr\u00e9sentant environ 80 p. 100 de l'effectif total de Postes Canada, \u00e9tait un groupe appropri\u00e9 comme choix de groupe de comparaison. Il semblait \u00eatre un groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine selon l'OPS. La connaissance additionnelle que certains membres du Groupe PO effectuaient du travail qui, dans certains cas du moins, \u00e9taient semblable au travail effectu\u00e9 par le groupe plaignant a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la pertinence du choix.\n[282] De plus, la preuve indique que peu d'autres groupes de comparaison auraient pu \u00eatre choisis. Au moment de l'\u00e9mission de la plainte, les groupes professionnels Manuvre et hommes de m\u00e9tier et Services divers - les deux groupes \u00e9tant apparemment \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, selon l'OPS - repr\u00e9sentaient un faible pourcentage des employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. En outre, il n'existe aucune preuve que l'on ait constat\u00e9 que le travail effectu\u00e9 par les membres de ces groupes \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celui des membres du groupe CR plaignant.\n[283] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que le groupe plaignant, un groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et que le groupe de comparaison, un groupe professionnel \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi et de l'OPS de 1986 comme groupes repr\u00e9sentatifs pour la comparaison des fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des femmes et des fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par des hommes. Par cons\u00e9quent, le premier crit\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9.\nC. Les membres du groupe plaignant et ceux du groupe de comparaison travaillent-ils dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement ? [284] Le paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[285] Le paragraphe 11(3) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nLes \u00e9tablissements distincts qu'un employeur am\u00e9nage ou maintient dans le but principal de justifier une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre hommes et femmes sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent article, ne constituer qu'un seul et m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement.\n[286] L'article 10 de l'OPS de 1986 est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nEmploy\u00e9s d'un \u00e9tablissement\nPour l'application de l'article 11 de la Loi, les employ\u00e9s d'un \u00e9tablissement comprennent, ind\u00e9pendamment des conventions collectives, tous les employ\u00e9s au service de l'employeur qui sont vis\u00e9s par la m\u00eame politique en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires que celle-ci soit ou non administr\u00e9e par un service central. (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[287] La version anglaise de l'article 10 de l'OPS 1986 est libell\u00e9 comme suit :\nEmployees of an establishment\nFor the purpose of section 11 of the Act, employees of an establishment include, notwithstanding any collective agreement applicable to any employees of the establishment, all employees of the employer subject to a common personnel and wage policy, whether or not such policy is administered centrally.\n(i) \u00c9volution de la d\u00e9finition d'\u00e9tablissement [288] La Commission a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le Groupe de travail sur la parit\u00e9 salariale en novembre 1977 [Traduction] pour \u00e9tudier les r\u00e9percussions de l'application de l'article 11 de la Loi . Entre autres choses, le Groupe de travail s'est pench\u00e9 sur la question de la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement tel qu'il est utilis\u00e9 au paragraphe 11(1).\n[289] Le rapport du Groupe de travail, intitul\u00e9 R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9gale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes , dat\u00e9 de mars 1978, recommandait que \u00e9tablissement soit d\u00e9fini comme suit, puis inscrit dans une ordonnance :\nL' \u00e9tablissement d\u00e9signe tous les b\u00e2timents, les ouvrages ou autres endroits de l'entreprise d'un employeur qui se trouvent dans les limites d'une municipalit\u00e9, d'un district municipal, d'une r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine, d'un comt\u00e9 ou de la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale, selon ce qui est le plus \u00e9tendu89. (Recommandation \u00e0 \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9e)\n[290] Le Groupe de travail a soulign\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9finition \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te et avait besoin d'\u00eatre examin\u00e9e davantage. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] l'introduction du terme \u00e9tablissement dans l'article 11 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00eatre une tentative d'adoption du facteur des diff\u00e9rences r\u00e9gionales quant au niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration comme motif l\u00e9gitime de disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les employ\u00e9s 90.\n[291] M. Paul Durber a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, selon lui, la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9ographique susmentionn\u00e9e du mot \u00e9tablissement n'a probablement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e dans l'OER de 1978 parce que le Groupe de travail avait soulign\u00e9 un certain nombre d'opinions contradictoires sur la question. De plus, il a fait part de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour la Commission d'acqu\u00e9rir plus d'exp\u00e9rience dans la mise en application de l'article 11 avant d'ench\u00e2sser la d\u00e9finition dans l'OPS de 198691. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement ne figure dans l'OER de 1978.\n[292] En septembre 1984, la Commission a publi\u00e9 le Guide d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 de la Loi intitul\u00e9 \u00c0 salaire \u00e9gal, travail \u00e9gal 92. Ce Guide visait \u00e0 aider les employeurs et les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 comprendre comment la Commission \u00e9valuerait les plaintes en fournissant des d\u00e9finitions de certains termes utilis\u00e9s dans la Loi et en commentant sur les facteurs raisonnables figurant dans l'OPS de 1978.\n[293] Le guide d'interpr\u00e9tation de 1984 d\u00e9finit comme suit le mot \u00e9tablissement :\nL'\u00e9tablissement d\u00e9signe tous les b\u00e2timents, les ouvrages ou autres endroits de l'entreprise d'un employeur qui se trouvent dans les limites d'une municipalit\u00e9, d'un district municipal, d'une r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine, d'un comt\u00e9 ou de la r\u00e9gion de la capitale nationale, selon ce qui est le plus \u00e9tendu, ou toutes limites g\u00e9ographiques plus \u00e9tendues qui peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies, par l'employeur ou conjointement par l'employeur et le syndicat.\n[294] M. Durber a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9ographique du mot \u00e9tablissement fut accept\u00e9e dans le Guide d'interpr\u00e9tation de 1984, la Commission ne l'a pas appliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on constante car la Commission a souvent utilis\u00e9 une autre d\u00e9finition fond\u00e9e sur des lignes fonctionnelles, en particulier pour des causes impliquant le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et des organismes nationaux qu'elle a estim\u00e9 \u00eatre des \u00e9tablissements nationaux uniques.\n[295] Le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 mars 1985 qu'il envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 environ 60 employeurs du secteur public et du secteur priv\u00e9, notamment Postes Canada, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux-ci leur opinion quant \u00e0 un certain nombre de d\u00e9finitions et de lignes directrices envisag\u00e9es, notamment la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement . La demande visait \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre une grande partie de l'incertitude v\u00e9cue par un certain nombre d'employeurs quant \u00e0 la mise en uvre de leur propre programme de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[296] La lettre du pr\u00e9sident de la Commission mentionnait que l'on avait propos\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir d'une fa\u00e7on plus large le mot \u00e9tablissement , et ce, en utilisant un fondement diff\u00e9rent que celui utilis\u00e9 dans le Guide d'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission. La proposition pr\u00e9voyait qu'une d\u00e9finition fonctionnelle remplacerait la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9ographique pr\u00e9vue dans le Guide. La Commission a plus particuli\u00e8rement propos\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nOn consid\u00e9rerait que les travailleurs font partie du m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement lorsqu'ils sont vis\u00e9s par un ensemble commun de politiques, de r\u00e8glements et de proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et lorsque ces politiques, r\u00e8glements et proc\u00e9dures sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9s centralement m\u00eame si leur administration est d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 de plus petites unit\u00e9s organisationnelles.\n[297] Le vice-pr\u00e9sident, Personnel, de Postes Canada a r\u00e9pondu le 3 juin 1985 \u00e0 la lettre du pr\u00e9sident et a express\u00e9ment abord\u00e9 la question de la d\u00e9finition envisag\u00e9e du mot \u00e9tablissement . Il a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement envisag\u00e9e par la Commission est \u00e9galement une source d'inqui\u00e9tude. Alors que la Commission a clairement comp\u00e9tence en vertu des dispositions de l'article 22 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne de prendre des ordonnances, nous sommes d'avis que ces ordonnances doivent \u00eatre conformes \u00e0 la Loi dans son ensemble. Selon nous, d\u00e9finir le mot \u00e9tablissement d'une fa\u00e7on fonctionnelle plut\u00f4t que d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9ographique serait incompatible avec la Loi et contraire \u00e0 d'autres interpr\u00e9tations l\u00e9gislatives et judiciaires de ce mot, lesquelles parlent fr\u00e9quemment en termes de lieu plut\u00f4t que de fonction.\n[298] Des consultations tenues entre la Commission et les divers employeurs, notamment Postes Canada, ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines modifications dans les d\u00e9finitions et dans l'ordonnance envisag\u00e9es. En bout de ligne, l'OER de 1978 (telle que modifi\u00e9e en 1982) a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par l'OPS de novembre 1986 dans laquelle, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, figurait une d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement (art. 10 de l'OPS). Cette d\u00e9finition est fonctionnelle et s'inspire de celle mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe [296] susmentionn\u00e9.\n[299] En m\u00eame temps, un nouveau facteur raisonnable a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste alors existante (art. 16) des facteurs reconnus raisonnables pour justifier la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Ce facteur est le suivant : les variations salariales r\u00e9gionales, dans les cas o\u00f9 le r\u00e9gime salarial applicable aux employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9voit des variations de salaire pour un m\u00eame travail selon la r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9 le lieu de travail .\n[300] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 fin de 1986, la Commission en \u00e9tait officiellement arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une d\u00e9finition fond\u00e9e sur la fonction du mot \u00e9tablissement de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa politique ant\u00e9rieure, appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, selon laquelle elle employait une d\u00e9finition fond\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9gion. Les motifs de la Commission quant \u00e0 ce changement sont tr\u00e8s bien expliqu\u00e9s par M. Durber dans la r\u00e9ponse suivante qu'il a donn\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nQ. Pouvez-vous nous rappeler le motif qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'adoption d'une d\u00e9finition fonctionnelle?\nR. Oui. Je crois que cela avait pour but de permettre une interpr\u00e9tation et une application plus large, disons plus lib\u00e9rale, de l'article 1193.\n[301] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que durant l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte (1984-1991), l'hypoth\u00e8se que le groupe plaignant et le groupe de comparaison \u00e9taient dans un seul \u00e9tablissement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Postes Canada n'a pas soulev\u00e9 la question de la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement dans le contexte de la plainte durant cette p\u00e9riode, bien qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans des discussions avec la Commission pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur ce sujet lors de la r\u00e9daction de l'OPS de 1986.\n[302] M. Durber a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'est rappel\u00e9 que, au cours de 1991 , il avait appris de l'enqu\u00eateur sur la plainte que la personne ressource principale de Postes Canada avait mentionn\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] se demandait si la question de l'\u00e9tablissement \u00e9tait un point contest\u00e9 . Selon M. Durber, Postes Canada n'avait pas formellement mentionn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement serait d\u00e9battue dans le cadre de la contestation de la plainte de l'intim\u00e9e94.\n[303] Apr\u00e8s un long contre-interrogatoire, comprenant notamment des questions sur le travail de la Commission pour d\u00e9finir le mot \u00e9tablissement , l'avocat de la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Durber si son opinion initiale concernant la signification du mot \u00e9tablissement avait chang\u00e9. Il a r\u00e9pondu que, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte il :\n[Traduction]\n[...] avait continu\u00e9 [...] de voir qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul \u00e9tablissement, un bon nombre de caract\u00e9ristiques communes au niveau de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la gestion qui faisaient relever ces groupes d'un seul \u00e9tablissement, au sens de l'article 10 de l'Ordonnance sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, permettant ainsi de poursuivre la comparaison de la valeur des fonctions entre les commis et les personnes travaillant aux op\u00e9rations postales 95.\n[304] La Commission et l'Alliance ont reconnu que l'avocat de Postes Canada avait soulev\u00e9 des questions quant \u00e0 la signification du mot \u00e9tablissement dans le contexte de l'article 11 de la Loi et de l'article 10 de l'OPS de 1986 durant les remarques pr\u00e9liminaires qu'il avait faites devant le Tribunal, en f\u00e9vrier 1993. Il avait affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa prochaine question est celle que nous estimons comme \u00e9tant la question charni\u00e8re et il s'agit de la question de l'\u00e9tablissement [...] Donc, la loi envisage certainement diff\u00e9rents \u00e9tablissements chez le m\u00eame employeur. La grande question, laquelle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e, et pour autant que nous sachions, laquelle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue, est la suivante : Qu'est-ce qu'un \u00e9tablissement96?\n[305] L'avocat de Postes Canada a par la suite abord\u00e9 la question de l' \u00e9tablissement dans le cadre sp\u00e9cifique de l'OPS de 1986 soulignant que [Traduction] l'OER de 1978 ne comprend aucune d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement . L'OPS de 1986 pr\u00e9voit une d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement 97.\n[306] Il a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la position de Postes Canada serait la suivante :\n[Traduction]\nNotre position sera que l'autre partie doit donner une d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement qui comprend les CR, les PO-Interne, les PO-Externe et les PO-Sups \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement \u00e0 l'exclusion des autres groupes. Si la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement exclut les autres travailleurs qui travaillent dans le secteur op\u00e9rationnel chez Postes Canada, en quoi peut-elle comprendre les CR98?\n(ii) La cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes [307] L'ensemble des parties conviennent que le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 18 mars 2004 et dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement dans le contexte de l'article 11 de la Loi et de l'article 10 de l'OPS de 1986. Cette d\u00e9cision a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du tribunal et de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance) dans une plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par des agents de bord (groupe \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine) d'Air Canada et de Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien. Ils n'\u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s que par un seul syndicat. Ils ont d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme groupes de comparaison le groupe des pilotes et le groupe des travailleurs qui assurent les services de maintenance et autres services techniques (groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine). Ces groupes \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par deux autres syndicats. La question de savoir si le groupe plaignant et les groupes de comparaison travaillaient dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement est une question fondamentale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par le tribunal comme question pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[308] Le tribunal a conclu que le demandeur, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (Division du transport a\u00e9rien) a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9montrer le moindre semblant de politiques essentielles communes des salaires et du personnel s'appliquant \u00e0 l'ensemble des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation 99 et a conclu que les trois groupes d'employ\u00e9s ne travaillaient pas dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement pour les fins d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Section de premi\u00e8re instance) a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du tribunal100.\n[309] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que la d\u00e9finition fond\u00e9e sur la fonction du mot \u00e9tablissement figurant \u00e0 l'article 10 de l'OPS de 1986 situerait, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s d'un employeur dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement m\u00eame si un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents syndicats101. La Cour a conclu que le groupe plaignant et les groupes de comparaison choisis dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes travaillaient, par cons\u00e9quent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement aux fins de l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[310] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 l'importance d'interpr\u00e9ter les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de fa\u00e7on large, lib\u00e9rale et en fonction du libell\u00e9 et de l'objet de la loi pertinente. La Cour a insist\u00e9 sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9ter la Loi et l'OPS de 1986 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leur objet, tout en \u00e9tant toujours conscient de la nature quasi constitutionnelle de la Loi et de l'objet qu'elle vise, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination. La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que dans les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, l' objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'article qui est de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe 102 et l'objet plus particulier [...] la promotion de la parit\u00e9 salariale 103, doivent guider l'interpr\u00e9tation du libell\u00e9 de l'article et de l'ordonnance prise par la Commission.\n[311] La Cour a mentionn\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00e9tablissement dans le contexte de ces objets \u00e9tait qu' il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que l'employeur consid\u00e8re les groupes d'employ\u00e9s comme parties d'une entreprise unique et int\u00e9gr\u00e9e. Si tel est le cas, alors les employ\u00e9s font partie du m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement 104. Le juge Evans, dans ses motifs concourants, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [...] les employ\u00e9s du m\u00eame employeur seront en principe soumis \u00e0 la m\u00eame politique en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires s'ils travaillent au sein de la m\u00eame entit\u00e9 commerciale 105.\n[312] En d'autres mots, la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00e9tablissement pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 10 de l'OPS de 1986 a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la Cour comme exigeant la preuve de l'existence de politiques communes de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Il ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner les d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis des diff\u00e9rentes conventions collectives n\u00e9goci\u00e9es par les syndicats qui repr\u00e9sentent les groupes qui sont compar\u00e9s. La Cour a convenu que la d\u00e9finition de \u00e9tablissement ne devrait pas d\u00e9pendre des innombrables d\u00e9tails donn\u00e9s dans les conventions collectives 106.\n[313] Le juge Evans, dans ses motifs concourants, a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que [l]es termes des conventions collectives qui s'appliquent aux plaignants et autres employ\u00e9s avec lesquels les plaignants souhaitent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale sont sans rapport avec la question de savoir si les plaignants et les groupes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence font partie du m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement au sens de l'article 11 de la Loi [...] et au sens de l'article 10 de l' Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale [...] 107.\n(iii) L'incidence de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes sur la pr\u00e9sente cause [314] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 que l'ensemble des parties \u00e0 la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi ont reconnu que le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes , Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu dans ses observations \u00e9crites que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait importante pour le Tribunal parce qu'elle soulignait plusieurs des arguments d\u00e9j\u00e0 invoqu\u00e9s par Postes Canada.\n[315] Trois des arguments de Postes Canada m\u00e9ritent une attention particuli\u00e8re. Le premier argument avait trait \u00e0 la question de l'objectif essentiel vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 de la Loi et la pr\u00e9somption de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe que l'on retrouve \u00e0 cet article. Le deuxi\u00e8me argument avait trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation juste et \u00e9quitable de la valeur des salaires aux fins d'une enqu\u00eate en vertu de l'article 11. Le troisi\u00e8me argument concernait la pertinence de la force de la n\u00e9gociation collective dans une \u00e9tude en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[316] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe [310], la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a donn\u00e9 des directives claires dans la d\u00e9cision qu'elle a rendue dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes sur la question de l'objectif essentiel vis\u00e9 par l'article 11. Quant \u00e0 la question de pr\u00e9somption de discrimination, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 de cette question \u00e0 la Section IV C de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[317] Le deuxi\u00e8me argument de Postes Canada concernant la d\u00e9finition de salaires est examin\u00e9 dans le contexte de la Section VIII, intitul\u00e9e Formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirectes , laquelle figure plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[318] Postes Canada, dans son troisi\u00e8me argument, a soutenu que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale reconna\u00eet que la force de la n\u00e9gociation est non seulement pertinente \u00e0 la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes mais constitue \u00e9galement une partie importante de toute enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de discrimination salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[319] Le Tribunal conclut que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale limite son examen de la force de n\u00e9gociation aux :\n[...] facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte pour savoir si des employ\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent des salaires \u00e9gaux et ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la preuve d'une force particuli\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociation constitue une preuve reli\u00e9e aux facteurs en question, elle est pertinente et elle sera \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'analyse de fond 108 (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original).\n[320] Les facteurs sont mentionn\u00e9s par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi et dans l'ordonnance. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils sont par d\u00e9finition limit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 et aux facteurs raisonnables mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 16 de l'OPS de 1986.\n[321] Le Tribunal n'estime pas que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes approuve une approche ouverte aux facteurs raisonnables , permettant l'acceptation de facteurs additionnels comme la force de n\u00e9gociation en plus de ceux qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vus dans l'ordonnance. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale mentionne clairement que dans la mesure o\u00f9 la preuve d'une force particuli\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociation constitue une preuve reli\u00e9e aux facteurs mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi, elle est pertinente et elle sera \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par le tribunal pertinent \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'analyse de fond.\n[322] La force de n\u00e9gociation a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte comme preuve relative aux facteurs qui sont mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 16 de l'OPS de 1986 et qui sont reconnus raisonnables pour justifier qu'un employeur pratique la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes? Postes Canada a fait valoir que les diff\u00e9rences entre les philosophies de n\u00e9gociation collective du groupe plaignant et du groupe de comparaison doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es par le Tribunal. Elle a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que le sous-groupe PO-4, groupe historiquement neutre en genre, qui est important en nombre de membres et qui est un repr\u00e9sentant actif dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation collective pour le groupe PO, doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 en raison de sa philosophie de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration rectiligne .\n[323] La Commission et l'Alliance ont fait valoir que la force de n\u00e9gociation syndicale n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans l'ordonnance comme \u00e9tant un facteur raisonnable . Par cons\u00e9quent, les arguments de Postes Canada ne devraient pas \u00eatre pris en compte \u00e0 moins que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne lient ces arguments aux facteurs raisonnables . Tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t au cours de l'audience, l'avocat de la Commission s'est pench\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur ce point et a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nUn autre point qui n'est pas contest\u00e9, c'est la force des syndicats ou la force de n\u00e9gociation des syndicats, peu importe comment on l'appelle. On en parle pas dans l'ordonnance. On en n'a pas parl\u00e9 dans l'OER de 1978, dans l'OER de 1982 ou dans l'OPS de 1986. On n'en a jamais parl\u00e9 dans les ordonnances109 [...]\n[324] Selon le Tribunal, \u00e0 aucun moment les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sp\u00e9cifique de force de n\u00e9gociation en relation avec les facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi ainsi que ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'ordonnance.\n[325] La question de l' \u00e9tablissement n'\u00e9tait pas directement trait\u00e9 dans la plainte originelle. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par la plaignante pour mentionner que l'employeur, Postes Canada, aurait contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi en r\u00e9mun\u00e9rant plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement les employ\u00e9s du Groupe des op\u00e9rations postales, lequel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, que les employ\u00e9s du Groupe commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements, lequel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, et ce, pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale . De plus, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la composition des deux groupes quant au sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 le fondement de la disparit\u00e9 salariale, et, par cons\u00e9quent, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte qu'il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[326] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 M. Durber dans son t\u00e9moignage concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Commission du mot \u00e9tablissement lorsqu'elle traitait des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par des groupes \u00e0 l'emploi du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 l'emploi d'autres importantes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s nationales, il est clair que la plaignante et la Commission ont pris pour acquis, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, que le mot \u00e9tablissement et le mot l'employeur \u00e9taient synonymes.\n[327] Pour les motifs donn\u00e9s par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision qu'elle a rendue dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes , ce postulat semble \u00eatre juste. Bien qu'il arrive parfois qu'un employeur poss\u00e8de plus d'un \u00e9tablissement sous sa gouverne, dans la plupart des cas l'employeur et le mot \u00e9tablissement , dans le contexte de la Loi, seront indissociables lorsque l'employeur traite ses groupes d'employ\u00e9s comme faisant partie d'une entit\u00e9 commerciale int\u00e9gr\u00e9e poss\u00e9dant une politique commune en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires.\n[328] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada, selon lesquels Postes Canada fonctionnait comme une entit\u00e9 commerciale int\u00e9gr\u00e9e avec, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une politique commune en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires. De nombreux exemples de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont examin\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[329] En mai 1997, Elisabeth Kriegler, pr\u00e9sidente et PDG de Elisabeth Kriegler and Associates, un organisme de consultants en gestion du changement, a comparu devant le Tribunal. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e par Postes Canada comme t\u00e9moin ordinaire. Elle avait travaill\u00e9 comme vice-pr\u00e9sidente dans plusieurs domaines fonctionnels \u00e0 Postes Canada de 1983 \u00e0 1992. Elle a ensuite occup\u00e9 le poste de premier vice-pr\u00e9sidente, Administration, de 1992 \u00e0 1995. De 1995 jusqu'au d\u00e9but de 1997, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidente de Postes Canada, Gestion de syst\u00e8mes limit\u00e9e, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui poss\u00e9dait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle d'un certain nombre de syst\u00e8mes et de processus de gestion \u00e9labor\u00e9s au fil des ans par Postes Canada et commercialis\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle internationale, par des accords d'octroi de licence.\n[330] Mme Kriegler a soulign\u00e9 que l'exploitation d'un syst\u00e8me postal est probablement l'une des entreprises de logistique les plus complexes au monde car, dans le cas de Postes Canada, elle affecte non seulement ses propres employ\u00e9s mais \u00e9galement plusieurs milliers d'autres employ\u00e9s contractuels. [Traduction] Ils font tous partie int\u00e9grante de ce r\u00e9seau int\u00e9gr\u00e9, lequel doit fonctionner de concert et en conformit\u00e9 avec les normes et en harmonie [...]110 .\n[331] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe [33], pour s'aquitter de son mandat, la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat cr\u00e9\u00e9e en octobre 1981 devait [...] veiller \u00e0 l'autofinancement de son exploitation dans des conditions de normes de service adapt\u00e9es aux besoins de la population du Canada [...] . Mme Kriegler a mentionn\u00e9 que cela exigeait une collecte, un traitement et une livraison efficace et efficiente du courrier dans un cadre financi\u00e8rement concurrentiel qui, \u00e0 son tour, exigeait l'\u00e9laboration et l'implantation d'un ensemble exhaustif de ressources op\u00e9rationnelles, financi\u00e8res et humaines, de syst\u00e8mes de mise en march\u00e9 et de gestion.\n[332] Mme Kriegler a mentionn\u00e9 que les activit\u00e9s de Postes Canada [Traduction] [...] sont le cur et l'\u00e2me de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et que sans elles, ce n'est pas une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ce n'est pas une entreprise [...] 111. La cr\u00e9ation du Centre national de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 Ottawa, au milieu des ann\u00e9es 80, traduisait le besoin crucial quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un syst\u00e8me centralis\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le et de gestion des activit\u00e9s.\n[333] Les membres de la haute direction de Postes Canada se rencontrent quotidiennement au Centre national de contr\u00f4le pour examiner les probl\u00e8mes op\u00e9rationnels qui sont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s au bureau central par les centres divisionnaires de contr\u00f4le de partout au pays. Cela encourage les personnel qui travaille \u00e0 l'exploitation \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les probl\u00e8mes apparaissent. Le r\u00e9seau d'exploitation est appuy\u00e9 par un ensemble de syst\u00e8mes qui suit la trace du courrier partout au Canada.\n[334] Les membres du Tribunal ont eu l'occasion de visiter le Centre national de contr\u00f4le et de le voir fonctionner avec son flux de renseignements qui entre et qui sort et que l'on peut observer sur des \u00e9crans couleur dans une salle ayant une carte g\u00e9ante du Canada comme toile de fond.\n[335] Le r\u00f4le et l'incidence des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles de Postes Canada, notamment le Centre national de contr\u00f4le, sont peut-\u00eatre le mieux r\u00e9sum\u00e9s dans les commentaires suivant qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus par Mme Kriegler devant le Tribunal en mai et juin 1997 :\n[Traduction]\n[...] et en fait aujourd'hui, malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9centralisation et l'habilitation [...] le contr\u00f4le de l'exploitation est enti\u00e8rement centralis\u00e9 aujourd'hui et doit toujours le demeurer parce que d\u00e8s que vous le desserrez, le r\u00e9seau se met \u00e0 mal fonctionner. Le contr\u00f4le est centralis\u00e9 et c'est le r\u00f4le du Centre de contr\u00f4le et c'est pourquoi le pr\u00e9sident, le directeur des finances, le premier vice-pr\u00e9sident - marketing, le premier vice-pr\u00e9sident - exploitation et l'ensemble des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs s'assoient \u00e0 cette table chaque matin. C'est le contr\u00f4le central112.\nTous les employ\u00e9s savent qu'ils sont une composante ou font partie de ce vaste syst\u00e8me int\u00e9gr\u00e9113.\n[336] \u00c0 coup s\u00fbr, la nature des op\u00e9rations de Postes Canada et particuli\u00e8rement le r\u00f4le du Centre national de contr\u00f4le, d\u00e9montrent clairement que Postes Canada fonctionne comme une entreprise unique int\u00e9gr\u00e9e et traite l'ensemble de ses groupes d'employ\u00e9s comme des composantes essentielles de cette entit\u00e9.\n[337] Mme Kriegler a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que cela n'\u00e9tait pas limit\u00e9 au domaine des op\u00e9rations. La cr\u00e9ation de domaines de responsabilit\u00e9 fonctionnels de gestion \u00e0 la suite de la cr\u00e9ation de Postes Canada en tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d\u00e9passait de loin le domaine critique des op\u00e9rations. Mme Kriegler a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les diverses fonctions de gestion de soutien ont \u00e9t\u00e9 graduellement import\u00e9es des diff\u00e9rentes agences du gouvernement et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au point sous la responsabilit\u00e9 de Postes Canada avec son propre personnel.\n[338] Des fonctions comme les finances, les ressources humaines, les relations avec le personnel et les relations de travail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es peu apr\u00e8s que le statut de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat fut cr\u00e9\u00e9. Les achats, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux, la gestion immobili\u00e8re et les affaires juridiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s plus tard. Le personnel de Postes Canada a d\u00fb \u00eatre augment\u00e9 et des politiques, des normes et des proc\u00e9dures ont d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9es dans chacun des domaines fonctionnels.\n[339] Dans les ann\u00e9es 80 l'accent a de plus en plus \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur le marketing et sur la satisfaction des besoins des clients. Des points de vente et des contrats de franchise ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s. Un Centre de recherche et de d\u00e9veloppement a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 et de nouveaux produits, de nouveaux services et du nouvels \u00e9quipements pour Postes Canada y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us et test\u00e9s.\n[340] Sur le plan de l'organisation, selon Mme Kriegler, on a cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1983 un poste de premier vice-pr\u00e9sident, relations du personnel et des relations de travail. En 1992, Mme Kriegler, en tant que premi\u00e8re vice-pr\u00e9sidente, Administration, a assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 des politiques en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines, de relations de travail, de personnel, d'affaires juridiques et de plusieurs autres fonctions.\n[341] Mme Kriegler a mis en \u00e9vidence certaines situations o\u00f9 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par Postes Canada dans le secteur des politiques en mati\u00e8re de gestion du personnel ou dans des domaines intimement li\u00e9s aux politiques en mati\u00e8re de gestion du personnel ou politiques en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines, comme on les appelle le plus souvent. Une de ces m\u00e9thodes a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation de l'Institut d'apprentissage de Postes Canada qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un budget de formation centralis\u00e9 en allant chercher des fonds de programme de formation dans des unit\u00e9s de fonctionnement individuels. Un des principaux objectifs vis\u00e9s \u00e9tait la coordination dans l'ensemble de l'organisme de la cr\u00e9ation et de l'utilisation des programmes de formation destin\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s afin d'obtenir le meilleur rendement possible pour les employ\u00e9s et pour l'employeur.\n[342] Un autre exemple pourrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les strat\u00e9gies en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail et de n\u00e9gociations collectives, lesquelles, obligatoirement, touchent aux politiques en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Entre les s\u00e9ances de n\u00e9gociation collective, Postes Canada a coordonn\u00e9, au niveau de la haute direction, la cr\u00e9ation d'objectifs et de strat\u00e9gies qu'elle d\u00e9sirait r\u00e9aliser en collaboration avec ses divers syndicats. Mme Kriegler, \u00e0 titre de premi\u00e8re vice-pr\u00e9sidente, Administration, a soumis ces objectifs et ces strat\u00e9gies envisag\u00e9es au Comit\u00e9 de gestion pour que celui-ci les examine.\n[343] D'autres t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada qui ont comparu devant ce Tribunal et ces t\u00e9moignages faisaient \u00e9tat d'une orientation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale centralis\u00e9e dans des domaines comme la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux, les relations de travail, les politiques en mati\u00e8re de formation des employ\u00e9s et de ressources humaines. Ces exemples sont analys\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[344] M. Harry Phillips, directeur, S\u00e9curit\u00e9, Ergonomie et hygi\u00e8ne du travail, au bureau central de Postes Canada, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 1997. Il a parl\u00e9 du Guide de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui est entr\u00e9 en vigueur en 1989 en vue d'assurer une orientation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale appropri\u00e9e en regroupant l'ensemble des proc\u00e9dures fonctionnelles. Comme exemples, il a mentionn\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures qui ont trait \u00e0 des domaines fonctionnels comme l'exploitation, l'ing\u00e9nierie, les ressources humaines (le personnel) et les risques d'accident.\n[345] M. Ron Featherstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en d\u00e9cembre 1998, \u00e0 titre de directeur, Relevage et distribution pour le secteur nord de Vancouver. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que l'une de ses responsabilit\u00e9s consistait \u00e0 fixer [Traduction] [...] des objectifs \u00e0 long terme qui compl\u00e9mentent les principes op\u00e9rationnels de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi que ses objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [...] . Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat de la Commission, M. Featherstone a convenu que, selon lui, les principes et les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux visent \u00e0 guider l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et s'appliquent aux CR et aux PO ainsi qu'\u00e0 leur fonction respective114.\n[346] En avril 1999, Mme Joanne Hronowski, une agente de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour la R\u00e9gion des Prairies (elle a, \u00e0 l'occasion, occup\u00e9 le poste gestionnaire int\u00e9rimaire, R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avantages) a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que de nombreux manuels qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine par le minist\u00e8re des Approvisionnements et Services, ont guid\u00e9 dans leur travail les agents de la R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages. Des mises \u00e0 jour des manuels, des communiqu\u00e9s, des circulaires d'information concernant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme les avantages particuliers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us du bureau central. [Traduction] [...] Donc, la plus grande partie du mat\u00e9riel a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 au bureau central, puis nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e 115. Elle a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque dans sa r\u00e9gion \u00e9tait un syst\u00e8me national. Elle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] Il est enti\u00e8rement contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par le bureau central 116.\n[347] M. Charles Reece, un employ\u00e9 de longue date de Postes Canada et, tout r\u00e9cemment, directeur de la Section de la v\u00e9rification des revenus du Centre principal Gateway \u00e0 Mississauga (Ontario) a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit lorsqu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en avril 1999 en rapport avec la capacit\u00e9 de son installation quant \u00e0 la formation des superviseurs et du personnel :\n[Traduction]\nParfois, nous avons fait venir des personnes du bureau central. D'ordinaire, lorsque quelque chose de nouveau \u00e9tait introduit et que c'\u00e9tait quelque chose que nous ne connaissions pas, elles venaient nous voir et nous donnaient une formation officielle117.\n[348] En mai 1999, M. Frank Pasacreta, vice-pr\u00e9sident, Op\u00e9rations, \u00e0 l'Association des employeurs maritimes de la C.-B., a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Il occupait ce poste depuis 1987. Avant cela, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 directeur des Relations de travail \u00e0 Postes Canada \u00e0 Vancouver et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable de la R\u00e9gion du Pacifique de 1984 \u00e0 1987. L'avocat de la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Pasacreta si, pendant son mandat dans la R\u00e9gion du Pacifique, lui ou son personnel avaient particip\u00e9 aux n\u00e9gociations collectives pour les employ\u00e9s de sa R\u00e9gion. Il a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] essentiellement les personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation \u00e9taient des coll\u00e8gues qui travaillaient au bureau central. Un certain nombre d'entre nous ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques s\u00e9ances. J'ai particip\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 quelques s\u00e9ances, mais la principale fonction \u00e9tait la responsabilit\u00e9 du bureau central118.\n[349] Mme Karin Vogt, agente de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages, au niveau de la direction, \u00e0 Burnaby (C.-B.), a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en septembre 1999 que Rente de retraite, Proc\u00e9dures et autres manuels constituent une source importante de renseignements pour les personnes qui travaillent dans son domaine de responsabilit\u00e9. L'utilisation de syst\u00e8mes d'enregistrement informatis\u00e9s est \u00e9galement critique. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que les mises \u00e0 jour de manuels et les communiqu\u00e9s provenaient du bureau central. Elle a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que le bureau central organisait parfois les s\u00e9ances de formation. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elle a soulign\u00e9 que [Traduction] [...] l'an dernier quelqu'un est venu du bureau central et cette personne a examin\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 119.\n[350] M. Brian Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en mai 1999. Un employ\u00e9 de longue date de Postes Canada, il a pris sa retraite en 1995. Le dernier poste qu'il a occup\u00e9 \u00e9tait celui de directeur, Relations avec les employ\u00e9s, R\u00e9gion du centre. Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat de la Commission, M. Wilson a confirm\u00e9 qu'il avait compris qu'un ensemble de directives en mati\u00e8re de personnel existaient \u00e0 Postes Canada, dont la plupart auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par le groupe de la Gestion des ressources humaines au bureau central. Ces directives s'appliquent \u00e0 l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s dans l'ensemble de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et comprennent notamment les directives qui suivent :\nPolitique sur les langues officielles; Programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s (service de counseling et d'orientation); Politique sur l'information sensible; Pratique religieuse, Cong\u00e9 de maladie et de maternit\u00e9, Fonctions modifi\u00e9es, Langage gestuel; Droits de la personne et \u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi, notamment Partenariat avec les femmes, Harc\u00e8lement sexuel, Personnes handicap\u00e9es, Minorit\u00e9s visibles.\n[351] Le Tribunal conclut que la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e d\u00e9montre que Postes Canada, durant la p\u00e9riode de temps de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, \u00e9tait devenue une entreprise de mieux en mieux int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dot\u00e9e de nombreuses directives organisationnelles. Les directives organisationnelles s'appliquaient aux diverses op\u00e9rations r\u00e9gionales de Postes Canada, englobant ses nombreux employ\u00e9s dans l'ensemble du pays. En effet, la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnent \u00e0 penser que les relations de travail entre les r\u00e9gions et le bureau central \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s bonnes.\n[352] Les directives sur les politiques des Ressources humaines (ou du personnel) \u00e9manaient manifestement du bureau principal et s'appliquaient \u00e0 l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s en tant que membres de l'entreprise int\u00e9gr\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, les relations de travail, notamment les n\u00e9gociations collectives qui comprennent les consid\u00e9rations de politique de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, ont re\u00e7u une orientation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et m\u00eame une implication directe de la part du bureau central.\n[353] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l'ensemble des employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9, selon le cas, soumis aux m\u00eames diverses directives g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur les politiques communes \u00e9mises par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, notamment les directives qui avaient trait aux politiques du personnel et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Donc, le Tribunal conclut que, aux fins de l'article 11 de la Loi, les groupes d'employ\u00e9s repr\u00e9sentant le groupe plaignant et le groupe de comparaison travaillent dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement.\n[354] Ce faisant, le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\nD. La comparaison entre le travail effectu\u00e9 par le groupe plaignant et le travail effectu\u00e9 par le groupe de comparaison d\u00e9montre-t-elle que le travail compar\u00e9 est de valeur \u00e9gale? Les donn\u00e9es sur les postes\/emplois et le processus de comparaison entre le travail du groupe plaignant et le travail du groupe de comparaison sont-ils fiables?\n(i) Contexte [355] Les trois parties ont reconnu l'importance de l'utilisation de renseignements et d'un plan d'\u00e9valuation fiables dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. De plus, le plan et le processus choisis doivent convenir \u00e0 une \u00e9tude en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Cela n'est pas contest\u00e9. Toutefois, la question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir dans quelle mesure les renseignements sur les emplois et la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e pour leurs \u00e9valuations dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e9taient fiables. Si l'on veut arriver \u00e0 une conclusion raisonnable quant \u00e0 la valeur du travail effectu\u00e9 par le groupe professionnel plaignant et quant \u00e0 celui effectu\u00e9 par le groupe professionnel de comparaison, le processus d'\u00e9valuation doit \u00eatre fiable dans son ensemble, et ce, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[356] La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve un livret intitul\u00e9 Mise en uvre de la parit\u00e9 salariale dans la sph\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale120. Ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement \u00e9crit par le personnel de la Direction de la parit\u00e9 salariale de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 sous forme de livret par la Commission en mars 1992. Au moment de sa publication, la Commission \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e dans un certain nombre de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale , notamment la plainte dont le Tribunal est pr\u00e9sentement saisi.\n[357] Il est mentionn\u00e9 dans l'introduction du livret que celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des demandes formul\u00e9es par les employeurs et les syndicats. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans le but de fournir des conseils pour mettre en uvre des programmes efficaces de parit\u00e9 salariale en vertu de la Loi et de l'ordonnance s'y rattachant. Il est de plus mentionn\u00e9 dans l'introduction que les suggestions mentionn\u00e9es dans le livret refl\u00e8tent l'exp\u00e9rience du personnel de la Commission affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale , ainsi que les observations re\u00e7ues des employeurs et des syndicats au sujet des premi\u00e8res \u00e9bauches .\n[358] Bien que ce livret n'existait pas durant l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate (1984-1992) sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les id\u00e9es qui y \u00e9taient exprim\u00e9es ont progress\u00e9 au sein de la Commission durant cette p\u00e9riode. Il est donc utile de s'y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer afin de constituer le contexte dans lequel la Commission en est arriv\u00e9e aux id\u00e9es qu'elle s'\u00e9tait faite d\u00e8s 1992 quant aux plans d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, quant \u00e0 leur administration et quant \u00e0 la collecte des donn\u00e9es sur les emplois. Les paragraphes suivants sont des extraits des sections du livret que l'on juge pertinentes.\nPlan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois\nLe plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes . Il n'\u00e9limine pas la subjectivit\u00e9 du processus d'\u00e9valuation d'un emploi, mais le rend syst\u00e9matique et permet d'\u00e9valuer les postes de fa\u00e7on uniforme. Sans un examen syst\u00e9matique de la valeur des emplois, il serait facile de perp\u00e9tuer les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes courants concernant la valeur de diff\u00e9rentes professions - qui, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, sont au d\u00e9savantage des emplois occup\u00e9s par les femmes\nUn organisme peut adopter un plan fait sur mesure ou commander un plan normalis\u00e9 d'une entreprise de consultation. Ces derniers comportent des crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9cis, alors que d'autres font appel \u00e0 l'ordinateur pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des crit\u00e8res fond\u00e9s sur les donn\u00e9es r\u00e9unies au sein de l'organisme. Tous les plans reposent en fin de compte sur une pond\u00e9ration d'un ensemble de facteurs normalis\u00e9s en regard desquels sont cot\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents emplois. Afin d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un instrument acceptable pour la mise en uvre de la parit\u00e9 salariale, un plan doit satisfaire \u00e0 un certain nombre de conditions :\nil doit comprendre les quatre crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Loi et explicit\u00e9s dans l'Ordonnance : qualifications, efforts, responsabilit\u00e9s et conditions de travail; il doit mesurer la valeur du travail suivant une m\u00e9thode permettant de comparer facilement les emplois - ordinairement, on adopte un syst\u00e8me de points. D'autres syst\u00e8mes sont \u00e9galement acceptables dans certains cas, par exemple, des comparaisons par paires dans les petits organismes; il doit \u00eatre exempt de tout pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sexiste : Le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sexiste d\u00e9signe tout facteur ou comportement qui, m\u00eame involontairement, favorise injustement un sexe par rapport \u00e0 l'autre. Dans le cadre des \u00e9tudes sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sexiste peut influer sur la conception du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois et son application.\nParce que la parit\u00e9 salariale repose sur l'hypoth\u00e8se qu'il faut comparer diff\u00e9rentes fonctions au sein d'un m\u00eame organisme pour en \u00e9tablir l'\u00e9quivalence, il est essentiel d'utiliser un seul et m\u00eame plan pour \u00e9valuer tous les postes.\nEn ce qui a trait au plan lui-m\u00eame :\nles d\u00e9finitions des facteurs doivent \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et se baser le moins possible sur des exemples de descriptions de poste qui pourraient reproduire des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes - cela aide \u00e0 r\u00e9duire au minimum la tendance des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer certaines t\u00e2ches ou fonctions comme typiquement masculines ou f\u00e9minines; les facteurs utilis\u00e9s doivent int\u00e9grer tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants du travail \u00e9valu\u00e9, y compris les aspects des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine qui ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9s lors de l'\u00e9valuation; la pond\u00e9ration accord\u00e9e aux facteurs caract\u00e9ristiques d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine doit \u00eatre \u00e9quitable; les plans informatis\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre programm\u00e9s de telle mani\u00e8re que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants de fonctions traditionnellement exerc\u00e9es par les femmes soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9laboration des facteurs et leur pond\u00e9ration - d'ordinaire, il faut accorder une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des questionnaires pour \u00e9viter que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s ne soient n\u00e9glig\u00e9s.\nEn ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application du plan :\nla repr\u00e9sentation des femmes et des hommes devrait \u00eatre similaire dans tous les comit\u00e9s; les participants devraient provenir de tous les niveaux de l'organisme; et il doit \u00eatre dit clairement aux participants qu'au cours du processus de parit\u00e9 salariale, tous sont \u00e9gaux - les employ\u00e9s des niveaux inf\u00e9rieurs d'un organisme ne doivent pas craindre d'exprimer leur opinion et de contester celle des autres.\nCollecte de l'information sur les emplois\nEn ce qui a trait \u00e0 la collecte de l'information sur les emplois :\nles descriptions de t\u00e2ches ne doivent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es ou trait\u00e9es comme source exclusive ou m\u00eame principale de donn\u00e9es, puisqu'elles reproduisent souvent les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et qu'elles ne refl\u00e8tent pas toujours fid\u00e8lement le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9; il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de recourir aux sources d'information qui permettent au titulaire m\u00eame d'\u00e9noncer ses fonctions - dans la plupart des cas, on utilisera un questionnaire; le questionnaire doit \u00eatre soigneusement \u00e9labor\u00e9 et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre au moyen d'une \u00e9tude pilote, pour s'assurer qu'il englobe tous les aspects importants des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et f\u00e9minine, et qu'il refl\u00e8te la structure du plan d'\u00e9valuation; on doit \u00e9tablir clairement que le questionnaire doit refl\u00e9ter le travail effectu\u00e9 et non les t\u00e2ches th\u00e9oriques; les superviseurs doivent examiner le questionnaire rempli et formuler des observations ou des r\u00e9serves sur une feuille annex\u00e9e; et lorsque le questionnaire ne semble pas avoir permis de recueillir suffisamment d'information, les \u00e9valuateurs peuvent rencontrer les titulaires et suivre un plan structur\u00e9 pendant l'entrevue.\nIl peut s'agir de questions ouvertes, ferm\u00e9es ou des deux types, selon les exigences du plan, les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des responsables de l'\u00e9tude et la taille de l'organisme. Dans les petits organismes, il ne sera peut-\u00eatre pas possible d'effectuer les tests n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la formulation de questions ferm\u00e9es et fiables. Cependant, les questionnaires comportant des questions ouvertes doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s avec pr\u00e9caution. On doit s'assurer que les hommes et les femmes utilisent un langage semblable pour d\u00e9crire leur travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'on choisit des questions ouvertes, il faudrait donner des directives incitant toutes les personnes qui y r\u00e9pondront \u00e0 utiliser des termes exacts pour d\u00e9crire leurs fonctions. Des exemples illustrant comment d\u00e9crire diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches peuvent \u00eatre utiles.\nCoop\u00e9ration entre employeur et employ\u00e9s\nM\u00eame s'il incombe l\u00e9galement \u00e0 l'employeur d'assurer la parit\u00e9 salariale, la Commission croit que les programmes d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale sont plus efficaces lorsque l'employeur et les employ\u00e9s collaborent pleinement [...] Les deux parties doivent contribuer au processus. L'employeur finance les \u00e9tudes et tout rajustement n\u00e9cessaire, et fournit la perspective inform\u00e9e des gestionnaires sur les caract\u00e9ristiques des diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches. Les employ\u00e9s donnent les renseignements critiques sur les divers postes et l'appui n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la correction de tout \u00e9cart qui pourrait \u00eatre identifi\u00e9. L'employeur et les employ\u00e9s d\u00e9terminent conjointement la valeur des t\u00e2ches refl\u00e9t\u00e9e par le plan d'\u00e9valuation et son application.\nL'\u00e9tude conjointe d\u00e9bute g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par une entente entre l'employeur et l'agent n\u00e9gociateur sur les objectifs de l'initiative et sa structure de base. On peut \u00e9tablir un comit\u00e9 directeur conjoint pour choisir un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois appropri\u00e9, \u00e9valuer les postes-rep\u00e8res, mettre sur pied des comit\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation, pr\u00e9ciser d'autres d\u00e9tails de l'\u00e9tude et fournir l'orientation n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution efficace. La plupart des \u00e9valuations r\u00e9elles sont men\u00e9es par au moins un comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation comprenant un nombre comparable de femmes et d'hommes de tous les niveaux de l'organisme. Tous les rajustements salariaux jug\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la suite des \u00e9valuations doivent alors faire l'objet d'une entente entre les deux parties.\n[359] Le Tribunal estime que les points susmentionn\u00e9s d\u00e9crits dans le livret de la Commission constituent un guide g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'orientation ainsi qu'un mod\u00e8le de comparaison quant \u00e0 la collecte de renseignements fiables et quant au traitement de ces renseignements d'une mani\u00e8re qui, compte tenu d'un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois acceptable et d'\u00e9valuateurs comp\u00e9tents, conduira \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de valeurs fiables quant au travail \u00e9valu\u00e9 et compar\u00e9 dans le cadre d'une \u00e9tude en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[360] Ces points exprim\u00e9s par la Commission sont exactement les m\u00eames que ceux exprim\u00e9s par des experts comme Mme Pat Armstrong, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le Tribunal comme experte en mati\u00e8re de travail des femmes, de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des femmes et de sociologie de la l\u00e9gislation sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale. Celle-ci a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal en rapport avec, notamment, l'historique et l'\u00e9laboration du concept de parit\u00e9 salariale et des m\u00e9thodes utilis\u00e9es pour mettre ce concept en application.\n[361] Il convient toutefois de souligner que les points exprim\u00e9s dans le livret de la Commission sont fond\u00e9s sur l'hypoth\u00e8se que le processus de parit\u00e9 salariale sera un processus dans le cadre duquel un employeur et ses employ\u00e9s travailleront en partenariat. La parit\u00e9 salariale sera l'objectif commun vis\u00e9 par ce partenariat. Le livret et les suggestions qui y figurent concernant les \u00e9tudes en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale ne pr\u00e9voient pas le cas o\u00f9 un processus se d\u00e9roulerait dans un contexte litigieux.\n(ii) Questions pertinentes [362] Par cons\u00e9quent, les questions qui seront trait\u00e9es sont les suivantes :\nQuel syst\u00e8me ou plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour faire l'\u00e9valuation des emplois\/postes CR et PO et dans quelle mesure \u00e9tait-il fiable? Quel processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 et dans quelle mesure \u00e9tait-il fiable quant \u00e0 l'analyse des donn\u00e9es recueillies sur les emplois aux fins de l'attribution de crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9quivalence des fonctions aux emplois\/postes CR et PO examin\u00e9s? Quelles donn\u00e9es sur les emplois\/postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis, de quelles sources provenaient-elles, dans quelle mesure sont-elles fiables? Quels crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9quivalence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s aux divers emplois\/postes CR et PO et dans quelle mesure \u00e9taient-ils fiables?\n[363] Pour mieux examiner ces questions, faisons d'abord une distinction entre deux p\u00e9riodes :\nPremi\u00e8rement, la dur\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire de 1984 \u00e0 1992. C'est durant cette p\u00e9riode que la Commission a coordonn\u00e9 la collecte des donn\u00e9es sur les emplois et a effectu\u00e9 les \u00e9valuations des emplois.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi la cr\u00e9ation du Tribunal en 1992. C'est durant cette p\u00e9riode que l'Alliance a embauch\u00e9 une \u00e9quipe d'\u00e9valuateurs d'emplois professionnels compos\u00e9e de trois personnes pour examiner les donn\u00e9es sur les emplois d\u00e9j\u00e0 recueillies par la Commission, pour les compl\u00e9ter si possible et pour entreprendre des \u00e9valuations des emplois ind\u00e9pendantes du groupe professionnel plaignant ainsi que du groupe professionnel de comparaison. L'\u00e9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 active du milieu de 1993 et \u00e0 la fin de 1994 et elle a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 son travail en juillet 1997 ainsi qu'en juin 2000.\nE. Examen des renseignements recueillis sur les emplois et de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e : L'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate [364] Une \u00e9tude compl\u00e9mentaire conjointe employeur\/employ\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprise. On a donc pas eu l'occasion de cr\u00e9er un comit\u00e9 directeur mixte afin de coordonner la s\u00e9lection d'un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, la collecte de renseignements\/donn\u00e9es sur les emplois et l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. La Commission, par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, a assur\u00e9, avec la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e, lors de l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate, la coordination des questions relatives au suivi de la plainte.\n[365] Alors qu'une \u00e9tude conjointe employeur\/employ\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on qui aurait convenu le mieux pour traiter la plainte, le Tribunal conclut que l'absence de la tenue d'une telle \u00e9tude, pour quelque raison que ce soit, n'emp\u00eache pas le traitement de la plainte par d'autres m\u00e9thodes. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi; le mandat de la Commission consiste \u00e0 enqu\u00eater sur chacune des plaintes qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant elle en vertu de la Loi. Lorsque les parties ne peuvent pas \u00eatre amen\u00e9es \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier un r\u00e8glement, la t\u00e2che de la Commission consiste \u00e0 enqu\u00eater le mieux possible sur la plainte. Par exemple, le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la valeur d'un emploi en particulier devrait, normalement, \u00eatre un plan dont l'employeur se sert d\u00e9j\u00e0. S'il n'y en a pas, un plan d'\u00e9valuation ordinaire serait acceptable tant qu'il n'est pas sexiste et qu'il permet de donner un r\u00e9sultat fiable.\n(i) Les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission en 1987 [366] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe [17], les premi\u00e8res \u00e9valuations des emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par le personnel de la Commission en 1987 et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es recueillies en 1986. Ces \u00e9valuations faisaient appel \u00e0 ce que la Commission a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire de 194 postes CR. Ces postes CR \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce au plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois System One de Postes Canada. Aucun poste PO n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 en 1987.\n[367] System One est un plan qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 comme comprenant des facteurs qui font penser \u00e0 ceux de la m\u00e9thode Hay . Il comprenait toutefois un certain nombre de diff\u00e9rences par rapport \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation Hay standard, surtout en ce qui a trait particuli\u00e8rement au facteur conditions de travail. Au moment o\u00f9 la Commission a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur la plainte, System One \u00e9tait toujours en cours d'\u00e9laboration conjointe par Postes Canada et l'Alliance. Il \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 par les employ\u00e9s repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation de l'Alliance dans l'ensemble de Postes Canada. Comme Postes Canada l'avait soulign\u00e9, System One ne se pr\u00eatait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation \u00e9ventuelle de postes PO \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les titulaires de ces postes \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par d'autres unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation. De plus, l'Alliance a conseill\u00e9 de ne pas l'utiliser, m\u00eame pour l'\u00e9valuation des postes CR, \u00e0 ce stade incomplet de son \u00e9laboration.\n[368] Les principales sources de renseignements quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des 194 postes CR en 1987 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des imprim\u00e9s de listes d'employ\u00e9s fournies par Postes Canada ainsi que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi - un questionnaire d\u00e9taill\u00e9 - qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u par la Commission afin d'\u00eatre rempli par les employ\u00e9s \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s \u00e0 partir des listes d'employ\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s que chaque employ\u00e9 r\u00e9pondant l'eut rempli et eut joint la description d'emploi ainsi que l'organigramme pertinent, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9e par le superviseur et par le chef de division comp\u00e9tent. Le questionnaire, ou Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 durant la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de 1986. Au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli par des employ\u00e9s CR choisis au hasard comme \u00e9chantillon repr\u00e9sentatif des postes CR.\n[369] La Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un tel \u00e9chantillonnage de titulaires de postes CR serait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'un recensement complet de la population totale des CR, laquelle comptait environ 2 300 titulaires de postes CR, serait irr\u00e9alisable en termes de temps et d'argent. Un \u00e9chantillonnage al\u00e9atoire stratifi\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 en 1986 par un cadre sup\u00e9rieur de la Commission. Au d\u00e9part, il consistait en 246 noms de titulaires de postes CR plus 33 rempla\u00e7ants , pour un total de 279 noms. Par la suite, certains noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s et d'autres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s. Le v\u00e9ritable nombre de noms est difficile \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier \u00e0 partir des documents disponibles. L'\u00e9chantillon CR d\u00e9finitif qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 a pu comprendre, \u00e0 un certain moment, jusqu'\u00e0 355 noms, y compris des noms de rempla\u00e7ants . Ce qui est clair, toutefois, c'est que la Commission a re\u00e7u 194 Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, remplies et utilisables, de la part de titulaires de postes CR et celles-ci ont servi de fondement \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des postes CR de 1987.\n[370] Entre-temps, un Guide d'entrevue fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Commission, et ce, en tenant compte des commentaires formul\u00e9es par l'Alliance et Postes Canada. Ce guide visait \u00e0 orienter l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission durant les entrevues de suivi qui devaient \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des titulaires de postes afin de clarifier les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es sur les Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi. Un espace avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu sur le formulaire afin de permettre \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de consigner les commentaires fait par le titulaire du poste et par le superviseur qui l'accompagnait. Le formulaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vu par les titulaires de postes. On voulait que, tout comme pour la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, le Guide d'entrevue soit utilis\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9s CR et avec les employ\u00e9s PO. En fait, les deux n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s que pour obtenir des renseignements de la part des CR. En d\u00e9cembre 1986, toutes les entrevues avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es.\n[371] La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e comme source principale de renseignements sur l'emploi et les autres documents ont servi comme deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me source.\nComment les \u00e9valuations des emplois de l'\u00e9chantillon compos\u00e9 des 194 postes CR ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en 1987?\n[372] Une \u00e9quipe d'\u00e9valuation compos\u00e9e de deux agents de la Commission fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e afin de faire les \u00e9valuations. Ces \u00e9valuations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites entre avril et septembre 1987. L'\u00e9quipe a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par un des trois agents suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s progressivement en fonction de celui qui avait interrog\u00e9 le CR titulaire du poste \u00e9valu\u00e9. L'\u00e9quipe, compos\u00e9e d'hommes et de femmes, a utilis\u00e9 le plan System One et a tir\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 partir des Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986, des descriptions d'emploi, des organigrammes et des Guides d'entrevue.\n[373] M. Paul Durber, directeur de la Parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 la Commission, a mentionn\u00e9, dans son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal en juin 1993, que lui et l'enqu\u00eateur principal charg\u00e9 de la plainte avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9, vers le milieu de 1991, de rejeter les \u00e9valuations des postes CR de 1987 et de soumettre les renseignements de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 \u00e0 une autre appr\u00e9ciation de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. La majorit\u00e9 des agents de la Commission qui avaient si\u00e9g\u00e9 sur le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation de 1987 ne faisaient plus partie de la Commission. On a donc constitu\u00e9 un nouveau groupe. En cons\u00e9quence, les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation des postes CR de 1987 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s dans le processus final d'enqu\u00eate.\n(ii) Les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission en 1991 [374] Une nouvelle s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9valuations des emplois a \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprise par le personnel de la Commission en 1991 afin que celle-ci l'utilise dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate finale. Ces \u00e9valuations ont port\u00e9 sur 93 postes CR (la Commission a r\u00e9duit le nombre de postes \u00e9valu\u00e9s de 194 qu'il \u00e9tait initialement \u00e0 93) et 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . L'utilisation possible du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois System One, lequel \u00e9tait en pleine \u00e9volution, a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Commission mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 au profit du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay XYZ standard.\nComment les \u00e9valuations des emplois de l'\u00e9chantillon de 93 postes CR et des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ont-elles exactement \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es en 1991?\n[375] Le travail d'\u00e9valuation de la Commission consistait maintenant \u00e0 comparer les postes CR \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s et les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques dont la cr\u00e9ation avait r\u00e9sult\u00e9, essentiellement, de l'incapacit\u00e9 de la Commission et de Postes Canada \u00e0 s'entendre sur la taille des \u00e9chantillons et sur les instruments de collectes de donn\u00e9es quant aux postes du groupe de comparaison PO. La Commission avait consult\u00e9 Statistique Canada et avait re\u00e7u sa recommandation concernant l'\u00e9chantillonnage al\u00e9atoire stratifi\u00e9e de la collectivit\u00e9 PO, lequel comprenait les sous-groupes internes, les sous-groupes externes ainsi que les sous-groupes de supervision. Elle avait planifi\u00e9 proc\u00e9der en utilisant le questionnaire des Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi. Postes Canada n'a toutefois pas voulu que les titulaires de postes PO remplissent la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi durant les heures de travail. Le syndicat repr\u00e9sentant les PO n'a pas voulu que ses membres fassent du travail non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les heures de travail . Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a choisi d'utiliser les renseignements qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Postes Canada, et, \u00e0 partir de ces renseignements, elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un groupage de classes g\u00e9n\u00e9riques de postes PO - lequel comprend les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles internes et externes, mais ne comprend pas les superviseurs PO. Les 10 emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques n'\u00e9taient par cons\u00e9quent pas de v\u00e9ritables postes mais repr\u00e9sentaient les dix fonctions les plus homog\u00e8nes effectu\u00e9es par les titulaires d'emplois PO.\n[376] La cr\u00e9ation de 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques a exig\u00e9 que la Commission laisse tomber le sous-groupe des superviseurs PO (PO-SUP). Il s'agissait d'une mesure importante car le sous-groupe PO-SUP repr\u00e9sentait 6 niveaux diff\u00e9rents de supervision, lesquels comprenaient un grand nombre de titres de poste. Un bon nombre des titres figuraient \u00e0 plus d'un niveau, ce qui les rendaient difficiles \u00e0 faire cadrer dans les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi sans un \u00e9chantillonnage de titulaires de poste et sans l'utilisation d'une Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi ou d'un questionnaire. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'adopter les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , on a estim\u00e9 qu'il serait trop exigeant et que ce serait une perte de temps que d'analyser la question du PO-SUP avec Postes Canada. Alors que l'Alliance a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9e, Postes Canada n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'inform\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9cision. Un r\u00e9sultat important a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'incompatibilit\u00e9 avec l'\u00e9chantillon CR. Cet \u00e9chantillon comprenait les superviseurs au niveau CR-5.\n[377] Le personnel de la Commission a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une courte p\u00e9riode de formation donn\u00e9e par M. Roger Childerhose, un cadre sup\u00e9rieur chez Hay Canada, quant \u00e0 l'utilisation du plan Hay XYZ standard. Apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de formation, l'enqu\u00eateur principal de la Commission ainsi qu'un autre cadre sup\u00e9rieur ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9valuer, un par un, 16 postes qu'ils avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s \u00eatre des postes rep\u00e8res (10 postes CR et 6 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ). Ce nouveau travail d'\u00e9valuation a commenc\u00e9 en juillet 1991. Ils ont ensuite examin\u00e9 et r\u00e9capitul\u00e9 conjointement les 16 postes\/emplois, puis ils ont consult\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on p\u00e9riodique M. Paul Durber, le directeur de la Parit\u00e9 salariale de la Commission. Les deux agents ont continu\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer les CR-2 et les CR-3 avec l'intention de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer l'ensemble de l'\u00e9chantillon original de 194 postes CR et d'\u00e9valuer les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . L'enqu\u00eateur principal a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 de sa t\u00e2che afin de s'attaquer \u00e0 d'autres priorit\u00e9s et la deuxi\u00e8me agente a continu\u00e9 seule. On lui a par la suite adjoint un autre agent et un consultant externe. Ces trois personnes ont ensuite \u00e9valu\u00e9, un par un, des lots de postes CR et d'emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , puis ont effectu\u00e9 p\u00e9riodiquement, de fa\u00e7on informelle, des r\u00e9capitulations et des examens conjoints. Cette \u00e9quipe \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e d'hommes et de femmes.\n[378] En septembre 1991, \u00e0 mi-chemin du processus de r\u00e9\u00e9valuation des CR, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agente responsable de r\u00e9duire l'\u00e9chantillon initial de 194 postes CR \u00e0 un nombre plus facile \u00e0 g\u00e9rer. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la situation, elle a propos\u00e9 un nombre r\u00e9vis\u00e9 de 93 postes, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par la Commission comme \u00e9tant le nouvel \u00e9chantillon.\n[379] Les \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission ont utilis\u00e9 le plan d'\u00e9valuation Hay XYZ standard pour les 93 postes CR et les 10 emplois PO. C'est ce plan qui avait servi de base lors de leurs s\u00e9ances de formation chez Hay. Les sources de renseignements sur l'emploi quant aux CR \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans le cadre des \u00e9valuations de 1987, c'est-\u00e0-dire les Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pertinentes de 1986 avec les descriptions de poste \u00e0 l'appui, les organigrammes et les Guides d'entrevue. En ce qui concerne les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , les donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extraites des particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi , lesquelles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compil\u00e9es par la Commission \u00e0 partir de renseignements fournis par la direction de Postes Canada en 1990 et en 1991, ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir des descriptions de l'emploi et des profils d'emploi, lesquels avaient \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par Postes Canada.\n[380] Tout comme pour les \u00e9valuations de 1987, la Commission a utilis\u00e9 les Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi remplies comme principale source de renseignements sur l'emploi pour les \u00e9valuations des 93 postes CR. En ce qui concerne les \u00e9valuations PO, les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant la source principale.\n[381] C'est donc sur ces \u00e9valuations des 93 postes CR et des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies au plus tard en novembre 1991, que la Commission a fond\u00e9 les conclusions de son enqu\u00eate. Celles-ci, \u00e0 leur tour, ont men\u00e9 aux conclusions du Rapport d'enqu\u00eate final de la Commission de janvier 1992, notamment \u00e0 la recommandation que la plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e pour audience au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\nF. Examen des renseignements recueillis sur les emplois et de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e : L'\u00e9tape du Tribunal (i) L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle [382] Au d\u00e9but de 1993, alors que les proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es devant le Tribunal \u00e9taient \u00e0 un stade avanc\u00e9, l'Alliance a embauch\u00e9 une \u00e9quipe d'\u00e9valuateurs d'emplois professionnels compos\u00e9e de trois personnes (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e l' \u00c9quipe professionnelle ) afin de faire un examen sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 des \u00e9valuations r\u00e9alis\u00e9es en 1991 par la Commission de 93 postes CR et de 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et afin de faire des \u00e9valuations ind\u00e9pendantes. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e des personnes suivantes :\nM. Bernard Ingster travaille comme expert-conseil en ressources humaines depuis 1967 et il est notamment sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en classification et en \u00e9valuation des emplois. Au d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re, il a occup\u00e9 le poste de directeur des Services chez Hay Associates (Philadelphie), et, entre 1971 et 1977, il a travaill\u00e9 en affiliation ind\u00e9pendante avec Hay tout en travaillant avec des clients. Depuis 1977, M. Ingster travaille comme expert-conseil ind\u00e9pendant dans des domaines comme l'analyse et la conception de structures d'emploi et de structures organisationnelles, l'analyse de syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, l'analyse de pratiques d'\u00e9valuation du rendement et l'\u00e9laboration de plans d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Parmi ses clients on retrouve des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s industrielles, des \u00e9tablissements de sant\u00e9 publique, des \u00e9tablissements d'enseignement et des cabinets d'avocats. M. Ingster est dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 du Coll\u00e8ge LaSalle (Philadelphie) et de l'universit\u00e9 Temple et il est d\u00e9tenteur d'un doctorat de l'universit\u00e9 Rutgers.\nM. Martin G. Wolf a obtenu, en 1958 et 1959, respectivement, un baccalaur\u00e9at ainsi qu'une ma\u00eetrise en sciences, avec sp\u00e9cialisation en psychologie, \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 du North Texas. Il a obtenu, en 1964, un doctorat sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en psychologie clinique, avec mineure en psychologie industrielle, \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Case Western Reserve (Cleveland). M.Wolf a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re chez IBM dans la domaine de la gestion du personnel, puis il a travaill\u00e9 pendant un certain temps, \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 60, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de conseil en gestion oeuvrant dans l'am\u00e9lioration des programmes de formation du personnel ainsi que dans les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines. Il a par la suite travaill\u00e9 un certain temps comme psychologue de la gestion, travail dans la cadre duquel il analysait les exigences des emplois en mati\u00e8re de connaissances et d'aptitudes. Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 70, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 son compte \u00e0 Cleveland comme consultant en gestion sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en programmes de formation dans le domaine de la vente, du recrutement de cadres et de syst\u00e8mes de suivi informatis\u00e9s. M. Wolf a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Hay Management Consultants en 1974. Il a travaill\u00e9 au bureau de Pittsburg jusqu'en 1981, puis au bureau de Philadelphie jusqu'en 1989. Au cours de sa carri\u00e8re chez Hay, il a travaill\u00e9 avec un grand nombre de clients \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de syst\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, d'am\u00e9lioration du rendement et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Le dernier poste qu'il a occup\u00e9 chez Hay a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui de directeur, D\u00e9veloppement technologique. M. Wolf a fond\u00e9 sa propre bo\u00eete de consultant en 1989 - MAS Management Advisory Services Inc. - et il \u00e9tait toujours actif au sein de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lorsqu'il a comparu devant le Tribunal. Sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9laboration et dans l'implantation de syst\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation des emplois assist\u00e9es par ordinateur, d'administration des salaires et d'am\u00e9lioration du rendement ainsi que la gestion de projets de gestion du changement. M. Wolf a comparu devant le Tribunal en tant que porte-parole de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 pendant 30 ans dans le domaine de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois et que, au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, il s'\u00e9tait servi pendant environ 20 ans du processus Hay. Il a travaill\u00e9 comme corr\u00e9lographe chez Hay - un r\u00f4le de gardien de la flamme dans la maintien de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me. Il a estim\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 un peu plus de 10 000 postes gr\u00e2ce au processus Hay, notamment des postes de commis de bureau, des postes de comptabilit\u00e9 de paye et, au d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re, d'un certain nombre de postes de cols bleus. Le Tribunal l'a qualifi\u00e9 d'expert du processus Hay en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois et du processus Hay en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\nMme Judith Davidson-Palmer, pr\u00e9sidente EEO Associates, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'experts-conseils en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale, notamment en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9veloppement et de changement organisationnel et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. De 1982 \u00e0 1985, Mme Davidson-Palmer a occup\u00e9 le poste de directrice principale - Perfectionnement des cadres et du renouvellement de l'organisation - au si\u00e8ge social de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Elle est dipl\u00f4m\u00e9e de l'universit\u00e9 Mount Allison et elle est d\u00e9tentrice d'une ma\u00eetrise en psychologie de l'universit\u00e9 Queen's.\n[383] L'Alliance a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa preuve que, avant que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle ne soit form\u00e9e, M. Ingster avait pass\u00e9 une semaine avec les repr\u00e9sentants de l'Alliance \u00e0 examiner les documents relatifs \u00e0 la nature du travail dont la Commission s'\u00e9tait servie pour faire ses \u00e9valuations. Ces documents comprenaient des copies de Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi remplies des descriptions de poste ainsi que des Guides d'entrevue. M. Ingster a conclu que ces documents pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par un comit\u00e9 de professionnels pour l'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[384] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Ingster de faire [Traduction] un examen sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 des \u00e9valuations des 93 postes de commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements ainsi que des 10 emplois PO cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne121 . On a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, en tant que groupe, d'[Traduction] appliquer la m\u00e9thode Hay quant \u00e0 la nature du travail, et ce, conform\u00e9ment aux meilleures pratiques des experts-conseils de niveau sup\u00e9rieur de Hay, lesquels sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des experts quant \u00e0 l'utilisation du processus122 .\n(ii) Les phases 1 et 2 [385] L'\u00c9quipe a entrepris sa t\u00e2che en deux phases. Voici quelles furent ces phases :\nLa phase 1, qui a port\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9chantillon de 1991 de la Commission, lequel \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de 93 postes CR et de 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ; cette phase a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en mai et juin 1993.\nLa phase 2, qui a port\u00e9 sur l'\u00e9valuation de 101 postes CR suppl\u00e9mentaires. Celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en novembre et d\u00e9cembre 1994. Ce chiffre repr\u00e9sentait le solde restant de l'\u00e9chantillon initial de 1987 de la Commission, lequel \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de 194 postes (194 moins 93). Par la suite, 4 postes pour lesquels l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle estimait que les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient insuffisantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9es, ce qui a donn\u00e9 un total r\u00e9vis\u00e9 de 97 postes CR suppl\u00e9mentaires et un grand total de 190 postes CR \u00e9valu\u00e9s.\n[386] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a appel\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation des emplois qu'elle a utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre de ses \u00e9valuations, la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs Hay ou la m\u00e9thode classique Hay standard . M. Ingster a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une application de la m\u00e9thode Hay [Traduction] qui correspond exactement \u00e0 ses origines de comparaison des facteurs123 . M. Wolf a d\u00e9fini cette m\u00e9thode comme la m\u00e9thode con\u00e7ue \u00e0 l'origine par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Hay dans laquelle on \u00e9value la nature de chaque emploi par rapport \u00e0 la structure des facteurs pr\u00e9vus dans le plan Hay. Ces facteurs sont le savoir-faire, la r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes, l'imputabilit\u00e9 et les conditions de travail. On compare progressivement chaque emploi\/poste, facteur par facteur, aux emplois\/postes qui suivent. Cette m\u00e9thode a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e de comparaison directe, facteur par facteur et emploi par emploi, entre les emplois\/postes quant \u00e0 la nature compl\u00e8te du travail. Comme l'\u00c9quipe a estim\u00e9 que le facteur des conditions de travail \u00e9tait celui qui \u00e9tait le moins \u00e9labor\u00e9 des facteurs du plan Hay, elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un bar\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des conditions de travail plus \u00e9labor\u00e9 afin qu'il soit utilis\u00e9 dans cet ensemble d'\u00e9valuations.\n[387] Quelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les principales sources de renseignements sur l'emploi qui ont servi dans le cadre de la phase 1 et de la phase 2 des \u00e9valuations de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle? L'Alliance a fourni \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle les documents suivants afin de lui permettre de puiser des renseignements :\nLa phase 1 - 93 postes CR (mai\/juin 1993)\nles Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pertinentes de 1986 les descriptions de poste jointes aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 les organigrammes joints aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 les Guides d'entrevue pertinents remplis de 1986 les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de justification des \u00e9valuations de 1991 de la Commission, lesquels consistaient habituellement en une liste sommaire d'une page des t\u00e2ches principales et des principales caract\u00e9ristiques de chaque poste \u00e9valu\u00e9, facteur par facteur, du classement et du pointage attribu\u00e9es par les \u00e9valuateurs ainsi que du raisonnement sous-jacent, par facteur \u00e9galement. l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9galement eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses propres notes, confectionn\u00e9es au cours d'entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu'elle avait effectu\u00e9es en mai 1993 avec des titulaires de poste CR.\nLa phase 1 - 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques (mai\/juin 1993)\nles particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi compil\u00e9es par la Commission selon les donn\u00e9es obtenues de Postes Canada en 1990 et 1991 les descriptions des emplois obtenues par la Commission aupr\u00e8s de Postes Canada en 1990 et 1991 les profils d\u00e9crivant les caract\u00e9ristiques d'un certain nombre d'emplois PO obtenus par la Commission aupr\u00e8s de Postes Canada les donn\u00e9es relatives au comportement obtenues par la Commission aupr\u00e8s de Postes Canada les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de justification des \u00e9valuations faites par la Commission en 1991 une profusion de manuels, de guides, de formulaires, de mat\u00e9riel didactique \u00e9manant de Postes Canada.\nLa phase 2 - 101 postes CR (novembre\/d\u00e9cembre 1994)\nles Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pertinentes remplies de 1986 les descriptions du poste jointes aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 les organigrammes joints aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 les Guides d'entrevue pertinents remplies de 1986 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 les \u00e9valuations qu'elle avait faites \u00e0 la phase 1 des 93 postes CR comme postes rep\u00e8res dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation des 101 (97 en fin de compte) postes CR \u00e0 la phase 2, et ce, en raison du chevauchement dans les particularit\u00e9s du poste l'\u00c9quipe a \u00e9galement eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses propres notes, confectionn\u00e9es au cours d'entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu'elle avait effectu\u00e9es en septembre 1994 avec des titulaires de poste.\n[388] La principale source de renseignements sur l'emploi quant aux postes CR a \u00e9t\u00e9 les descriptions de poste.

La principale source de renseignements sur l'emploi quant aux emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques a \u00e9t\u00e9 les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la Commission pour chacun des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques .\n(iii) Comment les \u00e9valuations des emplois ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle? [389] La phase 1 : l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'est d'abord r\u00e9unie \u00e0 Ottawa en mai 1993 pour effectuer des entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec les 93 titulaires de poste CR de la phase 1. Les trois membres de l'\u00c9quipe ont particip\u00e9 aux entrevues par conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et un des membres a assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la tenue des entrevues et de la pr\u00e9paration des notes. M. Ingster avait divis\u00e9 en trois la liste des 93 titulaires de poste, de telle sorte que chacun des membres de l'\u00c9quipe s'est occup\u00e9 d'un tiers des appels.\n[390] L'un des buts principaux vis\u00e9s par ces entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques \u00e9tait d'obtenir des renseignements additionnels sur l'environnement de travail du poste occup\u00e9 par chacune des personnes interrog\u00e9s. On a fait cela parce que, de l'avis de l'\u00c9quipe, le facteur des conditions de travail \u00e9tait l'aspect le moins bien document\u00e9s dans la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986 ainsi que dans d'autres documents dont disposait l'\u00c9quipe. Une deuxi\u00e8me raison \u00e9tait de permettre aux membres de l'\u00c9quipe de poser les questions qui leur \u00e9taient venues \u00e0 l'esprit apr\u00e8s leur examen ant\u00e9rieur des documents relatifs aux postes. Les personnes interrog\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venues qu'elles recevraient des appels et elles avaient entre les mains des copies de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pertinente ainsi que des documents \u00e0 l'appui. Chaque personne s'est fait poser des questions sur son poste tel qu'il \u00e9tait en 1986.\n[391] Tous les titulaires de poste CR rejoints par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s. Quant aux quelques personnes qui n'ont pas pu \u00eatre rejointes, des employ\u00e9s qui avaient occup\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 le m\u00eame poste que celles-ci ou des employ\u00e9s qui occupaient alors un poste li\u00e9 ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de remplacer les v\u00e9ritables titulaires des postes de 1986. \u00c0 l'occasion, le superviseur comp\u00e9tent a pu r\u00e9pondre. Le nombre pr\u00e9cis de ces rempla\u00e7ants n'est pas connu. Toutefois, sur le total des 93 entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques possibles, on sait que 59 entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es.\n[392] \u00c0 la suite des entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de la phase 1, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'est r\u00e9unie, en mai et juin 1993, \u00e0 Philadelphie, afin de faire l'\u00e9valuation des 93 postes CR et des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . M. Ingster a assum\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sidence. L'\u00c9quipe s'\u00e9tait fix\u00e9e comme objectif d'\u00e9valuer entre 10 et 11 emplois par jour sur une p\u00e9riode de 10 jours. Chaque membre de l'\u00c9quipe avait re\u00e7u \u00e0 une date ant\u00e9rieure le mat\u00e9riel de renseignements sur l'emploi.\n[393] Les membres r\u00e9unis ont commenc\u00e9 par classer les renseignements sur l'emploi par ordre ascendant du total des points de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois attribu\u00e9s par l'\u00e9quipe d'\u00e9valuation de la Commission dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation qu'elle avait faite en 1991 de 93 postes CR et de 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ; ces renseignements provenaient de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de justification de la Commission. Un num\u00e9ro identificateur situ\u00e9 entre 1 et 103 a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun des emplois\/postes selon l'ordre obtenu.\n[394] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, chaque emploi a fait l'objet d'une discussion avant que l'on entreprenne le processus d'\u00e9valuation. On a fait cela afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute interrogation que les membres de l'\u00c9quipe pouvaient avoir ou afin de souligner un aspect particulier de l'emploi vis\u00e9. L'\u00c9quipe a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la nature du travail et \u00e0 attribuer un pointage \u00e0 chacun des facteurs Hay, puis \u00e0 comparer progressivement ces pointages emploi par emploi. Dans la plupart des cas, les trois membres se sont finalement entendus \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 sur une d\u00e9cision quant aux pointages des facteurs individuels. Un consensus de deux opinions \u00e9tait pour le moins exig\u00e9 pour qu'on puisse l'emporter, et ce, apr\u00e8s la tenue d'une discussion et non pas \u00e0 la suite d'un simple vote.\n[395] Au d\u00e9but de chaque journ\u00e9e, les membres ont examin\u00e9 leurs d\u00e9cisions et leurs pointages de la journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente en examinant leurs notes respectives. Ils ont fait cela afin de garantir l'exactitude de leur consignation conjointe du travail de la journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Le Dr Wolf n'a pas pris de notes mais a introduit les pointages des facteurs et des sous-facteurs dans l'ordinateur durant le processus de pointage.\n[396] La phase 2 : les trois membres de l'\u00c9quipe ont tent\u00e9 de faire les entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec les 97 titulaires de poste CR de la phase 2. Ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite ci-dessus pour la phase 1. Ces tentatives de contacts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 Ottawa en septembre 1994. Sur une possibilit\u00e9 totale de 97 entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, 55 entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es.\n[397] \u00c0 la suite des entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de la phase 2, l'\u00c9quipe s'est r\u00e9unie en novembre et d\u00e9cembre 1994, \u00e0 Philadelphie, afin d'\u00e9valuer les 97 postes CR. L\u00e0 encore, le Dr Ingster a assum\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sidence. L'\u00c9quipe s'\u00e9tait fix\u00e9e pour objectif d'\u00e9valuer environ 10 emplois par jour sur une p\u00e9riode de 10 jours; il ne lui en a pris que 9 jours. L'\u00c9quipe a suivi le m\u00eame processus d'\u00e9valuation que celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit ci-dessus pour la phase 1, avec une diff\u00e9rence cependant - l'ensemble complet des 93 postes \u00e9valu\u00e9s de la phase 1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 comme postes-rep\u00e8res. Un poste-rep\u00e8re poss\u00e8de d'importantes caract\u00e9ristiques quant \u00e0 la nature du travail qui sont utiles lorsque l'on fait une comparaison avec un poste non \u00e9valu\u00e9. Compte tenu de la similarit\u00e9 entre la nature du travail des postes de la phase 1 et la nature du travail des postes CR \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s de la phase 2, les postes de la phase 1 ont constitu\u00e9 des postes-rep\u00e8res convenables pour les \u00e9valuations de la phase 2.\n[398] La pratique habituelle veut que les personnes qui font des \u00e9valuations des emplois, pr\u00e9parent, \u00e0 des fins de consignation, un expos\u00e9 des motifs sous-jacents quant au plan d'\u00e9valuation utilis\u00e9, au processus suivi et aux pointages auxquels elles sont arriv\u00e9es, facteur par facteur. Dans le cas de la Commission, on a fait cela gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l' enonc\u00e9 de justification . Dans le cas de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, on s'est servi d'une piste de v\u00e9rification . L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a incorpor\u00e9 dans son rapport \u00e0 l'Alliance une piste de v\u00e9rification concernant les \u00e9valuations qu'elle avait faites \u00e0 la phase 1 et \u00e0 la phase 2.\n(iv) Deux examens suppl\u00e9mentaires [399] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle de participer \u00e0 deux exercices suppl\u00e9mentaires qui pouvaient avoir une incidence sur leurs \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures (phases 1 et 2). Le premier exercice, lequel a eu lieu en juin 1997, a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner un certain nombre de documents relatifs aux emplois que l'on venait de trouver. Ces documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9gar\u00e9s lorsque la Commission avait chang\u00e9 de locaux; ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9s au printemps de 1997. Les documents retrouv\u00e9s comprenaient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme de nombreuses descriptions d'emplois qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9gar\u00e9es, des photocopies plus lisibles et une clarification de traductions fran\u00e7aises. Ces documents touchaient 89 des 190 postes CR qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s dans le cadre des phases 1 et 2.\n[400] La question \u00e0 laquelle l'\u00c9quipe devait r\u00e9pondre \u00e9tait de savoir si les documents nouvellement retrouv\u00e9s auraient eu une incidence sur les \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 disponibles lorsque ces \u00e9valuations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. Un seul membre de l'\u00e9quipe, M. Wolf, s'est pench\u00e9 sur cette question. Il a conclu que, \u00e0 une petite exception pr\u00e8s, rien d'important n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 aux renseignements initiaux sur l'emploi. Les nouveaux documents n'ont tout simplement servi qu'\u00e0 confirmer les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures de l'\u00c9quipe.\n[401] Le deuxi\u00e8me exercice a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que l'Alliance eut demand\u00e9, en juin 2000, que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle examine les t\u00e9moignages d'un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada qui avaient comparu devant le Tribunal depuis le dernier t\u00e9moignage de M. Wolf. Cette t\u00e2che comportait l'examen d'environ 4 000 pages de documents \u00e9crits comprenant notamment des transcriptions officielles d'environ 70 jours de t\u00e9moignage et de contre-interrogatoire avec documents \u00e0 l'appui, des manuels ainsi que des documents connexes concernant la nature du travail. Ces documents traitaient principalement des emplois PO. L'Alliance avait demand\u00e9 cet examen afin d'\u00e9tablir quelle incidence les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Postes Canada avaient pu avoir sur les \u00e9valuations faites par l'\u00c9quipe en 1993 et 1994 des postes CR et des emplois PO.\n[402] Le rapport de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle concernant la preuve volumineuse de l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit comme contre-preuve. Avant que le groupe ne se r\u00e9unisse pour examiner la preuve de l'intim\u00e9e, M. Wolf a lu toutes les transcriptions des 70 jours de t\u00e9moignage ainsi que tous les documents \u00e0 l'appui. L'\u00c9quipe l'a charg\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer l'utilit\u00e9 potentielle des nouveaux documents quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Il a fait une s\u00e9lection en se fondant sur trois crit\u00e8res - la pertinence, la justesse et le chevauchement des t\u00e2ches. Cela s'est traduit par environ 36 jours d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve testimoniale et de documents \u00e0 l'appui sur lesquels il a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 ses deux coll\u00e8gues de centrer leur attention. Les trois membres de l'\u00c9quipe se sont ensuite r\u00e9unis et ont fait conjointement leur r\u00e9vision pendant cinq jours.\n[403] Apr\u00e8s une \u00e9tude attentive des volumineux documents s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, il est apparu clairement \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe que le travail effectu\u00e9 par les titulaires de l'un ou l'autre des emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques pouvait varier \u00e9norm\u00e9ment selon le lieu. L'\u00c9quipe a \u00e9tabli que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avaient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] \u00ab l'utilisation d'une seule description g\u00e9n\u00e9rique pour chacun des 10 emplois donne un document qui ne d\u00e9crit probablement avec exactitude que peu, voire aucun, des nombreux titulaires de ces postes \u00e0 volets multiples \u00bb [Traduction] \u00ab l'ensemble des 10 emplois PO semblent \u00eatre le reflet d'un amalgame de sous-emplois, dont certain peuvent se situer \u00e0 des niveaux diff\u00e9rents d'\u00e9valuation Hay, et ce, en fonction de la composition des t\u00e2ches aux diff\u00e9rents endroits124 \u00bb.\n[404] Vu cette conclusion, l'\u00c9quipe a mentionn\u00e9 que, en toute \u00e9quit\u00e9 envers le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, elle avait choisi d'accorder le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute aux emplois PO et d'\u00e9valuer chacun des emplois en fonction de ce qu'il semblait \u00eatre le niveau le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches couramment effectu\u00e9es par les titulaires de cet emploi. L'\u00c9quipe a examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des 10 emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et les a compar\u00e9s selon la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs Hay avec des postes CR class\u00e9s au m\u00eame niveau. Les membres se sont demand\u00e9s si, en cons\u00e9quence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels, leur compr\u00e9hension des emplois \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle qu'ils avaient au d\u00e9part.\n[405] L'\u00c9quipe a conclu qu'une grande partie des nouveaux renseignements fournis par les t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada n'\u00e9taient pas pertinents quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. L'\u00c9quipe a notamment conclu qu'aucune de ses \u00e9valuations initiales de poste CR n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9e par les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels. En fait, M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, durant l'exercice de juin 2000, il n'avait pas r\u00e9examin\u00e9 les \u00e9valuations CR de 1993 et de 1994 car il les avait accept\u00e9es comme telles125. L'\u00e9quipe a toutefois reconnu que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avaient confirm\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tendue des variations entre les t\u00e2ches de chacun des titulaires des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques \u00e9tait beaucoup plus importante que ce que l'\u00c9quipe avait d'abord cr\u00fb.\n[406] Peu de modifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es aux pointages totaux des \u00e9valuations suite \u00e0 cet examen. Sur les 10 emplois PO, cinq ont conserv\u00e9 exactement le m\u00eame pointage et trois ont fait l'objet d'une modification de trois points ou moins. Deux emplois, toutefois, ont vu leur pointage modifier de fa\u00e7on importante. L'un des emplois a vu son pointage total augmenter et l'autre a vu son pointage total diminuer.\nG. La fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois recueillis, de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e et des \u00e9valuations faites par la Commission et l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle : Les positions de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, de Postes Canada, de l'Alliance et de la Commission (i) La norme de fiabilit\u00e9 [407] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle les renseignements sur l'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis, trait\u00e9s et utilis\u00e9s aux fins des \u00e9valuations, il convient maintenant d'examiner la fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements sur l'emploi, de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e et des \u00e9valuations effectu\u00e9es par la Commission et l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[408] Quelle norme de fiabilit\u00e9 le Tribunal devrait-il utiliser? Bien que les trois parties dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte aient toutes convenu qu'elles ne cherchent pas la perfection en soi, il est n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir ce qui constitue une norme de fiabilit\u00e9 acceptable dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente situation relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[409] La d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, laquelle exclut toute norme absolue de la d\u00e9cision correcte, est utile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard :\nCe que font ressortir clairement ces observations ainsi que la nature du sujet, c'est que l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour fonctions \u00e9quivalentes est un but \u00e0 rechercher qu'il est impossible de mesurer de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et qui ne doit pas faire l'objet d'une norme d'exactitude absolue. De plus, le non-sexisme entendu dans son sens absolu est probablement irr\u00e9alisable dans un monde imparfait, et l'on devrait donc se satisfaire de r\u00e9sultats raisonnablement satisfaisants fond\u00e9s sur ce qui, selon le bon sens, constitue un r\u00e8glement juste et \u00e9quitable de tout \u00e9cart discriminatoire entre les salaires pay\u00e9s aux hommes et ceux vers\u00e9s aux femmes pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes126.\n[410] De plus, la d\u00e9cision rendue par le juge Evans en octobre 1999 favorise une approche flexible, au cas par cas, pour d\u00e9cider comment appliquer le concept de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9gale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Le juge Evans a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nEn bref, j'estime que la bonne interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 est que le Parlement avait l'intention de conf\u00e9rer aux organismes cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour appliquer la Loi une marge de manoeuvre pour d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de chaque affaire et avec l'aide de l'expertise technique disponible, comment appliquer le principe, inscrit dans la loi, de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour fonctions \u00e9quivalentes dans un cadre d'emploi donn\u00e9127.\n[411] Enfin, la d\u00e9cision rendue par le juge Hugessen en juin 1996 dans l'affaire Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale r\u00e9it\u00e8re que le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 un plaignant dans une affaire civile est celui de la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, laquelle se situe [...] loin de la certitude [...] :\n[...] Le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 un plaignant devant un Tribunal des droits de la personne ne peut, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00eatre plus exigeant que la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s appliqu\u00e9e habituellement dans les affaires civiles. Cette norme se situe loin de la certitude et signifie simplement que le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer que ses pr\u00e9tentions sont plus probables qu'improbables128[...]\n[412] Ces d\u00e9cisions appuient le choix de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable car il n'existe pas de norme de fiabilit\u00e9 absolue. L'application d'une telle norme d\u00e9pendra en grande partie du contexte de la situation \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude. La question, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances de l'affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi, consiste \u00e0 savoir si, selon toute vraisemblance, les renseignements sur l'emploi, compte tenu de leurs diverses sources, le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation, le processus utilis\u00e9 et les \u00e9valuations qui en ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 leurs lacunes, sont-ils suffisamment ad\u00e9quats pour que l'on puisse en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion juste et raisonnable, quant \u00e0 savoir, en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, s'il existait une diff\u00e9rence entre les salaires des employ\u00e9s du groupe plaignant et les salaires des employ\u00e9s du groupe de comparaison pour l'ex\u00e9cution de fonctions \u00e9quivalentes?\n[413] Si on se concentre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur les renseignements sur l'emploi et sur les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, un moyen suppl\u00e9mentaire pour \u00e9tablir s'ils sont raisonnablement fiables consiste \u00e0 les analyser en regard d'une pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise de l'industrie de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Des renseignements pr\u00e9cis, coh\u00e9rents et complets, voil\u00e0 ce que l'industrie a pour objectif d'obtenir, dans la mesure du possible, quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi qui sont utilis\u00e9s aux fins d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. La pr\u00e9cision exige que les donn\u00e9es soient justes. Pour qu'il y ait coh\u00e9rence, le m\u00eame genre de renseignements, un degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails et un niveau de qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e9gaux, doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s quant \u00e0 l'ensemble des emplois \u00e9valu\u00e9s. Pour qu'il y ait int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, il ne faut pas qu'il manque de renseignements importants sur l'emploi et il faut que les donn\u00e9es recueillies soient compatibles avec le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois utilis\u00e9.\n[414] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis par un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins experts constituent un facteur tr\u00e8s important qui affecte le jugement du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable des renseignements sur l'emploi recueillis, de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e et de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois\/postes. Le fait que plusieurs de ces t\u00e9moins experts ne partagent pas du tout le m\u00eame avis et que, parfois, ils se contredisent, est tout aussi important.\n[415] Dans ces circonstances, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 utile d'examiner les t\u00e9moignages de ces t\u00e9moins experts d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s syst\u00e9matique afin de voir \u00e0 ce qu'ils soient trait\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re uniforme et \u00e9quitable.\n[416] Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes lorsqu'il a compil\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent composer l'approche syst\u00e9matique.\n[417] La premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision est un renvoi, dans une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dat\u00e9e du 5 avril 2004, \u00e0 une discussion de la notion de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins dans les motifs rendus par le juge O'Halloran dans Faryna c. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.). aux pages 356 et 357 :\n[...] le v\u00e9ritable crit\u00e8re de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce que raconte un t\u00e9moin dans une affaire d\u00e9termin\u00e9e doit \u00eatre la compatibilit\u00e9 de ses dires avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu'une personne \u00e9clair\u00e9e et dou\u00e9e de sens pratique peut d'embl\u00e9e reconna\u00eetre comme raisonnable dans telle situation et telles circonstances129.\n[418] La deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision est un renvoi, dans une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dat\u00e9e du 14 avril 2004, \u00e0 une discussion des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s du t\u00e9moin expert figurant dans les motifs rendus par le juge Cresswell dans National Justice Compania Riviera S.A. c. Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. ( the Ikarian Reefer ) [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 68 \u00e0 la page 81 :\n[...] le t\u00e9moignage que l'expert donne devant le tribunal devrait \u00eatre le fruit d'un travail effectu\u00e9 par cette personne \u00e0 l'abri de toute influence quant \u00e0 la forme ou au contenu du proc\u00e8s et que ce t\u00e9moignage devrait \u00eatre per\u00e7u ainsi. Le r\u00f4le du t\u00e9moin expert consiste \u00e0 \u00e9clairer la Cour en donnant un avis objectif et impartial sur des questions qui rel\u00e8vent de son champ de comp\u00e9tence130.\n[419] L'approche syst\u00e9matique que le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 pour l'examen des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins experts vis\u00e9s est la suivante :\nDans quel domaine l'expert est-il qualifi\u00e9 pour t\u00e9moigner, et par quelle partie est-il convoqu\u00e9? Quel est le mandat de l'expert? Quelle est l'\u00e9tendue des connaissances et de l'exp\u00e9rience de l'expert et quelle r\u00e9putation poss\u00e8de-t-il dans le champ d'expertise vis\u00e9? Comment l'expert s'est-il acquitt\u00e9 de son mandat? \u00c0 quelles conclusions l'expert est-il arriv\u00e9? Comment l'expert a-t-il pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses conclusions au Tribunal? Quel poids le Tribunal accorde-t-il aux conclusions de l'expert?\n[420] Il est donc le temps de v\u00e9rifier cette norme de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable quant aux \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission et l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n(ii) Les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission en 1987 [421] Bien que les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations des postes CR de 1987 n'aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s dans le processus d'enqu\u00eate finale de la Commission, il est n\u00e9anmoins tr\u00e8s pertinent de v\u00e9rifier la fiabilit\u00e9 des instruments de 1986 et des renseignements sur l'emploi qui en ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'une grande partie de ces renseignements et de ces donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans les \u00e9valuations qui ont suivi.\n[422] La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi ou le Questionnaire, bien qu'elle ne fut remplie en 1986 que par un \u00e9chantillonnage des titulaires de poste CR, avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e par les employ\u00e9s CR et PO. Elle avait clairement \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue pour \u00eatre la source la plus importante de renseignements \u00e0 jour sur l'emploi. En fait, la Commission l'a choisie comme source principale pour ses \u00e9valuations des postes CR de 1987. Toutefois, selon Postes Canada, la conception et le contenu de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi comportaient de graves lacunes. Postes Canada a mentionn\u00e9 dans les observations qu'elle avait faites, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission, que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi relevait de l'auto-\u00e9valuation dans sa conception, une caract\u00e9ristique jug\u00e9e plut\u00f4t inacceptable aux fins de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Lorsqu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses objections \u00e0 la Commission, Postes Canada a propos\u00e9 des modifications importantes et a m\u00eame offert sa propre conception mais la Commission a refus\u00e9 les deux propositions et a choisi de poursuivre avec sa propre formule. De plus, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue pour cadrer avec le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation System One. Ce syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8tement au point et son utilisation n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait acceptable, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, selon l'Alliance et selon Postes Canada.\n[423] La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi ne rencontrait pas le mod\u00e8le ult\u00e9rieur propos\u00e9 par la Commission, laquelle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un questionnaire [Traduction] [...] doit \u00eatre soigneusement con\u00e7u et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, \u00e0 l'aide d'une \u00e9tude pilote le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant131 [...] . La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue et mise au point par un employ\u00e9 ayant de l'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission soumis aux pressions du temps et \u00e0 des contraintes en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines et ne disposant pas d'aide professionnelle. L'\u00e9laboration de questions pertinentes, leur ordre ainsi que leur formulation dans un sondage tr\u00e8s important qui doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s travaillant dans un organisme important, dynamique, tr\u00e8s actif, poss\u00e9dant un long pass\u00e9 de relations de travail troubl\u00e9es, tel que Postes Canada, appelait une expertise professionnelle appropri\u00e9e. La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le produit d'une telle expertise.\n[424] Certes, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue, ni v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e par un ordre professionnel ind\u00e9pendant. Les quatre personnes qui ont soumis le questionnaire \u00e0 un essai \u00e9taient toutes, soit des commis, soit des secr\u00e9taires. Aucun travailleur de type PO n'a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'essai. Les r\u00e9sultats de l'essai ont \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s par l'enqu\u00eateur principal qui a conclu que les quatre personnes qui avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'essai du questionnaire avaient souvent sur\u00e9valu\u00e9 leurs postes respectifs quant \u00e0 un certain nombre de facteurs. Cela a men\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines modifications dans le document mais la version finale r\u00e9vis\u00e9e n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 l'essai.\n[425] Les deux autres instruments, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des sources importantes de renseignements sur l'emploi, \u00e9taient des descriptions d'emplois et des organigrammes qui devaient tous les deux \u00eatre joints \u00e0 la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi par chacun des titulaires de poste CR qui l'avait remplie. Comme Postes Canada l'avait affirm\u00e9, de nombreuses descriptions d'emplois \u00e9taient d\u00e9su\u00e8tes. Un certain nombre d'entre elles dataient m\u00eame de bien avant 1986. En effet, un certain nombre d'entre elles \u00e9taient manquantes, un certain nombre \u00e9taient non officielles et d'autres ne portaient aucune signature d'agr\u00e9ment. De plus, l'Alliance n'\u00e9tait pas convaincue que toutes les descriptions d'emplois avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par les syndicats, un droit consacr\u00e9 des syndicats vis\u00e9s. On a v\u00e9cu une situation presque semblable avec les organigrammes. Ils ne dataient pas tous de la m\u00eame \u00e9poque et un certain nombre d'entre eux \u00e9taient manquants.\n[426] Le Guide d'entrevue, lequel visait \u00e0 aider l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission \u00e0 tenir ult\u00e9rieurement des entrevues avec des employ\u00e9s et \u00e0 consigner leurs r\u00e9ponses, a soulev\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves de la part de l'Alliance et de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 sa conception et quant \u00e0 son utilisation. On n'a jamais compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces inqui\u00e9tudes. \u00c0 l'instar de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour cadrer avec le plan d'\u00e9valuation System One.\n[427] Postes Canada a propos\u00e9 de nombreuses modifications importantes quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation du Guide d'entrevue. La Commission a choisi de ne pas apporter les modifications propos\u00e9es.\n[428] L'Alliance, par l'entremise de l'un de ses repr\u00e9sentants, a observ\u00e9, dans quatre des premi\u00e8res entrevues, de quelle mani\u00e8re le Guide d'entrevue \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 et, en cons\u00e9quence, a propos\u00e9 de nombreuses modifications pour l'am\u00e9liorer. Seul un certain nombre de ces modifications furent accept\u00e9es par la Commission. On a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accepter les modifications au Guide d'entrevue apr\u00e8s que le personnel de la Commission eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser la version originale. En cons\u00e9quence, des modifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es au document au beau milieu de son utilisation, une pratique qui n'est pas recommand\u00e9e dans le monde de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[429] De plus, l'enqu\u00eateur principal de la Commission a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Commission utilisait en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le Guide d'entrevue d'une mani\u00e8re s\u00e9lective avec les employ\u00e9s interrog\u00e9s lorsqu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier des contradictions ou d'autres difficult\u00e9s quant \u00e0 des r\u00e9ponses fournies dans certaines Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Commission, pour des raisons inconnues de l'enqu\u00eateur principal, lequel n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 son emploi \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape du processus d'\u00e9valuation, a choisi d'interroger l'\u00e9chantillon CR au complet.\n[430] Un autre facteur qui a provoqu\u00e9 une certaine consternation \u00e9tait l'origine de la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon CR. Un cadre de la Commission avait mis au point un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire stratifi\u00e9 sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement obtenu un avis professionnel. Ses calculs d'\u00e9chantillon ont fait l'objet d'un certain nombre de configurations comportant des rempla\u00e7ants suppl\u00e9mentaires, mais seulement 194 Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi acceptables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues. C'est ce nombre de postes CR qui ont \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es. Statistique Canada, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement consult\u00e9e par la Commission, a recommand\u00e9 que la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon soit augment\u00e9e. La Commission n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette proposition.\n[431] Enfin, le processus suivi par l'\u00c9quipe d'\u00e9valuation de la Commission \u00e9tait quelque peu inhabituel. Trois des membres de l'\u00c9quipe ont \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le servi d'\u00e9valuateur. Peu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue de la formation en \u00e9valuation des emplois donn\u00e9e \u00e0 ces \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission ou quant \u00e0 leur exp\u00e9rience personnelle en tant qu'\u00e9valuateur d'emplois.\n(iii) Les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission en 1991 [432] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, la Commission s'est fi\u00e9e aux \u00e9valuations qu'elle avait faites en 1991 des 93 postes CR et des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques pour \u00e9tayer les conclusions et les recommandations de son enqu\u00eate finale. La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9tablir la valeur, elle utiliserait le Syst\u00e8me Hay avec sa m\u00e9thode des quatre facteurs et ses graphiques XYZ. La Commission \u00e9tait d'avis que cette version de Hay \u00e9tait [Traduction] [...] tout \u00e0 fait capable d'\u00e9valuer les emplois de cols bleus et les emplois de bureau132 .\n[433] Ni Postes Canada, ni l'Alliance n'\u00e9tait parfaitement d'accord avec l'utilisation par la Commission, en 1991, du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay. Postes Canada, notamment, estimait que le plan Hay visait, principalement, le travail de type col blanc et le travail de type gestion.\n[434] Fait int\u00e9ressant, M. Wolf, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 une question de l'avocat de l'Alliance, a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 propos de la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation utilis\u00e9e par la Commission :\n[Traduction]\nEssentiellement, ce que les \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission des droits de la personne ont fait, c'est de cr\u00e9er leur propre m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation [...] ils ont express\u00e9ment dit qu'ils n'utilisaient rien qui ressemble \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode traditionnelle Hay. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu'ils utilisaient une m\u00e9thode de valeur \u00e9gale quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois [...] Je ne sais pas comment vous appelez la m\u00e9thode qu'ils ont utilis\u00e9e, mais il ne s'agissait pas du processus Hay133.\n[435] Il y avait \u00e9galement une certaine incompatibilit\u00e9 dans le fait d'utiliser le plan Hay avec une Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi con\u00e7ue pour cadrer avec le plan System One. Toutefois, System One, aussi incomplet qu'il pouvait \u00eatre, \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 correspondre \u00e9troitement au plan Hay. \u00c0 l'instar du plan Hay, il comprenait quatre facteurs pour \u00e9valuer la valeur du travail. L'Alliance estimait que les deux plans comportaient plus de lacunes qu'ils n'auraient d\u00fb quant aux employ\u00e9s PO en ce qui avait trait au facteur des conditions de travail.\n[436] Comme pour les \u00e9valuations de 1987, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e par la Commission comme source principale de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pour les \u00e9valuations CR de 1991. Par contre, la source principale pour les \u00e9valuations PO a \u00e9t\u00e9 les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi compil\u00e9es par la Commission. On peut pr\u00e9tendre que la comparaison r\u00e9sultante entre les postes CR du groupe plaignant occup\u00e9s par certains titulaires de poste et les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques n'\u00e9tait pas une comparaison appropri\u00e9e, compte tenu que les emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques n'\u00e9taient pas de v\u00e9ritables postes occup\u00e9s par des titulaires. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un exemple de traitement incompatible que les renseignements sur l'emploi ont impos\u00e9 \u00e0 toute \u00e9quipe d'\u00e9valuation qui tentait d'\u00e9valuer ces emplois\/postes particuliers dans un contexte de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[437] La diminution de la composition de l'\u00e9chantillon CR de 194 postes en 1987 \u00e0 93 postes en 1991 a sembl\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus d'\u00e9valuation. Le calcul de l'\u00e9chantillon revu de 93 postes a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 par l'un des \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission, un employ\u00e9 qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, \u00e9tait bien intentionn\u00e9, mais qui n'\u00e9tait pas un expert en \u00e9chantillonnage. On pense m\u00eame que l'\u00e9chantillon de 93 postes est peut-\u00eatre mal pond\u00e9r\u00e9. On pense cela parce que l'ensemble des 10 postes rep\u00e8res CR qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s au d\u00e9but des \u00e9valuations de 1991 et tous les postes CR au si\u00e8ge social de Postes Canada, ont cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 automatiquement incorpor\u00e9s dans l' \u00e9chantillon de 93 postes. Cela d\u00e9mentit l'id\u00e9e que l'\u00e9chantillon de 93 postes a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi au hasard.\n[438] Les \u00e9valuations de 1991 de la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans le cadre de la structure du comit\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e par la Commission. Les membres du personnel de la Commission ont fait leur \u00e9valuation chacun de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 et se sont r\u00e9unis p\u00e9riodiquement pour comparer leurs pointages.\n[439] M. Paul Durber de la Commission, a mentionn\u00e9 dans le t\u00e9moignage qu'il a rendu devant le Tribunal en juin 1993, qu'il croyait que le processus d'\u00e9valuation suivi par la Commission en 1991 se situait entre un minimum acceptable et un processus id\u00e9al, lequel id\u00e9al consisterait en une \u00e9tude conjointe employeur\/employ\u00e9134. Bien qu'il fut [Traduction] satisfait quant \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 et quant \u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence du produit des \u00e9valuations, M. Durber a mentionn\u00e9 que le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation n'\u00e9tait pas [Traduction] [...] un comit\u00e9 orthodoxe [...] . D'une part, son processus [Traduction] [...] \u00e9tait une sorte de d\u00e9rogation [...] car, \u00e0 sa connaissance, la Commission a en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale suivi - dans les cas de groupe - une approche rigoureuse de comit\u00e9 [...] . Par orthodoxe , M. Durber a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il voulait dire une structure de comit\u00e9 o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s avoir calcul\u00e9 leurs pointages, les membres se r\u00e9unissent, et, par un processus de recherche d'un consensus, arrivent ensemble \u00e0 une conclusion mutuellement acceptable. Le comit\u00e9 de la Commission ne fonctionnait pas de la sorte. Les membres travaillaient chacun de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9, puis ils se r\u00e9unissaient pour faire part de leurs pointages.\n(iv) Les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 1993\/1994 [440] L'Alliance et la Commission ont choisi de se fier exclusivement aux \u00e9valuations effectu\u00e9es en 1993\/1994 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en tentant de prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Un certain nombre de modifications apport\u00e9es en juin 2000 aux pointages des \u00e9valuations ont modifi\u00e9 les valeurs initiales des \u00e9valuations de l'\u00c9quipe.\n[441] Au moins deux membres de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s confortables avec le plan d'\u00e9valuation Hay et avec son utilisation pour faire les \u00e9valuations pour la pr\u00e9sente audience du Tribunal. M. Wolf et M. Ingster ont pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps chez Hay et ont travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es avec des clients en utilisant le plan Hay. De plus, soucieuse de rigueur, l'\u00c9quipe a appliqu\u00e9 ce qu'elle a appel\u00e9 la comparaison de facteurs, ou la norme classique Hay standard, qui, selon elle, \u00e9tait une m\u00e9thode plus minutieuse et qui prenait beaucoup plus de temps que les solutions rapides du bar\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation Hay.\n[442] M. Wolf, porte-parole pour l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, expert reconnu en \u00e9valuation des emplois fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9thode Hay, a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis que le plan Hay \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant capable de mesurer la valeur relative des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9minine. De plus, les facteurs du plan Hay mesuraient la valeur du travail en fonction d'un amalgame de qualifications, d'efforts, de responsabilit\u00e9s et de conditions de travail, comme l'exige la Loi.\n[443] Toutefois, des questions continuent d'\u00eatre soulev\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la pertinence de l'utilisation du plan Hay pour les emplois de bureau et les emplois de cols bleus , compte tenu de son utilisation notoire actuelle en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation du travail de niveau de gestion. Il s'agissait certes l\u00e0 d'une pr\u00e9occupation de l'Alliance et de Postes Canada. M. Wolf a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plan Hay, \u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts, a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9valuation du travail de cols bleus mais, plus r\u00e9cemment, c'est en rapport avec le domaine de la gestion que les clients font des demandes. Bien que M. Wolf e\u00fbt admis que l'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay se fait surtout dans le domaine des emplois de supervision, de gestion et des emplois de professionnel, lui et ses deux coll\u00e8gues estimaient qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s compatible \u00e0 la fois avec l'\u00e9valuation des emplois de cols bleus et \u00e0 la fois avec les emplois de bureau135. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que cette opinion est particuli\u00e8rement vraie lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 des \u00e9valuateurs qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 appliqu\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode Hay. De plus, l'\u00e9largissement par l'\u00c9quipe du facteur des conditions de travail de la m\u00e9thode Hay illustrait son adaptabilit\u00e9.\n[444] Bien que l'on puisse estimer acceptable l'utilisation du plan Hay dans ces \u00e9valuations - notamment par la tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tente \u00c9quipe professionnelle - les sources d'une grande partie des donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es soul\u00e8vent de nombreuses interrogations. La Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, laquelle visait, lors de sa conception, \u00e0 servir comme source de renseignements \u00e0 jour sur l'emploi, s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e tout \u00e0 fait inacceptable comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9. En effet l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a estim\u00e9 que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point peu fiable qu'elle l'a \u00e9cart\u00e9e dans une large mesure et a utilis\u00e9 les descriptions d'emplois comme document principal quant \u00e0 ses \u00e9valuations de postes CR.\n[445] Le commentaire qui en dit peut-\u00eatre le plus long quant \u00e0 la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi est celui de M. Wolf lui-m\u00eame. Il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit lorsqu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal en avril 1995 :\n[Traduction]\nLes documents sur l'emploi qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne exigeaient \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'interpr\u00e9tation parce que le formulaire \u00e9tait abominable. La personne qui l'a con\u00e7u devrait \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9e et fusill\u00e9e.\nLe formulaire contrevenait \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle fondamentale de tout processus de documentation sur l'emploi qui veut que l'on demande \u00e0 des personnes de d\u00e9crire leurs emplois et non pas de les \u00e9valuer. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 structur\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re [...] \u00e0 demander aux personnes de faire leur propre \u00e9valuation. Nous l'avons donc rejet\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement parce que les gens ne peuvent pas \u00e9valuer leurs propres emplois parce qu'ils ne comprennent pas le processus136.\n[446] En plus de son abominable structure, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, pour cadrer avec le plan System One. Il semble y avoir un conflit potentiel \u00e0 utiliser, m\u00eame dans un r\u00f4le moins important, des renseignements sur l'emploi fournis au moyen d'un instrument fond\u00e9 sur un plan d'\u00e9valuation diff\u00e9rent de celui utilis\u00e9 pour les \u00e9valuations. Selon le mod\u00e8le de la Commission, [Traduction] [...] il est essentiel de n'utiliser qu'un seul plan pour \u00e9valuer l'ensemble des emplois 137.\n[447] L'utilisation des descriptions d'emploi comme premier document pour les \u00e9valuations CR a pos\u00e9 son propre probl\u00e8me. M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'\u00c9quipe avait accept\u00e9 telles quelles les descriptions d'emploi du moment qu'elles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le format accept\u00e9 par Postes Canada, en pr\u00e9sumant qu'elles avaient servi de fondement \u00e0 la classification faite par Postes Canada quant \u00e0 ces postes.\n[448] Malheureusement, les ensembles de descriptions d'emploi qui ont servi pour les \u00e9valuations de postes CR \u00e0 la phase 1 et \u00e0 la phase 2 n'\u00e9taient pas toujours compatibles. Par exemple, ils ne comprenaient pas de formule de pr\u00e9sentation normalis\u00e9e. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, les descriptions d'emploi ne dataient pas toutes de la m\u00eame \u00e9poque. Un certain nombre d'entre elles dataient de plusieurs ann\u00e9es. D'autres n'\u00e9taient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par l'Alliance comme \u00e9tant des versions officielles , m\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient plus r\u00e9centes. Un certain nombre d'entre elles \u00e9taient manquantes. M. Wolf a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire que 14 descriptions d'emploi des \u00e9valuations de la phase 1 \u00e9taient manquantes ainsi que 11 descriptions d'emploi des \u00e9valuations de la phase 2. Par la suite, en juin 1997, une des descriptions d'emploi CR de la phase 1 manquante a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e et trois des descriptions d'emploi CR de la phase 2 manquantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9es. De plus, 5 descriptions d'emplois disponibles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es incompatibles avec la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, et, n'ont par cons\u00e9quent pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es. Il y a m\u00eame eu des exemples de pages manquantes dans un certain nombre de descriptions d'emploi. Environ 50 descriptions d'emploi n'\u00e9taient pas sign\u00e9es ou dat\u00e9es. Enfin, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les descriptions d'emploi ne comprenaient pas de renseignements sur les conditions de travail. Ces lacunes soul\u00e8vent la question de la coh\u00e9rence, de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et de l'exactitude de cet aspect des donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi.\n[449] Ces probl\u00e8mes ont grandement entach\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d'un bon nombre de descriptions d'emploi, notamment en tant que premi\u00e8re source de renseignements sur les postes CR pour l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. M\u00eame le mod\u00e8le de la Commission reconnaissait que les descriptions d'emploi ne constituent pas toujours une expression fid\u00e8le, \u00e0 jour, du travail effectu\u00e9 et reproduisent souvent les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes les plus r\u00e9pandus dans le milieu de travail et elles ne devraient pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es comme premi\u00e8re sources de donn\u00e9es.\n[450] La question de la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon de la population totale des titulaires d'un poste est un facteur qui, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, exige une expertise professionnelle. En l'esp\u00e8ce, un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire de postes CR devrait \u00eatre assez grand pour qu'il puisse, avec un certain degr\u00e9 de confiance, \u00eatre jug\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant repr\u00e9sentatif de l'ensemble du travail effectu\u00e9 par la population CR totale. L'augmentation ou la diminution de l'\u00e9chantillon peut avoir une incidence sur la valeur moyenne du travail dans l'\u00e9chantillon et dans la population totale. Il en va de m\u00eame de l'\u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire stratifi\u00e9 dont nous avons un exemple dans la r\u00e9partition de la Commission de l'ensemble des 194 postes CR en \u00e9chantillons individuels pour chacun des niveaux CR-2, 3, 4, et 5.\n[451] La cr\u00e9ation en 1986 de la taille initiale de l'\u00e9chantillon CR et les recalculs ult\u00e9rieurs qui ont permis d'en arriver \u00e0 la taille finale de l'\u00e9chantillon de 194 postes constituaient un processus non professionnel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 discr\u00e9dit\u00e9 davantage par la diminution de l'\u00e9chantillon \u00e0 93 postes en 1991. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a r\u00e9tabli cet \u00e9chantillon diminu\u00e9 presque \u00e0 son niveau initial en \u00e9valuant 97 postes CR additionnels. Les t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada et de l'Alliance ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir jusqu'\u00e0 quel point ces \u00e9chantillons \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sentatifs de la population CR totale.\n[452] Postes Canada a fait t\u00e9moigner M. David Bellhouse, lequel a comparu pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant le Tribunal en janvier 1996.\n[453] M. Bellhouse a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de professeur de statistique \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Western Ontario. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sident du d\u00e9partement des Sciences statistiques et actuarielles, poste qu'il occupait depuis juillet 1992. Il avait obtenu un baccalaur\u00e9at et une ma\u00eetrise de l'universit\u00e9 du Manitoba et avait obtenu un doctorat \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Waterloo en 1975. Sa th\u00e8se de doctorat avait comme titre Some results in sampling from a finite population under superpopulation models, 1975. M. Bellhouse a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re en milieu universitaire en 1974 comme professeur adjoint - D\u00e9partement de statistique, universit\u00e9 du Manitoba. Plus tard, il est all\u00e9 travailler \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Western Ontario, puis a gravi les \u00e9chelons; professeur adjoint, professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 (avec titularisation) et professeur titulaire. Comme pr\u00e9sident de son d\u00e9partement, il est directeur du Laboratoire statistique, lequel s'occupe de la conception et de l'ex\u00e9cution de recherches et d'enqu\u00eates statistiques pour d'autres selon le principe de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des co\u00fbts. Il a estim\u00e9 que sa charge de travail quant \u00e0 la recherche, l'enseignement et l'administration \u00e9tait r\u00e9partie selon un pourcentage de 40-20-40. M. Bellhouse a publi\u00e9 de nombreux articles dans des publications revues par un comit\u00e9 de lecture (approuv\u00e9s par des coll\u00e8gues) dans son champ d'expertise. Il a mentionn\u00e9 quelque 40 de ces articles traitant de sujets comme les techniques d'\u00e9chantillonnage, la mod\u00e9lisation et l'analyse statistique. En 1985, M. Bellhouse a re\u00e7u de l'universit\u00e9 une m\u00e9daille d'or d'excellence en enseignement. Des subventions de recherche ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque ann\u00e9e depuis 1976-77 par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\u00e9nie \u00e0 l'appui des travaux de M. Bellhouse. M. Bellhouse est Fellow de l'American Statistical Association. Son titre de Fellow lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 en raison de sa recherche en \u00e9chantillonnage d'enqu\u00eate. Il est \u00e9galement membre \u00e9lu de l'Institut international de statistique.\n[454] M. Bellhouse a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le Tribunal comme \u00e9tant un expert en statistique, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en \u00e9chantillonnage d'enqu\u00eate (l'\u00e9chantillonnage d'enqu\u00eate englobe la collecte et l'analyse de donn\u00e9es). Il a soulign\u00e9 que lorsqu'une personne souhaite obtenir des renseignements individuels sur l'ensemble des unit\u00e9s d'une population, cette personne exige un recensement de l'ensemble de ces unit\u00e9s parce que [Traduction] la technique de s\u00e9lection d'\u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire \u00e0 elle seule [...] ne peut fournir aucun renseignement sur les unit\u00e9s qui ne font pas partie de l'\u00e9chantillon138 . M. Bellhouse a mentionn\u00e9 dans son rapport que, en accord avec l'opinion de M. Wolf que l'objet de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois est de [Traduction] tenter de compenser chaque poste en fonction de sa valeur139 , on doit utiliser un recensement complet plut\u00f4t qu'un \u00e9chantillon quelconque car l'[Traduction] \u00e9valuation de postes \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s ne fournit aucun renseignement sur les autres postes qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s140 .\n[455] Si, toutefois, on doit utiliser un \u00e9chantillonnage, M. Bellhouse a mis l'accent sur la nature scientifique de cet instrument et sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de se doter de lignes directrices strictes afin d'\u00e9viter la partialit\u00e9 et afin de tirer des conclusions qui seraient utiles \u00e0 des fins d'\u00e9valuation. Parmi ses conclusions concernant l'\u00e9chantillonnage effectu\u00e9 par la Commission, M. Bellhouse a conclu que l'\u00e9chantillonnage initial \u00e9tait une m\u00e9thode appropri\u00e9e pour voir si oui ou non l'affectation actuelle de postes au niveau de classification CR cr\u00e9\u00e9e afin d'\u00eatre utilis\u00e9e par les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, puis utilis\u00e9e par Postes Canada, concordait avec les fourchettes de pr\u00e9visions non chevauchantes du plan Hay.\n[456] Il a poursuivi en affirmant que lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que les niveaux de classification CR \u00e9taient compos\u00e9s de fourchettes de pr\u00e9vision chevauchantes du plan Hay, un recensement de l'ensemble des postes \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de telle sorte que chacun des postes (ou emplois) re\u00e7oive une valeur au moyen du processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[457] M. Bellhouse a conclu que, m\u00eame s'il pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9valuation, l'\u00e9chantillonnage fait par la Commission en 1986 pour la population CR \u00e9tait vici\u00e9 dans sa conception en ce qu'il s'attachait aux employ\u00e9s plut\u00f4t qu'aux postes. Il a estim\u00e9 que ce choix d'\u00e9chantillonnage des employ\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que des postes [Traduction] avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 de la partialit\u00e9 dans le sondage en ce sens qu'il y [avait] des postes que l'on ne [pouvait] pas \u00e9chantillonner141 . Il a poursuivi en concluant que cette partialit\u00e9 \u00e9tait aggrav\u00e9e par le nombre de cas de non-r\u00e9ponses au sondage \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard desquelles aucune mesure de suivi corrective n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\n[458] La conclusion de M. Bellhouse quant au groupe occupationnel PO \u00e9tait qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas d' \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire de ce groupe occupationnel, il n'y avait aucune estimation d'\u00e9chantillonnage valide de la valeur moyenne de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois pour chaque niveau PO. En effet, parce que la valeur de l'emploi par niveau \u00e9tait mesur\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente pour les groupes PO et les groupes CR - le groupe CR ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 en utilisant des postes et le groupe PO ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 en utilisant des titres d'emploi - ces \u00e9valuations ne peuvent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour faire une comparaison des valeurs de l'emploi entre les deux groupes.\n[459] M. Bellhouse a \u00e9galement conclu qu'il peut y avoir eu une partialit\u00e9 dans la s\u00e9lection importante dans l'\u00e9chantillon PO parce qu'il s'agissait d'une s\u00e9lection de titres d'emploi plut\u00f4t que des postes eux-m\u00eames et \u00e9galement parce que les descriptions d'emploi repr\u00e9sentait une nature du travail g\u00e9n\u00e9rique plut\u00f4t que r\u00e9elle. Il a donn\u00e9 l'exemple suivant pour illustrer son point :\n[Traduction]\nil est possible que la partialit\u00e9 s'infiltre dans ce qui est la v\u00e9ritable valeur quant \u00e0, disons, un facteur, parce qu'il s'agit d'une description d'emploi g\u00e9n\u00e9rique qui ne saisirait peut-\u00eatre pas la variabilit\u00e9 dans la valeur de l'emploi qui est pr\u00e9sente dans la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale142.\n[460] La Commission a fait t\u00e9moigner M. John Kervin, lequel a comparu pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant le Tribunal en janvier 2002.\n[461] M. Kervin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de professeur au d\u00e9partement de sociologie et de chercheur au centre de relations industrielles de l'universit\u00e9 de Toronto. Il a obtenu son baccalaur\u00e9at en sociologie de l'universit\u00e9 de Colombie-Britannique et son doctorat \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 John Hopkins \u00e0 Baltimore en 1972. Sa th\u00e8se de doctorat portait le titre suivant : An Information-Combining Model for the Formation of Performance Expectations in Small Groups. M. Kervin a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re de professeur en 1971 comme professeur adjoint \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Toronto et est devenu professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 (titularis\u00e9) en 1976. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 conjointement au Centre de relations industrielles en 1977, o\u00f9 s'accomplit en grande partie son travail de recherche. M. Kervin a mentionn\u00e9 qu'une partie importante de sa carri\u00e8re en enseignement et en recherche avait eu trait aux m\u00e9thodes statistiques et \u00e0 l'analyse de donn\u00e9es ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'effet du genre sur l'interaction sociale. Il a effectu\u00e9 des projets de recherche comme Measuring Gender Bias in Wages et a publi\u00e9 un certain nombre d'articles revus par un comit\u00e9 de lecture, notamment un article intitul\u00e9 Where's the Bias? : Sources and Types of Gender Bias in Job Evaluation. Parmi les clients qui ont fait appel aux services de recherche de M. Kervin, on retrouve le Conseil de gestion de l'Ontario et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada. Certaines de ces recherches comportaient des analyses de donn\u00e9es statistiques dans un contexte de parit\u00e9 salariale . Un exemple de travail fait conjointement par M. Kervin et une autre partie, en l'esp\u00e8ce Mme Nan Weiner : Report on Possible Gender Bias in the Bank of Montreal's Hay-Points Compensation System - 1999. M. Kervin est un membre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne de sociologie et d'anthropologie et de l'American Sociological Association. Il est \u00e9galement membre de trois associations de relations industrielles.\n[462] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Kervin, lequel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la Commission \u00e0 titre d'expert en collecte et analyse de donn\u00e9es (l'analyse de donn\u00e9es comprend l'utilisation de statistiques et de m\u00e9thodologie statistique), contredit d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bellhouse. La principale critique de M. Kervin \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rapport de M. Bellhouse est qu'il repose sur un fondement erron\u00e9. Alors que le rapport de M. Bellhouse met l'accent sur la nature analytique de l'analyse statistique et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de fiabilit\u00e9 scientifique, M. Kervin a mentionn\u00e9 que, lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne sociologique, on doit placer le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dans le contexte de sa culture sociale. Afin de faire cela, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment-cl\u00e9 de la collecte de donn\u00e9es concernant le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne \u00e9tudi\u00e9 est la formulation, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, d'une question juste. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son rapport que M. Bellhouse n'a jamais pos\u00e9 la question pertinente, compte tenu du contexte de la plainte143. M. Bellhouse s'est souci\u00e9 que l'analyse des donn\u00e9es, faite avec les donn\u00e9es recueillies, suivent la m\u00e9thode scientifique. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement soucieux que l'analyse emploie des proc\u00e9dures ainsi que des preuves et des crit\u00e8res empiriques qui peuvent \u00eatre reproduits. Ce souci reposait sur la croyance qu'il avait que la parit\u00e9 salariale incarne le principe que [Traduction] tout le monde devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 selon ce que vaut son emploi .\n[463] Selon M. Kervin, cela n'est pas juste. Il estimait que la v\u00e9ritable question en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale est [Traduction] existe-t-il un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9num\u00e9ration fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, d\u00e9terminante pour la valeur du travail 144? Selon le rapport de M. Kervin, il en est ainsi parce que le concept de parit\u00e9 salariale part du principe qu'il existe une disparit\u00e9 salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Ce que l'on veut faire lorsque l'on v\u00e9rifie cette hypoth\u00e8se c'est dresser la liste des emplois, la composition de ces emplois quant au sexe, les valeurs des emplois et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[464] M. Kervin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il d\u00e9sirerait examiner les emplois quantitativement et qualitativement, et, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du jugement qui provient de l'aspect art du traitement de questions sociologiques. Le rapport de M. Bellhouse n'a pas tenu compte de l'aspect art , ni de l'aspect science de la plainte. Cette difficult\u00e9, conjugu\u00e9e avec son insistance qu'il existe une corr\u00e9lation entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les niveaux de classification, devrait, selon M. Kervin, faire dispara\u00eetre les inqui\u00e9tudes exprim\u00e9es par M. Bellhouse concernant le processus d'\u00e9chantillonnage de la Commission. Cette pr\u00e9occupation concernant la corr\u00e9lation entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les niveaux de classification indique, selon M. Kervin, que M. Bellhouse ne comprend pas les fondements syst\u00e9miques de la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[465] M. Kervin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son rapport que les conclusions de M. Bellhouse traitent, principalement, de questions d'\u00e9chantillonnage et de mesure de valeur d'emploi. M. Kervin ne souscrit pas, dans l'ensemble, \u00e0 ces conclusions.\n[466] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, M. Kervin \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il n'est aucunement n\u00e9cessaire de faire un recensement de la population totale vis\u00e9e pour rencontrer l'objectif de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Un \u00e9chantillon repr\u00e9sentatif est plus que suffisant. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que la justification de M. Bellhouse pour l'utilisation d'un recensement - le chevauchement des pointages Hay relatifs aux emplois dans l'ensemble des niveaux de classification CR - est invalide parce que le chevauchement n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillonnage. Il est uniquement d\u00fb \u00e0 l'utilisation d'une mesure diff\u00e9rente de la valeur des emplois. Il y a toujours du chevauchement peu importe le type d'\u00e9chantillonnage.\n[467] M. Kervin a jug\u00e9 invalide l'argument de M. Bellhouse que l'\u00e9chantillon de 1986 \u00e9tait erron\u00e9 parce qu'il s'attachait \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 des postes et, par cons\u00e9quent, a men\u00e9 \u00e0 de la partialit\u00e9 et \u00e0 des taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de non-r\u00e9ponses. M. Kervin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'avait d\u00e9couvert aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant cette position.\n[468] M. Kervin est d'accord avec M. Bellhouse pour affirmer que l'\u00e9chantillon PO n'\u00e9tait pas un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire, mais plut\u00f4t un \u00e9chantillon choisi \u00e0 dessein. Toutefois, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de M. Bellhouse, M. Kervin a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il \u00e9tait probable qu'il soit raisonnablement exact. Il croyait qu'il s'agissait-l\u00e0 de l'un des exemples o\u00f9 lui et M. Bellhouse posaient des questions de recherche diff\u00e9rentes - M. Bellhouse recherche la pr\u00e9cision et la signification statistique alors que M. Kervin r\u00e9pond aux besoins d'une situation de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[469] M. Kervin n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord avec M. Bellhouse pour affirmer qu'il peut y avoir une partialit\u00e9 dans la s\u00e9lection importante de l'\u00e9chantillon PO. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Bellhouse n'a aucunement discut\u00e9 du mode de s\u00e9lection ou de la possibilit\u00e9 de partialit\u00e9 dans la s\u00e9lection occasionn\u00e9e par l'utilisation de titres d'emploi et de descriptions g\u00e9n\u00e9riques.\n[470] Enfin, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la mesure de la valeur de l'emploi au niveau des titres d'emploi pour les PO et des postes pour les CR, M. Kervin a class\u00e9 cela comme une diff\u00e9rence dans l'unit\u00e9 d'analyse et non comme une diff\u00e9rence dans la mesure. M. Kervin a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait-l\u00e0 d'une situation qui peut facilement \u00eatre corrig\u00e9e.\n[471] De toute \u00e9vidence, il existe une s\u00e9rieuse divergence d'opinion, voire m\u00eame une contradiction, entre ces deux t\u00e9moins experts quant aux questions d'\u00e9chantillonnage et de mesure de la valeur des emplois.\n[472] Les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi utilis\u00e9es pour les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques \u00e9taient, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, semblables aux Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi CR. Les renseignements accumul\u00e9s pour celles-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Postes Canada qui a \u00e9galement fourni un certain nombre de descriptions d'emploi PO fond\u00e9s sur les titres d'emploi des 10 emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . Un certain nombre de descriptions d'emploi \u00e9taient non officielles car elles n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par les syndicats concern\u00e9s. Bien que, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elles comprenaient plus de renseignements \u00e0 jour que les Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi CR, les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi ne repr\u00e9sentaient pas des postes pr\u00e9cis d\u00e9tenus par des titulaires, mais \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t un amalgame de fonctions pour les 10 types d'emplois les plus r\u00e9pandus. Il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une comparaison in\u00e9gale et incompatible entre les emplois du groupe plaignant et ceux du groupe de comparaison. \u00c0 cela s'ajoute le fait que la collecte des donn\u00e9es avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 des \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes - 1986 dans le cas des postes CR et 1990-1991 dans le cas des emplois PO. Une telle diff\u00e9rence dans le temps est habituellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e inacceptable dans un exercice d'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[473] Postes Canada a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s parce que certains des sous-postes , comme le travail en rotation des PO-4, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus durant le processus d'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[474] Bien que l'\u00e9valuation des emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ne d\u00e9pendait pas des Feuilles de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, comme c'\u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre initialement le cas pour les \u00e9valuations CR, elle reposait en grande partie sur les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi \u00e9labor\u00e9es par la Commission. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, ces particularit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es \u00e0 partir d'une gamme de donn\u00e9es acquises gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de r\u00e9unions tenues avec le personnel de gestion de Postes Canada. Tout en \u00e9valuant pourquoi la Commission avait emprunt\u00e9 ce parcours particulier, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal montre que la majorit\u00e9 des experts en emploi ne consid\u00e8reraient pas cette m\u00e9thode de collecte de renseignements comme \u00e9tant une m\u00e9thode appropri\u00e9e. Selon Mme Pat Armstrong, un t\u00e9moin expert pour la Commission, les gestionnaires sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral trop loin du travail op\u00e9rationnel pour qu'ils puissent le conna\u00eetre suffisamment en profondeur lorsqu'il est question de faire une \u00e9valuation. Le contact avec les titulaires de poste individuel est la meilleure fa\u00e7on d'obtenir des renseignements. En fait, les profils d'emploi fournis par Postes Canada pour que la Commission puisse les utiliser dans l'\u00e9laboration de ses 10 particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi PO ont pos\u00e9 leur propre difficult\u00e9 parce qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tiquet\u00e9s \u00e9bauche et n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par les syndicats.\n[475] En raison de la nature inhabituelle des techniques de collecte de renseignement utilis\u00e9es par la Commission, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle disposait d'une surabondance de renseignements sur l'emploi concernant la collectivit\u00e9 PO. En plus des particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi , un certain nombre de descriptions d'emploi, de profils d'emploi et d'attributs relatifs au comportement \u00e9taient disponibles. L'\u00c9quipe a \u00e9galement eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 divers manuels, guides et autres documents de Postes Canada. Lorsque l'\u00c9quipe a effectu\u00e9 son travail d'\u00e9valuation en juin 2000, elle a eu acc\u00e8s aux nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et documents \u00e0 l'appui des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 abondamment quant aux fonctions et quant aux activit\u00e9s des travailleurs PO. Bien que l'examen fait par l'\u00c9quipe de l'ensemble de ces documents \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque a men\u00e9 \u00e0 peu de modifications dans ses \u00e9valuations initiales, il a servi \u00e0 confirmer les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi PO qu'elle poss\u00e9dait d\u00e9j\u00e0, m\u00eame si ce n'\u00e9tait que dans la configuration des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques .\n[476] Les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ne repr\u00e9sentent aucun des nombreux postes du sous-groupe superviseur PO. Cependant, les \u00e9chantillons des titulaires de poste CR comprennent un certain nombre de superviseurs au niveau CR-5. Cela soul\u00e8ve des questions de coh\u00e9rence et d'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 entre le groupe plaignant et le groupe de comparaison.\n[477] Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que les organigrammes et le Guide d'entrevue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des sources secondaires et tertiaires de donn\u00e9es sur les emplois CR. Des difficult\u00e9s avec ces deux instruments ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9es - des versions p\u00e9rim\u00e9es ou manquantes des organigrammes, le m\u00e9contentement de Postes Canada et de l'Alliance principalement quant au contenu et quant \u00e0 l'utilisation projet\u00e9e du Guide d'entrevue. En fait, M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Guide d'entrevue n'avait rien ajout\u00e9 de particulier \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension de l'\u00c9quipe quant aux fonctions de l'emploi des titulaires de poste CR.\n[478] Postes Canada et ses trois t\u00e9moins experts cl\u00e9s, dont les t\u00e9moignages principaux sont examin\u00e9s plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente section, ont critiqu\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de justification de la Commission. Leur pr\u00e9occupation avait trait \u00e0 l'utilisation par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de justification dans la pr\u00e9paration de sa principale liste de postes CR et d'emplois PO qu'elle \u00e9valuerait. La liste de l'\u00c9quipe a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur les pointages totaux, par ordre ascendant, attribu\u00e9s par la Commission. Ces pointages figuraient dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de justification. Les experts qui ont comparu devant le Tribunal pour Postes Canada ont estim\u00e9 que cela \u00e9tait inadmissible dans un processus d'\u00e9valuation et ont estim\u00e9 qu'une telle utilisation a pu ind\u00fbment influencer les pointages des \u00e9ventuelles \u00e9valuations.\n[479] Les entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques effectu\u00e9es avec les titulaires de poste CR avant que les \u00e9valuations ne soient entreprises par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle aux phases 1 et 2 \u00e9taient un exercice bien intentionn\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour am\u00e9liorer les connaissances de l'\u00c9quipe sur l'emploi. M. Wolf a reconnu que les entrevues avaient principalement mis l'accent sur les conditions de travail et, \u00e0 une ou deux exceptions pr\u00e8s, n'ont rien ajout\u00e9 d'important quant \u00e0 cet aspect. De plus, un pourcentage de 63 p. 100 d'entrevues achev\u00e9es lors de la phase 1 et de 57 p. 100 \u00e0 la phase 2, soul\u00e8ve des questions quant \u00e0 savoir si les postes d'un nombre important de titulaires qui n'ont pas particip\u00e9, pour quelques raisons que ce soit, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une certaine fa\u00e7on d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s. Compte tenu de l'importance de la coh\u00e9rence et de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, et m\u00eame de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de traitement, il y a probablement, par cons\u00e9quent, une certaine limite \u00e0 l'avantage apport\u00e9 par ces renseignements additionnels.\n[480] Le processus dont l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'est servie pour \u00e9valuer les emplois individuels \u00e9tait carr\u00e9ment sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui dont s'est servie la Commission pour faire ses \u00e9valuations en 1987 ou en 1991. L'\u00c9quipe a fonctionn\u00e9 comme une entit\u00e9, laquelle a pris conjointement ses d\u00e9cisions, soit \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9, soit par consensus. Il s'agit de la m\u00e9thode du comit\u00e9, laquelle est recommand\u00e9e par les experts en \u00e9valuation et laquelle suit le mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le livret de la Commission.\n[481] Le processus de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle comportait toutefois un certain nombre de lacunes. Par exemple, un seul des trois membres s'est rendu dans une installation de Postes Canada et \u00e9tait familier avec les op\u00e9rations postales. L'\u00c9quipe n'a \u00e9videmment pas re\u00e7u d'observations provenant des niveaux organisationnels pertinents de l'employeur. Compte tenu des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'\u00c9quipe fonctionnait comme un organisme ext\u00e9rieur embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 contrat, n'ayant aucun contact avec l'employeur et peu ou aucun contact avec ses employ\u00e9s. Elle poss\u00e9dait peu de r\u00e9troactions ou de connaissance directe de la nature, de l'historique et de la dynamique de l'organisme concern\u00e9, \u00e0 l'exception de ce que le troisi\u00e8me membre qui poss\u00e9dait une certaine exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 Postes Canada pouvait fournir.\n[482] La piste de v\u00e9rification de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s quant il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de retracer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment comment M. Wolf et ses coll\u00e8gues avaient utilis\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode Hay ainsi que la justification de leurs choix et de leurs pointages d'\u00e9valuation. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Wolf a admis que leur piste de v\u00e9rification ne refl\u00e9tait pas l'ensemble de leur raisonnement sur lequel reposaient les pointages. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait rudimentaire et ne donnait que les grandes lignes par opposition \u00e0 des d\u00e9tails . Il a poursuivi en admettant :\n[Traduction]\n[...] si vous laissez entendre que nous avons b\u00e2cl\u00e9 notre travail en ce qui concerne la consignation de la piste de v\u00e9rification, alors je dois l'admettre145.\n(v) La position de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle quant \u00e0 ses \u00e9valuations d'emplois de 1993 et de 1994 [483] M. Wolf a reconnu que lui et ses deux coll\u00e8gues avaient trouv\u00e9 de nombreuses lacunes dans les renseignements et les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi disponibles. En effet, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, il a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 qualifier d' abominable la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, laquelle \u00e9tait initialement cens\u00e9e \u00eatre la source premi\u00e8re d'obtention de renseignements \u00e0 jour sur les postes CR et les emplois PO.\n[484] En ce qui concerne la compr\u00e9hension des emplois que l'\u00c9quipe s'est faite \u00e0 partir des documents dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] Je dois dire que, \u00e0 l'exception de quatre emplois que nous n'avons pas examin\u00e9s, notre compr\u00e9hension \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quate mais pas n\u00e9cessairement id\u00e9ale146 [...]\n[485] Quelle est la signification du mot ad\u00e9quat ? Le Oxford Concise Dictionary d\u00e9finit le mot ad\u00e9quat comme signifiant [Traduction] suffisant, satisfaisant; \u00e0 peine suffisant . Le dictionnaire Webster d\u00e9finit le mot ad\u00e9quat comme [Traduction] suffisant pour ce qui est demand\u00e9; suffisant; convenable . Le dictionnaire Oxford d\u00e9finit le mot suffisant comme [Traduction] suffisant, ad\u00e9quat, suffisamment et le dictionnaire Webster le d\u00e9finit comme [Traduction] autant qu'il faut, suffisamment, ad\u00e9quat .\n[486] Suivant ces d\u00e9finitions, M. Wolf et son \u00c9quipe ont d\u00fb croire que les renseignements sur l'emploi dont ils \u00e9taient saisis \u00e9taient suffisants pour ce dont ils avaient besoin pour faire les \u00e9valuations des emplois. C'\u00e9tait suffisant.\n[487] En ce qui concerne la m\u00e9thode Hay et comment l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle l'a employ\u00e9e dans ses \u00e9valuations, M. Wolf a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit dans son t\u00e9moignage :\n[Traduction]\nQ. Comment est la norme en l'esp\u00e8ce par rapport aux normes commerciales?\nR. Comme je crois l'avoir mentionn\u00e9, nous avons adopt\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode plus rigoureuse ou plus exigeante que celle que nous adopterions normalement. Donc, elle rencontre certainement au moins, et selon moi surpasse probablement, la norme commerciale habituelle, c'est-\u00e0-dire ce que les experts de Hay ou d'autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'experts-conseils font pour leurs clients147.\n(vi) La position de Postes Canada quant aux \u00e9valuations des emplois de la Commission de 1991 et celles de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle de 1993 et 1994 [488] La position de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du travail de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle est claire. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que les renseignements et les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi n'\u00e9taient pas assez fiables pour prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9 sur le sexe au sens de l'article 11 de la Loi. Postes Canada pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que le syst\u00e8me Hay n'est pas appropri\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les \u00e9valuations en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale comportant des cols bleus et des employ\u00e9s de bureau et que le processus entrepris par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle comportait des lacunes.\n[489] \u00c0 l'appui de leur pr\u00e9tention, Postes Canada a fait t\u00e9moigner les trois t\u00e9moins experts suivants, class\u00e9s par ordre de comparution devant le Tribunal : les deux premiers t\u00e9moins ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant aux \u00e9valuations de la Commission de 1991 et des \u00e9valuations de l'\u00e9quipe professionnelle de 1993 et 1994 :\nMme Nadine Winter a comparu pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant le Tribunal en avril 1996 en tant que pr\u00e9sidente de N. Winter Consulting Inc., une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en \u00e9valuation des emplois, en recherche en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et en gestion de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Avant de cr\u00e9er sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en 1989, Mme Winter a travaill\u00e9 chez Hay Management Consultants Canada Ltd. entre 1982 et 1988. En tant que directrice des programmes \u00c9galit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'emploi, elle conseillait les experts-conseils de Hay ainsi que ses clients et elle s'est occup\u00e9e de la modification du syst\u00e8me Hay afin qu'il respecte les exigences en mati\u00e8re de non-sexisme. Parmi ses r\u00e9alisations, elle a mentionn\u00e9 la mise en uvre du syst\u00e8me Hay, dans un contexte de parit\u00e9 salariale , au sein du gouvernement du Manitoba. Elle est devenue associ\u00e9e chez Hay Canada en 1987 et a obtenu le titre de directrice des Pratiques d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e par le Tribunal d'expert en \u00e9valuation des emplois et en gestion de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, y compris expert en parit\u00e9 salariale et en salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. M. Norman D. Willis a comparu pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant le Tribunal en mai 1996. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la retraite depuis deux ans. Il a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re en \u00e9valuation des emplois chez Hay & Associates, aux Etats-Unis, en 1968. D\u00e8s 1971, il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en formation en gestion et en \u00e9tudes des ressources humaines. En 1974, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 son propre plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, lequel \u00e9tait semblable, sur le plan conceptuel, au syst\u00e8me Hay. Ce plan a \u00e9volu\u00e9 depuis en incorporant des modifications afin de rencontrer les exigences des clients. M. Willis s'est d'abord concentr\u00e9 sur les clients dans la r\u00e9gion de Seattle. Sa premi\u00e8re proposition d'\u00e9valuation des emplois au Canada a commenc\u00e9 par une pr\u00e9sentation sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale au gouvernement du Yukon en 1985. Par la suite, il s'est occup\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes en \u00e9valuation des emplois \u00e0 l'\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, en Alberta et au Manitoba. Willis & Associates a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 de l'Initiative conjointe syndicale-patronale (le Comit\u00e9 mixte). L'Initiative conjointe syndicale-patronale est une \u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale faite conjointement par le gouvernement canadien et les syndicats de la fonction publique afin d'aider le Comit\u00e9 dans son travail. \u00c9ventuellement, le Comit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'utiliser le plan d'\u00e9valuation Willis \u00e0 condition qu'il puisse \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour rencontrer les crit\u00e8res de la disposition habilitante, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ces modifications furent apport\u00e9es. M. Willis a plus tard comparu comme t\u00e9moin expert devant le tribunal du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor qui a entendu la plainte du syndicat, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 apr\u00e8s que l'\u00e9tude du Comit\u00e9 mixte eut \u00e9chou\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en parit\u00e9 salariale et en \u00e9valuation des emplois par le Tribunal. M. P.G. Wallace a comparu pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant le Tribunal en juin 2002. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait Premier vice-pr\u00e9sident de Aon Consulting Inc., un organisme qui offre des services d'expert-conseil sur la gestion des pratiques en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Il poss\u00e8de une tr\u00e8s grande exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois et de conception de programmes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration car il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'introduction du syst\u00e8me Hay \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al dans les ann\u00e9es 70. Il a \u00e9galement g\u00e9r\u00e9 le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay pour Shell Canada Ltd. et l'a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 avec Hay mondial pour le compte de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re, Royal Dutch Shell. Dans le cadre de sa pratique courante, il donne des conseils \u00e0 de nombreuses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la conception, la mise en uvre et la gestion de divers programmes d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 par le Tribunal d'expert en \u00e9valuation des emplois.\na) Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter [490] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le travail fait par la Commission en 1991 quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, Mme Winter est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 un certain nombre de conclusions, la principale \u00e9tant la suivante :\nen adoptant le plan Hay XYZ, la Commission a choisi une m\u00e9thode qui ne mesure pas, de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et compl\u00e8te, l'ensemble des aspects du travail que l'on retrouve dans les postes d'employ\u00e9 de bureau et dans les postes de cols bleus (tout en soulignant \u00e9galement que ni l'Alliance, ni Postes Canada, n'avait approuv\u00e9 l'utilisation du plan Hay); la majorit\u00e9 des postes CR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s par les \u00e9valuateurs, individuellement, et non pas par les \u00e9valuateurs r\u00e9unis en comit\u00e9; dans le cas des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , tous sauf un ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s par au moins deux \u00e9valuateurs, ce qui a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en un processus de pointage diff\u00e9rent quant aux postes CR et quant aux emplois PO; l'\u00e9valuateur de la Commission, lequel a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le plus grand nombre de postes CR, n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois; les \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission, dans l'ensemble, ne poss\u00e9daient pas une bonne connaissance des postes CR et des emplois PO; les outils de collecte de donn\u00e9es pour les postes CR et les emplois PO ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de recueillir des descriptions pr\u00e9cises, coh\u00e9rentes et compl\u00e8tes du travail en cause; plus particuli\u00e8rement, la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi n'a pas pu produire de renseignements pr\u00e9cis, coh\u00e9rent, et complets sur les postes; on a demand\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s CR d'\u00e9valuer leur propre poste plut\u00f4t que de fournir des renseignements pr\u00e9cis sur leur poste; les directives et les lignes directrices pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es aux r\u00e9pondants \u00e9taient insuffisantes et pr\u00eataient \u00e0 confusion; comme la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue pour cadrer avec System One, les renseignements non pertinents \u00e0 ce syst\u00e8me n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis; cela signifie que des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 des domaines comme les aptitudes aux relations humaines et les conditions de travail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus; le but poursuivi par le Guide d'entrevue n'\u00e9tait pas clair et apparemment aucun ensemble commun de lignes directrices et de d\u00e9finitions n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la disposition des intervieweurs afin de les aider; les m\u00eames lacunes relev\u00e9es dans la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi se retrouvaient dans le Guide d'entrevue; de nombreuses modifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la conception du Guide d'entrevue apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du processus d'entrevue; parfois, il y avait des incompatibilit\u00e9s ou des diff\u00e9rences dans les descriptions d'emploi, mais celles-ci n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clarifi\u00e9es par les entrevues; les renseignements recueillis sur les emplois PO \u00e9taient incomplets et ne refl\u00e9taient pas vraiment la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des postes; le caract\u00e8re unique et les diff\u00e9rences de chacun des postes n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus; les exigences quant \u00e0 la rotation des postes au niveau PO-4 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues; les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi en ce qui concerne le groupe PO \u00e9taient une compilation subjective faite par une personne, laquelle compilation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par les employ\u00e9s ou par une visite des lieux; rien n'indique que les postes-rep\u00e8res CR et PO de 1991 \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sentatifs de la gamme compl\u00e8te des postes vis\u00e9s; la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements des postes-rep\u00e8res laissait grandement \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer; comment les postes-rep\u00e8res ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour orienter l'\u00e9valuation d'autres postes ne semble pas clair, m\u00eame pour l'enqu\u00eateur principal, si on se fie au t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier; le groupe-\u00e9chantillon de 93 postes CR et de 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ne rend pas visible l'ensemble du travail de la population totale des CR et des PO; la Commission a peut-\u00eatre pu fausser le processus d'\u00e9valuation en \u00e9valuant au d\u00e9part les postes CR dans l'ordre selon lequel ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s, par niveau de classification CR; l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de justification de la Commission n'a pas fourni de motifs ad\u00e9quats pour expliquer et justifier les pointages; la Commission n'a pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, officiellement et syst\u00e9matiquement, la coh\u00e9rence et l'exactitude des \u00e9valuations; un bon nombre des examens officiels de r\u00e9capitulation qui font partie int\u00e9grale du syst\u00e8me Hay, ne semblent pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faits.\n[491] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme Winter a conclu que [Traduction] le processus de collecte de renseignements sur les postes comportait de graves lacunes [...] et que [Traduction] la Commission n'avait pas appliqu\u00e9 un processus rigoureux ou d\u00e9fendable pour \u00e9tablir la valeur des postes CR et des emplois PO qu'elle avait \u00e9valu\u00e9s148 .\n[492] Les principales conclusions tir\u00e9es par Mme Winter \u00e0 la suite de son examen du travail d'\u00e9valuation des emplois effectu\u00e9 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle sont les suivantes :\nelle a exprim\u00e9 la m\u00eame r\u00e9serve qu'elle avait exprim\u00e9 quant aux \u00e9valuations faites par la Commission en 1991 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'utilisation du plan Hay; elle a pr\u00e9tendu que ce plan ne tient pas compte, de fa\u00e7on exacte et compl\u00e8te, du travail que l'on retrouve dans les postes d'employ\u00e9 de bureau et dans les postes de cols bleus ; l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle n'a pas suivi l'application usuelle de la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay; elle s'est fi\u00e9e \u00e0 des comparaisons entre les emplois plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 des comparaisons des d\u00e9finitions poste-bar\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation; en commen\u00e7ant par classer les postes en fonction de leurs niveaux de classification et en fonction des pointages de la Commission, il y a une possibilit\u00e9 que l'\u00c9quipe ait pu fausser compl\u00e8tement le processus d'\u00e9valuation; un ensemble d'\u00e9valuations de postes rep\u00e8res repr\u00e9sentatif et coh\u00e9rent n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 au d\u00e9but du processus d'\u00e9valuation; les normes de description de l'emploi canadiennes et am\u00e9ricaines de Hay aux fins d'enqu\u00eates sur les salaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es dans les \u00e9valuations, ce qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me de coh\u00e9rence; les postes de la phase 1 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s comme postes rep\u00e8res officiels et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis comme postes rep\u00e8res d'une mani\u00e8re rigoureuse et syst\u00e9matique; un certain nombre de postes, poss\u00e9dant peu de caract\u00e9ristiques en commun avec les autres postes ou pour lesquels les documents \u00e0 l'appui \u00e9taient incomplets, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s comme postes rep\u00e8res; les trois \u00e9valuateurs manquaient d'exp\u00e9rience en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de postes de cols bleus et de postes d'employ\u00e9 de bureau avec la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay; les descriptions de poste comportaient de graves lacunes, principalement en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge, l'exactitude, le statut officiel et la connaissance des postes de la part des \u00e9valuateurs, laquelle connaissance \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e; l'\u00c9quipe n'a pas effectu\u00e9 un examen officiel, rigoureux de r\u00e9capitulation des r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation; de nombreux autres probl\u00e8mes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s, notamment le d\u00e9lai entre les \u00e9valuations de la phase 1 et de la phase 2, la piste de v\u00e9rification mal tenue et la d\u00e9finition erron\u00e9e du mot magnitude dans le facteur de l'imputabilit\u00e9.\n[493] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme Winter a conclu que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait d\u00e9rog\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante \u00e0 l'application usuelle de la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay et a accept\u00e9 des lacunes importantes dans la nature des postes. Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que [Traduction] la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les postes\/emplois CR et PO laissait trop \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer pour pouvoir faire des \u00e9valuations149 .\n[494] Mme Winter a \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9 une comparaison entre les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations des postes CR de la Commission (1991) et ceux de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle (1993). Les deux ensembles d'\u00e9valuateurs ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 les m\u00eames 93 postes CR avec essentiellement les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es et le m\u00eame plan Hay. Dans ces circonstances, Mme Winter a mentionn\u00e9 que les pointages respectifs devraient \u00eatre semblables. S'ils ne le sont pas, les r\u00e9sultats ne peuvent pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9s comme fiables.\n[495] Mme Winter a conclu que les hi\u00e9rarchies de valeur, refl\u00e9t\u00e9es dans les deux ensembles de r\u00e9sultats d'\u00e9valuation [Traduction] [...] [\u00e9taient] manifestement contradictoires. Compte tenu des contradictions dans les r\u00e9sultats, le Tribunal ne [pouvait] se fier sur ni l'un ni l'autre des pointages . Abstraction faite de la diff\u00e9rente discipline d'\u00e9valuation adopt\u00e9e par les deux groupes d'\u00e9valuateurs, elle croyait qu'il y avait trois explications quant au nombre et quant \u00e0 l'importance des contradictions entre les deux r\u00e9sultats. Premi\u00e8rement, la m\u00e9thode Hay n'est pas un outil appropri\u00e9 pour mesurer la valeur des postes CR et PO. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l'application de la m\u00e9thode Hay exige un ensemble coh\u00e9rent d'\u00e9valuations de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour orienter les \u00e9valuations ult\u00e9rieures. Aucun poste-rep\u00e8re n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s par la Commission ne convenaient pas. Troisi\u00e8mement, le manque de renseignements de qualit\u00e9 sur les postes a fait en sorte qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d'arriver \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats d'\u00e9valuation coh\u00e9rents et significatifs150.\nb) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Willis [496] M. Willis a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante la conclusion de son examen des \u00e9valuations faites par la Commission en 1991 :\n[Traduction]\nEn comparaison de l'approche disciplin\u00e9e exig\u00e9e par une \u00e9tude s\u00e9rieuse en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale, le travail de la CCDP a consist\u00e9 en un plan d'ensemble mal con\u00e7u et en un processus mis en application \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re en utilisant des donn\u00e9es qui ne pouvaient pas servir de fondement \u00e0 des \u00e9valuations acceptables. Il ne serait pas possible de d\u00e9pendre d'\u00e9valuations faites par ce groupe pour obtenir un r\u00e9sultat solide en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale151.\n[497] M. Willis a notamment conclu ce qui suit :\nla Commission a permis \u00e0 l'Alliance de faire une s\u00e9lection minutieuse des emplois du groupe de comparaison \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine en n'englobant pas dans son enqu\u00eate des postes qui n'\u00e9taient pas mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte; elle n'a pas tenu compte du groupe Manuvre et hommes de m\u00e9tier; le syst\u00e8me des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay utilis\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre satisfaisant comme instrument d'\u00e9valuation, \u00e0 condition que les \u00e9valuateurs eussent re\u00e7u une formation ad\u00e9quate; le facteur Conditions de travail, qui, apparemment a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 par Hay Canada, pr\u00e9voyait un large \u00e9ventail de points dans chaque niveau ou dans chaque sous-facteur, rendant ainsi tr\u00e8s difficile la r\u00e9alisation d'une \u00e9valuation coh\u00e9rente; des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrent qu'il y avait eu \u00e0 un certain nombre d'occasions, application erron\u00e9e du sous-facteur Aptitudes aux relations humaines; les \u00e9valuateurs ont rejet\u00e9 l'\u00e9tape du Profil (un moyen de v\u00e9rification des relations entre les facteurs) du processus d'\u00e9valuation parce que les \u00e9valuateurs [Traduction] avaient re\u00e7u certains profils qui \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t \u00e9tranges152 ; le libell\u00e9 des sous-facteurs Imputabilit\u00e9, Magnitude et Incidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on arbitraire par les \u00e9valuateurs durant les \u00e9valuations, ce qui a pu modifier les pointages et occasionner des incoh\u00e9rences; des \u00e9valuations de postes rep\u00e8res sont opportunes en l'esp\u00e8ce mais elles doivent \u00eatre repr\u00e9sentatives des emplois au sein du groupe total \u00e9valu\u00e9, tels qu'ils sont compris par les \u00e9valuateurs - cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la Commission; les postes rep\u00e8res auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es par l'ensemble du Comit\u00e9 et non pas par deux \u00e9valuateurs qui ont travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante; le processus de s\u00e9lection des \u00e9chantillons de poste\/emploi n'a pas du tout satisfait aux exigences rigoureuses en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9chantillonnage pr\u00e9vues dans le cadre d'un projet de parit\u00e9 salariale ; les postes \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s devraient repr\u00e9senter un \u00e9ventail complet de la profondeur et de l'ampleur de l'organisme; ce ne fut pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce; de plus, la diminution de l'\u00e9chantillon de 194 postes \u00e0 93 postes CR ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme valable ou objective; la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s \u00e9tait inacceptable et on ne pouvait s'attendre \u00e0 obtenir un r\u00e9sultat d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9quitable; [Traduction] [...] la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi \u00e9tait absolument insuffisante si l'on voulait faire une \u00e9valuation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale ; les descriptions d'emploi [Traduction] [...] \u00e9taient de peu d'utilit\u00e9 [...] \u00e0 l'appui de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi [...] ; [...] un Guide d'entrevue de 14 pages, incorpor\u00e9 dans les renseignements fournis aux \u00e9valuateurs \u00e9tait plus nuisible qu'utile [...] ; les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies \u00e0 deux \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes, 1986 pour les CR et 1990\/1991 pour les PO153; bien que les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi PO ont presque r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 fournir des renseignements concrets sur l'emploi, elles \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es fournies par la direction et non pas sur des donn\u00e9es fournies par les employ\u00e9s et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquises au moyen d'un processus tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent de celui utilis\u00e9 pour les CR; l'\u00e9tape de r\u00e9capitulation de la Commission n'\u00e9tait pas une \u00e9tape appropri\u00e9e - il devrait s'agir d'une comparaison bien structur\u00e9e, men\u00e9e par un groupe, des \u00e9valuations vis\u00e9es, sous-facteur par sous-facteur et niveau de pointage des facteurs par niveau de pointage des facteurs.\n[498] M. Willis a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit les conclusions de son examen des \u00e9valuations faites par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 1993\/1994 :\nl'\u00c9quipe [Traduction] [...] a mal utilis\u00e9 le plan d'\u00e9valuation Hay en s'en servant comme syst\u00e8me de comparaison de facteurs ; l'\u00c9quipe a essentiellement utilis\u00e9 les m\u00eames renseignements incomplets quant \u00e0 la nature du travail que ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s par les \u00e9valuateurs de la Commission; l'\u00c9quipe [Traduction] [...] ne disposait pas des outils n\u00e9cessaires pour s'acquitter avec succ\u00e8s de sa t\u00e2che en raison de son manque de connaissances et de son manque de contexte pour entreprendre la t\u00e2che ainsi qu'en raison d'une m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation qui manquait de rigueur. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation utilis\u00e9 \u00e9tait inacceptable compte tenu de ce qui est exig\u00e9 pour la r\u00e9alisation d'une \u00e9tude r\u00e9ussie en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale154 .\n[499] M. Willis a conclu en affirmant ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00c0 mon avis, le travail effectu\u00e9 par les experts-conseils dont les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus par l'AFPC ne peut pas servir de fondement \u00e0 l'obtention de r\u00e9sultats justes quant \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale 155.\n[500] M. Willis a conclu plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui suit :\nil a exprim\u00e9 des doutes quant \u00e0 la sagesse d'utiliser la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs du plan Hay dans une affaire de parit\u00e9 salariale et il a accord\u00e9 la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de points de la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay quant \u00e0 la mesure de la valeur de l'emploi; cette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son opinion que la m\u00e9thode de points convient davantage \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation d'une vaste gamme de postes dans un contexte de parit\u00e9 salariale ; de plus, il \u00e9tait d'avis que la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs est plus acceptable dans le contexte traditionnel d'un groupe professionnel d'emplois uniques; l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle disposait des m\u00eames renseignements incomplets sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s par la Commission, c'est-\u00e0-dire la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, le Guide d'entrevue, la description d'emploi et les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi ; il manquait des descriptions de poste CR et les descriptions des emplois PO \u00e9taient non officielles ; il a souscrit \u00e0 l'opinion de M. Wolf que les entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques men\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, [Traduction] [... ] \u00e0 une ou deux exceptions pr\u00e8s, en dehors du domaine des conditions de travail, [...] n'ont rien ajout\u00e9 d'important156 ; les trois membres de l'\u00c9quipe disposaient de renseignements sur le niveau de classification de chacun des postes et ces renseignements auraient pu avoir une incidence sur leur perception quant aux postes et, par cons\u00e9quent, sur leurs \u00e9valuations; on ne pouvait s'attendre \u00e0 ce que l'application de la m\u00e9thode de la bo\u00eete noire \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois permette d'en arriver \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation utile de ce qui \u00e9tait compris \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la bo\u00eete noire, compte tenu de la pi\u00e8tre qualit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi; il s'agissait d'une pratique tr\u00e8s discutable que d'utiliser la norme Hay am\u00e9ricaine quant \u00e0 la description d'emploi, notamment dans une affaire de parit\u00e9 salariale , car cette norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue pour des comparaisons d'\u00e9tudes et on ne saurait pr\u00e9sumer que les titres d'emploi am\u00e9ricains et canadiens, m\u00eame s'ils sont les m\u00eames ou m\u00eame s'ils se ressemblent, sont semblables quant \u00e0 la nature du travail.\nc) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Wallace [501] M. Wallace a mentionn\u00e9 que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait fait demander par Postes Canada d'examiner et de formuler des observations quant au processus entrepris par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 2000 dans son appr\u00e9ciation de l'incidence possible sur ses \u00e9valuations de 1993\/1994 des nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s par un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada. M. Wallace a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait utilis\u00e9 ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 [Traduction] [...] des crit\u00e8res standards par rapport auxquels les exercices d'\u00e9valuation des emplois au sein des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sont mesur\u00e9s 157. Ce qu'il voulait savoir, c'\u00e9tait si les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois de l'\u00c9quipe \u00e9taient justes, coh\u00e9rents et cr\u00e9dibles.\n[502] M. Wallace a de plus mentionn\u00e9 que [Traduction] l'objectif vis\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sent examen est d'\u00e9tablir si oui ou non le processus et la rigueur employ\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 (l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle) permettait de produire des r\u00e9sultats qui satisfont \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res158 .\n[503] Parmi les principales conclusions tir\u00e9es par M. Wallace, on retrouve notamment les conclusions suivantes :\nles processus suivis et les actions prises par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 la hauteur d'un bon nombre de ce qu'il estimait \u00eatre des pratiques courantes de l'industrie quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, ce qui a eu pour effet de compromettre de fa\u00e7on importante l'exactitude, la coh\u00e9rence et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats; [Traduction] l'absence de documents complets et coh\u00e9rents sur ce qui est mesur\u00e9 par le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois [...] et le d\u00e9faut du Comit\u00e9 (l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle) d'appliquer les mesures de protection du syst\u00e8me Hay, ont une incidence directe sur la coh\u00e9rence des r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation159 ; le manque de rigueur et de discipline dans le processus de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle devrait mettre en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation.\n[504] M. Wallace a notamment conclu ce qui suit :\nla m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay, bien qu'elle soit un excellent outil d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, ne convenait pas aux emplois de bureau et aux emplois li\u00e9s \u00e0 la production et (ou) \u00e0 l'exploitation; la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs Hay ne date pas d'hier et elle ne cadre pas avec le mat\u00e9riel didactique Hay ou avec les 30 ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience de M. Wallace avec la m\u00e9thode Hay; la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs convient mieux aux emplois qui sont de nature semblable; [Traduction] il est difficile, voire impossible, de cr\u00e9er un classement pr\u00e9cis d'emplois diff\u00e9rents en se fiant totalement \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs sans lier les \u00e9valuations aux bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation160 ; l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, bien que comprenant des experts reconnus dans l'utilisation de la m\u00e9thode Hay, avait peu d'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'op\u00e9rations postales; le risque de partialit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9, compte tenu que l'\u00c9quipe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de l'affaire par deux des parties en l'esp\u00e8ce; bien que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle se soit r\u00e9unie pendant cinq jours pour d\u00e9battre de la question de l'incidence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires sur ses \u00e9valuations initiales, le processus suivi ne semblait aucunement structur\u00e9; M. Wolf n'avait avec lui aucune note provenant de son examen des documents, ni aucun r\u00e9sum\u00e9, ni aucune analyse des donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi que l'\u00c9quipe avait examin\u00e9es; le tri initial des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9 par un membre unique de l'\u00e9quipe, M. Wolf, soul\u00e8ve des questions, en raison tout particuli\u00e8rement de l'absence de documents concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9s non pertinents ou inopportuns; il n'y a non plus aucun document concernant les t\u00e9moignages additionnels s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s; les descriptions d'emploi \u00e9taient incompl\u00e8tes et contradictoires et les renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires fournis n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9s et document\u00e9s correctement; il est essentiel qu'un groupe d'\u00e9valuation soit tout \u00e0 fait convaincu de ses descriptions d'emploi; M. Wallace n'a pas souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle [Traduction] [...] de n'\u00e9valuer les emplois PO que si elle jugeait qu'il y avait une diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 peine perceptible entre le souvenir qu'elle avait de sa compr\u00e9hension initiale des emplois et de sa nouvelle compr\u00e9hension des emplois161 ; l'\u00c9quipe aurait d\u00fb motiver son jugement quant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 peine perceptible en utilisant les bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay et aurait d\u00fb r\u00e9\u00e9valuer chaque emploi en incorporant l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es additionnelles; la faiblesse de la piste de v\u00e9rification du processus d'\u00e9valuation 1993\/1994 a compromis le processus de 2000 car il n'y avait aucun dossier d'\u00e9valuations solides faites dans la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure, lesquelles \u00e9valuations auraient pu servir de postes rep\u00e8res pour les \u00e9valuations de 2000, et car il n'y avait aucun dossier concernant des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures controvers\u00e9es qui auraient pu \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n(vii) La position de l'Alliance quant au : a) T\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter [505] Dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, l'Alliance a mis l'accent sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui concernent Mme Winter et son t\u00e9moignage. Ces trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont les suivants :\nsa familiarit\u00e9 avec la m\u00e9thode Hay et avec le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay ; sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9; ses rapports (Pi\u00e8ces R-235, R-249, R-253 et R-278).\n[506] L'Alliance pr\u00e9tend que, en tant que pierre angulaire de l'offensive de Postes Canada contre l'enqu\u00eate et les \u00e9valuations de la Commission ainsi que contre les \u00e9valuations de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences que l'on a \u00e0 l'endroit d'un t\u00e9moin expert et il \u00e9tait si peu cr\u00e9dible qu'on devrait ne lui accorder aucun poids.\n[507] Mme Winter s'est jointe \u00e0 Hay en 1982 et a commenc\u00e9 un stage comme expert-conseil en \u00e9valuation des emplois en 1985. Ce n'est qu'au d\u00e9but de 1986 qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant un expert-conseil \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re en \u00e9valuation Hay. Elle a travaill\u00e9 dans le domaine de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois pendant environ deux ans et demi tout en assumant d'autres responsabilit\u00e9s chez Hay, lesquelles responsabilit\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Postes Canada n'a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualifier d'expert en syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay.\n[508] L'Alliance renvoie au fait que Mme Winter, alors qu'elle travaillait toujours pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Hay Canada, avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une poursuite intent\u00e9e par Hay contre Norman Willis pour ce qu'elle avait appel\u00e9 une violation des lois en mati\u00e8re du droit de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 . Lors de son t\u00e9moignage sur cette question, Mme Winter a donn\u00e9 de nombreux renseignements inexacts et a apport\u00e9 de nombreuses rectifications. L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que cela s'\u00e9tait produit parce qu'elle d\u00e9sirait \u00e9viter de reconna\u00eetre les fortes et \u00e9videntes similitudes entre les plans d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Willis et Hay. Compte tenu que le plan Willis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9, avec succ\u00e8s, dans de nombreuses applications en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale , notamment dans des cas de travail de bureau et de travail de cols bleus , l'Alliance a fait valoir que Mme Winter tentait d'induire le Tribunal en erreur \u00e0 propos de ces similarit\u00e9s.\n[509] L'Alliance a mis davantage en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Winter en renvoyant au fait qu'elle avait omis de renvoyer le Tribunal \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du tribunal laquelle faisait suite au travail du Comit\u00e9 mixte (la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), et laquelle contredisait son opinion concernant la norme de fiabilit\u00e9 exig\u00e9e quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi162. Elle avait demand\u00e9 que l'on applique la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, comme l'exigeait son interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision ontarienne Haldimand-Norfolk163; la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que, lorsqu'on l'a contre-interrog\u00e9 sur ce point, elle ne savait pas ce que caract\u00e8re raisonnable signifiait dans le contexte des \u00e9valuations en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[510] L'Alliance a mentionn\u00e9 les autres exemples suivants quant au manque de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Winter :\nelle a omis des \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s lorsqu'elle a donn\u00e9 son opinion concernant la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur l'emploi; elle a eu tendance \u00e0 faire ressortir le n\u00e9gatif et \u00e0 ignorer le positif lorsqu'elle a fait part de ses opinions, et ce, plut\u00f4t que de r\u00e9pondre directement aux questions; les r\u00e9ponses qu'elle a donn\u00e9es aux questions pos\u00e9es ressemblaient souvent \u00e0 des argumentations plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 des r\u00e9ponses ; au fur et \u00e0 mesure que se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s les jours de son t\u00e9moignage, il est devenu \u00e9vident qu'elle \u00e9tait de plus en plus port\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier avec beaucoup d'ampleur des points qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s la journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n[511] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que, pris dans son ensemble, le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de Mme Winter a fait preuve de partialit\u00e9 envers la position de l'intim\u00e9e et n'a pas du tout satisfait aux normes exig\u00e9es de la part d'un t\u00e9moin expert cr\u00e9dible, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon l'Alliance, on ne devrait accorder aucun poids au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter.\n[512] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les pr\u00e9tentions de l'Alliance concernant le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de Mme Winter ont mis l'accent sur son opinion concernant les outils de collecte de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, le processus de renseignements sur le poste, la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur le poste et le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. Cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix ainsi qu'aux chapitres 4 et 6 de ses rapports (Pi\u00e8ces R-235 et R-249).\n[513] Dans son rapport, Mme Winter a pr\u00e9tendu que la [Traduction] qualit\u00e9 des renseignements quant aux postes CR et PO ne permettait pas de faire une \u00e9valuation ad\u00e9quate164 . Elle a illustr\u00e9 son point de vue en examinant deux postes CR qui avaient servi de postes rep\u00e8res. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des documents pertinents concernant ces postes, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre ce en quoi consistaient les postes. Un poste en particulier lui a donn\u00e9 beaucoup de difficult\u00e9. Lors du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Winter, l'Alliance a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le superviseur comp\u00e9tent pour ce poste avait recens\u00e9 un autre poste qui \u00e9tait essentiellement identique. Mme Winter avait utilis\u00e9, comme exemple de poste rep\u00e8re pour lequel la documentation \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point mauvaise qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de comprendre de quoi il s'agissait, le poste rep\u00e8re qui avait servi de point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au poste presque identique. Mme Winter avait toutefois omis de renvoyer \u00e0 ce poste presque identique. L'e\u00fbt-t-elle fait, elle aurait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 sa compr\u00e9hension de ce qu'elle avait estim\u00e9 \u00eatre un poste de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence difficile; l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a imm\u00e9diatement reconnu le chevauchement entre les deux postes.\n[514] Selon l'Alliance, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter, en contre-interrogatoire, concernant son poste de copr\u00e9sidente du processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale du Manitoba, a illustr\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 d'int\u00e9grer des renseignements qui se trouvaient dans les diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9ponses des titulaires d'emploi afin d'obtenir une compr\u00e9hension acceptable des emplois. Cette capacit\u00e9 contraste fortement, selon l'Alliance, avec l'approche de Mme Winter quant \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension des emplois dans la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi. Elle a souvent exprim\u00e9 ses opinions isol\u00e9ment et a fait peu d'efforts pour int\u00e9grer les renseignements qui lui \u00e9taient disponibles dans diverses sources.\n[515] L'Alliance a cit\u00e9 d'autres exemples d'opinions cat\u00e9goriques ou exag\u00e9r\u00e9es qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans ses rapports et en interrogatoire principal et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mitig\u00e9es en contre-interrogatoire.\n[516] Malgr\u00e9 les modifications et les explications qu'elle avait apport\u00e9es durant le contre-interrogatoire, Mme Winter a maintenu les conclusions dont elle avait fait part. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les r\u00e9sultats d'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle [Traduction] ne peuvent pas \u00eatre jug\u00e9s fiables, pr\u00e9cis ou refl\u00e9tant le travail effectu\u00e9165 parce que les renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s comportaient de graves lacunes et que le processus d'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, s'\u00e9cartait beaucoup de l'application standard du syst\u00e8me Hay tel qu'elle le comprenait.\n[517] Cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le refus de Mme Winter de reconna\u00eetre que la m\u00e9thode Hay pouvait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on fiable au moyen d'une m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs comme celle utilis\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que cette opinion devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e par le Tribunal si on se fie \u00e0 l'opinion contraire mais plus cr\u00e9dible de M. Martin Wolf, le seul t\u00e9moin \u00e0 \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'expert dans l'utilisation du plan Hay. Le fait que Mme Winter n'ait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 les postes CR ou les postes PO, en utilisant un quelconque plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, a fait ressortir la nature th\u00e9orique de son opinion. Fond\u00e9e, comme elle l'\u00e9tait, sur une th\u00e9orie qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e durant son contre-interrogatoire, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que l'opinion de Mme Winter concernant la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs appliqu\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans le cadre du plan d'\u00e9valuation Hay devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[518] Dans la partie de son rapport (R-254) concernant les m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires que la Commission et l'Alliance avaient utilis\u00e9es, Mme Winter a insist\u00e9 sur sa croyance que l'identification du sexe, l'\u00e9valuation du travail et tout rajustement des salaires devraient se faire au niveau des emplois eux-m\u00eame plut\u00f4t qu'au niveau plus large du groupe et niveau o\u00f9 les emplois se situent. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a admis que, dans la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, le tribunal avait adopt\u00e9 l'identification du sexe au niveau du groupe plut\u00f4t qu'au niveau de l'emploi individuel.\n[519] Mme Winter a invoqu\u00e9 des dispositions particuli\u00e8res de diverses lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale mais elle a \u00e0 peine invoqu\u00e9 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Elle n'a \u00e9galement pas trait\u00e9 des articles 12 et 13 de l'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale bien qu'elle e\u00fbt critiqu\u00e9 la Commission et l'Alliance pour s'\u00eatre conform\u00e9es \u00e0 ces articles de l'ordonnance.\n[520] La m\u00e9thode de la Commission et de l'Alliance, laquelle consistait \u00e0 calculer un pointage moyen Hay pour chaque niveau CR et \u00e0 calculer un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9num\u00e9ration fond\u00e9 sur cette valeur moyenne, comportait, selon Mme Winter, de graves lacunes. Cette m\u00e9thode a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e ailleurs, notamment dans la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor.\n[521] Mme Winter a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que chaque poste CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9. Elle n'a pas modifi\u00e9 son opinion lorsque, en contre-interrogatoire, on lui a fait remarquer que le tribunal dans la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor avait approuv\u00e9 un \u00e9chantillonnage de la population CR.\n[522] Mme Winter a critiqu\u00e9 la composition du groupe de comparaison \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, lequel comprenait des sous-groupes PO-INT et PO-EXT. Elle a notamment invoqu\u00e9 la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale de l'Ontario et son exigence quant \u00e0 la recherche d'un groupe de comparaison au sein du groupe plaignant166. Elle a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres comp\u00e9tences provinciales qui exigent la n\u00e9gociation de groupes de comparaison. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a admis que ces prescriptions provinciales n'existent pas dans la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[523] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devait tirer une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative du rapport de Mme Winter parce qu'elle n'avait pas trait\u00e9 de la pertinence des d\u00e9cisions de tribunaux f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, de la Loi ainsi que de son ordonnance, lesquelles n'\u00e9tayent pas sa version de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Ses opinions \u00e9taient presque uniquement fond\u00e9es sur des parties de lois provinciales167.\n[524] Mme Winter est retourn\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9senter la pi\u00e8ce justificative R-278, un rapport qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 traiter des r\u00e9percussions des nouveaux renseignements sur les postes CR. Sa conclusion dans ce rapport \u00e9tait une r\u00e9it\u00e9ration de son opinion que les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9es par l'ensemble des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e9taient incompl\u00e8tes. Dans son argument, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que Mme Winter avait simplement utilis\u00e9 ce nouveau rapport comme pr\u00e9texte pour revoir ses critiques ant\u00e9rieures alors qu'elle continuait d'agir comme porte-parole pour l'intim\u00e9e.\nb) T\u00e9moignage de M. Willis [525] Les observations de l'Alliance portent en grande partie sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments ayant trait \u00e0 M. Willis ainsi qu'\u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. Ces observations sont les suivantes :\nsa connaissance de la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay; sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9; ses critiques, telles qu'exprim\u00e9es dans son rapport, quant au processus de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre du processus, quant \u00e0 l'approche de l'\u00c9quipe envers Hay (Pi\u00e8ce R-455).\n[526] Bien qu'il fut qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en \u00e9valuation des emplois et en parit\u00e9 salariale par le Tribunal, M. Willis n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert quant \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay. Il ne poss\u00e9dait que trois ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience directe quant \u00e0 l'application de cette m\u00e9thode, exp\u00e9rience qu'il avait acquise alors qu'il travaillait chez Hay entre 1968 et 1971. Il a conserv\u00e9 des liens avec un certain nombre d'installations Hay apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part.\n[527] L'Alliance a mis en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Willis. Son argument reposait sur une d\u00e9claration faite par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal (lequel a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9) lors d'une comparution ant\u00e9rieure de M. Willis. Le pr\u00e9sident avait, \u00e0 cette occasion, exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 l'opinion d'expert de M. Willis, compte tenu que celui-ci n'avait pas examin\u00e9 les \u00e9valuations pertinentes et les documents \u00e0 l'appui avant de donner son opinion.\n[528] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que le rapport de M. Willis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on similaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire sans le fondement appropri\u00e9 pour que l'on puisse le qualifier d'opinion d'expert. M. Willis a admis, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur son rapport, pi\u00e8ce R-455, qu'il n'avait pas lu l'ensemble des documents qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e. On lui avait toutefois demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer une opinion d'expert sur ces documents. Malgr\u00e9 cet aveu, son rapport ainsi que son t\u00e9moignage concernant ce rapport, ne mentionnaient pas que ses opinions \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur un examen partiel des documents envoy\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que son opinion ne devait pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant tout \u00e0 fait cr\u00e9dible.\n[529] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un certain nombre d'occasions, M. Willis, en interrogation principale, [Traduction] a insist\u00e9 avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence qu'il croyait que les d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Wolf en t\u00e9moignage sous serment \u00e9taient fausses . De tels expos\u00e9s d'opinion, selon l'Alliance, [Traduction] soul\u00e8vent des doutes importants quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Willis en tant que t\u00e9moin expert objectif et professionnel168 .\n[530] Le fait de ne pas avoir voulu faire la moindre petite concession quant au contre-interrogatoire de l'avocat a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 comme exemple de t\u00e9moin expert qui fait preuve d'intransigeance et qui d\u00e9fend sa position. En d'autres mots, les opinions d'expert de M. Willis devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es en tant qu'opinions d'une personne qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'attitude ind\u00e9pendante, professionnelle, demand\u00e9 de la part d'un t\u00e9moin expert cr\u00e9dible.\n[531] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement contest\u00e9 les opinions de M. Willis en raison de son manque d'exp\u00e9rience quant \u00e0 un processus de parit\u00e9 salariale qui se d\u00e9roulait dans une atmosph\u00e8re de litige plut\u00f4t que dans une atmosph\u00e8re de coop\u00e9ration patronale-syndicale. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, c'est dans ce dernier type de travail que M. Willis poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale , c'est-\u00e0-dire un travail dans lequel il avait agit \u00e0 titre de n\u00e9gociateur disposant de l'appui entier de la direction de l'employeur quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation des \u00e9tudes sur l'\u00e9valuation des emplois et quant \u00e0 la collecte de renseignements sur l'emploi \u00e0 partir desquels ces \u00e9valuations seraient faites. Selon l'Alliance, soit qu'il \u00e9tait incapable, soit qu'il refusait de comprendre la nature et le contexte de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. En effet, M. Willis a fait une concession durant le contre-interrogatoire. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que le processus qu'il avait pr\u00e9conis\u00e9 dans son rapport et durant son t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal, serait impossible, sauf pour le choix du plan d'\u00e9valuation, sans l'enti\u00e8re coop\u00e9ration de l'employeur.\n[532] S'appuyant sur cette concession, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que l'acceptation du rapport et du t\u00e9moignage de M. Willis \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 placer la norme n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 une pr\u00e9sentation r\u00e9ussie d'une preuve prima facie par un plaignant dans une plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00e0 un niveau si \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu'un refus par l'employeur de coop\u00e9rer se solderait toujours par un avortement de la plainte.\nc) T\u00e9moignage de M. Wallace [533] Les observations de l'Alliance portaient en grande partie sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui avaient trait \u00e0 M. Wallace ainsi qu'\u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. Ces observations portaient sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nsa connaissance de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois Hay; sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9; son rapport (Pi\u00e8ce R-615).\n[534] Bien qu'il fut qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en \u00e9valuation des emplois par le Tribunal, M. Wallace n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en \u00e9valuation des emplois Hay. Il poss\u00e9dait toutefois une exp\u00e9rience consid\u00e9rable avec l'utilisation de la m\u00e9thode Hay comme client travaillant sous la direction d'un expert-conseil de Hay. Il n'a jamais travaill\u00e9 pour Hay \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit, il n'a jamais non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert quant \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode Hay devant le Tribunal ou devant tout autre tribunal ou toute autre cour de justice.\n[535] Selon l'Alliance, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Wallace a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute lorsqu'il a critiqu\u00e9 la compr\u00e9hension de l'emploi qu'avaient M. Wolf et ses coll\u00e8gues, alors qu'ils n'avaient examin\u00e9 qu'une fraction des documents lus, analys\u00e9s et \u00e9valu\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. M. Wallace a admis qu'on ne lui avait pas fourni et qu'il n'avait pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir certains documents originaux sur l'emploi dont disposait l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. En fait, M. Wallace a conc\u00e9d\u00e9, en contre-interrogatoire, que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle poss\u00e9dait une meilleure connaissance que lui des emplois vis\u00e9s.\n[536] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que M. Wallace avait eu tendance \u00e0 souligner les aspects n\u00e9gatifs et \u00e0 ignorer les aspects positifs des rapports de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et du t\u00e9moignage de M. Wolf.\n[537] Le rapport de M. Wallace doit, selon les pr\u00e9tentions de l'Alliance, \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son contexte. Ce contexte est qu'il n'avait pas eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 bon nombre des documents sur lesquels l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e pour faire ses \u00e9valuations.\n[538] Son rapport est une critique de la m\u00e9thodologie, du processus et des renseignements sur l'emploi que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre de ses \u00e9valuations. Il souligne que les \u00e9valuations des emplois, notamment aux fins de parit\u00e9 salariale , doivent \u00eatre faites selon la norme utilis\u00e9e dans l'industrie. C'est la m\u00e9thode habituelle de M. Wallace. Cela fait tout simplement ressortir sa familiarit\u00e9 avec les \u00e9tudes appuy\u00e9es par l'employeur ainsi que son manque de familiarit\u00e9 avec un processus qui se d\u00e9roule dans un contexte litigieux.\n[539] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que [Traduction] la critique la plus importante que M. Wallace a adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plan Hay figurait dans ses explications figurant \u00e0 l'annexe A de son rapport, lesquelles explications montraient une faible corr\u00e9lation entre les points Hay et les sommes d'argent pay\u00e9es aux CR . M. Wallace a admis, en contre-interrogatoire, qu'il n'avait pas examin\u00e9 si cet \u00e9cart de r\u00e9num\u00e9ration pour les femmes qui font un travail qui semblait de valeur \u00e9gale \u00e0 celui des hommes a pu \u00eatre occasionn\u00e9e par un probl\u00e8me de parit\u00e9 salariale 169.\n[540] Selon l'Alliance, les critiques de M. Wallace \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus suivi par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, en comparaison du processus qu'il avait propos\u00e9, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une diff\u00e9rence essentielle dans l'approche. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a entrepris son processus de 2000 en pr\u00e9sumant que ses \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures \u00e9taient justes et qu'elle ne les modifierait que si les nouveaux documents venaient modifier sa compr\u00e9hension ant\u00e9rieure de chaque poste. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois propos\u00e9 par M. Wallace \u00e9tait un processus d'appel, interne, et non litigieux. Il ne s'agit pas du processus exig\u00e9 par les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[541] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu ce qui suit quant au t\u00e9moignage de M. Wallace :\nLe rapport de M. Wallace ainsi que son t\u00e9moignage doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s en fonction du fait reconnu qu'il n'a pas eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 bon nombre des documents lus, analys\u00e9s et \u00e9valu\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle; M. Wallace n'a pas tenu compte de la diff\u00e9rence fondamentale entre la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, une plainte qui \u00e9tait litigieuse presque depuis le d\u00e9but, et le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'employeur avec lequel il \u00e9tait familier; M. Wallace a reconnu que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle poss\u00e9dait une meilleure connaissance des emplois et des postes \u00e9valu\u00e9s que lui au moment o\u00f9 il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son rapport et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage.\n(viii) La position de la Commission quant aux t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada - Mme Winter, M. Willis et M. Wallace [542] Premi\u00e8rement, la Commission a soulign\u00e9 qu'aucun des trois experts pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Postes Canada n'avait vraiment travaill\u00e9 avec l'une ou l'autre des donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi qu'ils avaient jug\u00e9es inacceptables. Deuxi\u00e8mement, leurs opinions \u00e9taient toutes fond\u00e9es sur des renseignements incomplets. Soit que les documents qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Postes Canada \u00e9taient incomplets, soit que les t\u00e9moins n'avaient pas lu tous les documents qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme fondement du rapport de l'expert demand\u00e9.\n[543] Seule l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des renseignements sur l'emploi, notamment ceux mentionn\u00e9s par Postes Canada dans sa d\u00e9fense. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que les deux lacunes soulign\u00e9es suffisent pour que le Tribunal \u00e9carte le t\u00e9moignage des trois experts pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Postes Canada pour faire rapport sur le processus d'\u00e9valuation, la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation choisie et les renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s.\n[544] La Commission a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention que le rapport de Mme Winter \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 tort sur la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte plut\u00f4t que sur la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable pour critiquer la collecte des donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et les renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle durant son processus d'\u00e9valuation. Dans son rapport, Mme Winter avait soulign\u00e9 que le tribunal ontarien qui avait entendu la cause en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale dans la plainte impliquant un h\u00f4pital de Haldimand-Norfolk avait conclu dans sa d\u00e9cision que la norme \u00e0 appliquer \u00e9tait celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Mme Winter avait mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix :\nQ. [...] donne \u00e0 penser que la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e par le tribunal ontarien qui a entendu la cause Haldimand-Norfolk en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, [...] Je conclus que vous adoptez cette norme ou que vous avez adopt\u00e9 cette norme dans votre rapport?\nR. De la d\u00e9cision correcte, oui170.\n[545] En effet, Mme Winter a poursuivi en affirmant qu'elle ne savait pas ce que l'on voulait dire par d\u00e9cision raisonnable .\n[546] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que ce recours \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte comme fondement de l'opinion d'expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans son rapport et dans son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre la raison pour laquelle le Tribunal devrait ne pas tenir compte de son t\u00e9moignage. Ce recours \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte est tout simplement, selon la Commission, une illustration de la tendance de Mme Winter \u00e0 d\u00e9finir de mani\u00e8re rigide les principes de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Sa rigidit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e, de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative, par la Cour de l'Ontario (Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) dans la cause Service Employees International Union, dans laquelle la Cour a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de Mme Pat Armstrong \u00e0 celui de Mme Winter171.\n[547] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que des principes rigides sont incompatibles avec la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. En effet, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que Mme Winter elle-m\u00eame n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 la norme plus exigeante de la d\u00e9cision correcte aux renseignements sur l'emploi disponibles dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude manitobaine en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale dont elle \u00e9tait conjointement responsable lorsqu'elle travaillait chez Hay. En fait, elle a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, dans ce cas, de [Traduction] travailler avec les renseignements sur l'emploi du Manitoba. Cette attitude est analogue au t\u00e9moignage de M. Wolf que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a d\u00fb [Traduction] travailler avec les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi dont elle disposait.\n[548] L'aveu de Mme Winter de l'utilisation d'une approche moins rigide aux renseignements sur l'emploi durant son travail dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude manitobaine sur la parit\u00e9 salariale contraste vivement avec sa critique incessante de la plus grande partie, voire de la totalit\u00e9, des documents sur l'emploi en l'esp\u00e8ce et avec sa condamnation de l'approche adopt\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle envers les documents sur l'emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que Mme Winter manque de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 comme expert donnant son opinion concernant les renseignements sur l'emploi sur lesquels l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a fond\u00e9 son processus d'\u00e9valuation.\n[549] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'on devrait \u00e9galement accorder moins de poids \u00e0 l'opinion d'expert de M. Willis quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi, la m\u00e9thode et le processus d'\u00e9valuation, qu'\u00e0 l'opinion d'expert de M. Wolf. Elle fonde cette observation sur la mention qu'elle a faite au tribunal que M. Willis n'avait pas fait preuve de clart\u00e9, qu'il avait m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 ambigu et \u00e9vasif, quant \u00e0 savoir combien de temps il avait pris pour examiner les documents sur l'emploi qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Postes Canada pour qu'il s'en serve comme fondement de son opinion d'expert.\n[550] De plus, l'exp\u00e9rience de M. Willis quant aux processus d'\u00e9valuation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e9tait en grande partie fond\u00e9e sur des \u00e9tudes conjointes dans lesquelles les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produites avec l'assentiment de l'ensemble des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Bien qu'il fut qualifi\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert dans la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor en raison du fait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 animateur dans l'\u00e9tude dans laquelle on avait utilis\u00e9 son plan Willis comme fondement du processus, cette plainte avait principalement trait \u00e0 la question de la fiabilit\u00e9 de la m\u00e9thode choisie pour le traitement de l'\u00e9tude en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale du Comit\u00e9 mixte syndical-patronal et du processus d'\u00e9valuation.\n[551] Selon la Commission, l'opinion critique de M. Wallace quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi devrait \u00eatre en grande partie ignor\u00e9e parce qu'il n'a pas examin\u00e9 la plupart des documents sur l'emploi et que Postes Canada ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 non plus de les examiner. Son examen s'est en grande partie limit\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen de l'\u00e9tude faite par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, en 2000, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels fournis par les nombreux t\u00e9moins de la d\u00e9fense de Postes Canada. De plus, on lui a fourni des parties de donn\u00e9es figurant dans les transcriptions du contre-interrogatoire de M. Wolf. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que l'opinion de M. Wallace quant aux renseignements sur l'emploi n'est que [Traduction] l'opinion personnelle de Postes Canada et que ses opinions ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendantes de celles de son client.\nH. L'analyse du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 de la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle (i) Introduction [552] Les lois sur les droits de la personne demandent que l'on porte une attention constante \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation fond\u00e9e sur l'objet vis\u00e9 par la loi en cause. Dans une r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00e9tablissement , le juge Evans a soulign\u00e9 cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 en affirmant ce qui suit :\nToute analyse d'une question relative aux droits de la personne conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par une loi doit \u00eatre conduite d'une mani\u00e8re qui respecte les objets du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et les grands objectifs des dispositions particuli\u00e8res contest\u00e9es. La qu\u00eate du sens d'un texte l\u00e9gislatif sur les\ndroits de la personne, y compris d'un texte r\u00e9glementaire, doit d\u00e9buter par l'objectif essentiel du texte en question et doit s'articuler constamment autour de cet objectif172.\n[553] Tel que sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au paragraphe [412] le Tribunal accepte que la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable est celle qui devrait s'appliquer lorsque l'on \u00e9value, dans le cadre d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi, comme celle dont le Tribunal est saisi, la fiabilit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois choisi, du processus suivi et des renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s.\n[554] Le Tribunal rejette les arguments de Postes Canada qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'adopter, dans le cadre d'un processus de parit\u00e9 salariale , la norme rigide de la d\u00e9cision correcte . Le Tribunal conclut plut\u00f4t que la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable accept\u00e9e par le tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor favorise davantage l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois sur les droits de la personne, notamment de l'article 11 de la Loi. Dans la cause en l'esp\u00e8ce, la plupart des experts, notamment ceux de Postes Canada, ont d\u00e9crit dans leur t\u00e9moignage le concept d'\u00e9valuation des emplois comme \u00e9tant un concept qui rel\u00e8ve plus de l'art que de la science . Par cons\u00e9quent, toute norme qui n'\u00e9pouse pas ce concept devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[555] Chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9. En d'autres mots, le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois choisi devrait \u00eatre raisonnablement fiable, le processus et la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9s lors de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois et (ou) postes pertinents devraient \u00eatre raisonnablement fiables et les renseignements sur l'emploi ainsi que leurs sources devraient \u00eatre raisonnablement fiables. Les conclusions du Tribunal devraient \u00eatre fond\u00e9es sur la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, laquelle est appliqu\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re civile.\n[556] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9 l'importance de l'examen syst\u00e9matique des t\u00e9moignages fournis par un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins experts. Les composantes du mod\u00e8le syst\u00e9matique employ\u00e9 par le Tribunal ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe [419].\n[557] Les premi\u00e8res composantes du mod\u00e8le ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es. Le Tribunal a pris acte de la partie qui a appel\u00e9 chaque t\u00e9moin expert, de l'expertise de chacun des experts, de son mandat ainsi que des conclusions qu'il a tir\u00e9es. Les t\u00e9moins experts \u00e9taient les personnes suivantes : M. Wolf, Mme Winter, M. Willis, M. Wallace, M. Bellhouse et M. Kervin.\n[558] Alors que les premi\u00e8res composantes du mod\u00e8le syst\u00e9matique font l'objet d'une attention suppl\u00e9mentaire dans la pr\u00e9sente analyse, elles sont examin\u00e9es, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, dans le contexte des autres composantes du mod\u00e8le. En d'autres mots, le Tribunal formulera des observations sur l'\u00e9tendue des connaissances, l'exp\u00e9rience et la r\u00e9putation de chacun des experts dans son champ d'expertise et de quelle mani\u00e8re chacun d'eux s'est acquitt\u00e9 de son mandat et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses conclusions au Tribunal.\n(ii) Le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois choisi [559] C'est la m\u00e9thode de la comparaison des facteurs du plan Hay que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a choisi comme syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Postes Canada, en se fondant sur l'opinion de chacun des trois t\u00e9moins experts, a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9cision de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle d'utiliser ce mod\u00e8le de Hay \u00e9tait sujette \u00e0 caution. En effet, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'utilisation du plan Hay lui-m\u00eame ne convenait pas \u00e0 un processus par lequel on \u00e9valuerait, \u00e0 des fins de parit\u00e9 salariale , des emplois divers relevant du secteur des emplois de bureau et du secteur de l'exploitation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[560] Bien que M. Willis, un t\u00e9moin expert de Postes Canada, e\u00fbt reconnu que le plan Hay, notamment dans son mode bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation, est un instrument d'\u00e9valuation des emplois acceptable, \u00e0 condition que les \u00e9valuateurs aient re\u00e7u la formation ad\u00e9quate, il a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'\u00e9tait mal servie du plan Hay en ayant recours \u00e0 son mode de comparaison des facteurs. M. Wallace, un autre t\u00e9moin expert de Postes Canada, a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay \u00e9tait un instrument d'\u00e9valuation acceptable mais que, selon lui, elle ne convenait pas \u00e0 des emplois de bureau et \u00e0 des emplois qui avaient trait \u00e0 la production et (ou) \u00e0 l'exploitation. M. Wallace a de plus estim\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs \u00e9tait d\u00e9pass\u00e9e depuis longtemps. Un autre t\u00e9moin expert de Postes Canada, Mme Winter, a condamn\u00e9 le plan Hay d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce que, selon elle, il ne convenait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation du travail de bureau, ni du travail de type cols bleus .\n[561] Malgr\u00e9 les opinions de M. Willis et de M. Wallace concernant la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement acceptable du plan Hay en tant qu'instrument d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, Postes Canada, dans ses observations, a critiqu\u00e9 son utilisation quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation du travail de bureau ainsi que du travail de cols bleus . L'avocat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a notamment pr\u00e9tendu que le plan Hay sous-pond\u00e8re le facteur conditions de travail, ce qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une sous-\u00e9valuation d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont importants quant aux postes d'employ\u00e9s de bureau et quant aux postes de type cols bleus .\n[562] L'opinion de M. Willis a \u00e9t\u00e9 caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par l'observation qu'il a faite que l'utilisation de la m\u00e9thode de la comparaison des facteurs du plan Hay peut \u00eatre acceptable lorsqu'elle est appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 un groupe occupationnel unique. Dans une affaire de parit\u00e9 salariale comportant un grand nombre d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, il croyait que la m\u00e9thode de pointage du plan Hay \u00e9tait plus opportune. En effet, M. Wolf, en contre-interrogatoire, avait convenu que, malgr\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de la comparaison des facteurs du plan Hay puisse \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e et est utilis\u00e9e en rapport avec des emplois diff\u00e9rents, elle est plus facile \u00e0 appliquer et fonctionne peut-\u00eatre mieux lorsqu'il est question d'emplois de nature similaire173.\n[563] M. Wolf a mentionn\u00e9 que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9tait d'avis que le plan Hay pouvait tr\u00e8s bien convenir aux emplois d'employ\u00e9s de bureau ainsi qu'aux emplois de cols bleus , notamment avec le facteur renforc\u00e9 des conditions de travail. Cela serait particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans le cas o\u00f9 elle serait appliqu\u00e9e par des \u00e9valuateurs familiers avec les m\u00e9thodes Hay. La Commission, lors de ses \u00e9valuations de 1991, \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d'avis que le plan Hay Plan \u00e9tait en mesure de mesurer les emplois de cols bleus ainsi que les emplois d'employ\u00e9s de bureau.\n[564] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle qui a \u00e9valu\u00e9 l'\u00e9chantillon des postes CR et les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de deux membres qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 chez Hay et qui poss\u00e9daient de nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de travail avec Hay pour le compte d'autres clients. Le Tribunal estime que M. Wolf \u00e9tait le seul t\u00e9moin expert qui \u00e9taient assez qualifi\u00e9, quant aux exigences de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, pour \u00e9valuer d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale la validit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 du plan Hay, notamment de sa m\u00e9thode de la comparaison des facteurs. Bien qu'il n'e\u00fbt pas comparu comme t\u00e9moin expert, M. Ingster, le premier membre de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approch\u00e9 par l'Alliance, a confirm\u00e9, dans des lettres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de pi\u00e8ces justificatives dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, que le plan Hay pouvait tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 quant aux documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe pour \u00e9valuation.\n[565] Le Tribunal souligne la d\u00e9claration faite par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans son rapport, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce PSAC-29, selon laquelle son mandat consistait [Traduction] \u00e0 appliquer la m\u00e9thode Hay quant \u00e0 la nature du travail, et ce, conform\u00e9ment aux meilleures pratiques des experts-conseils de niveau sup\u00e9rieur de Hay, lesquels sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des experts quant \u00e0 l'utilisation du processus des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation . La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Ingster lorsque l'Alliance l'a approch\u00e9 pour lui demander de participer au processus d'\u00e9valuation. L'opinion d'expert, exprim\u00e9e par M. Wolf dans son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix concernant le rapport de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, a renforc\u00e9 la conclusion de l'\u00c9quipe que le mandat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli avec diligence.\n[566] Alors que les trois t\u00e9moins experts pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Postes Canada poss\u00e9daient tous une certaine exp\u00e9rience quant \u00e0 l'utilisation du plan Hay, le Tribunal conclut que seul M. Wolf avait prouv\u00e9 qu'il poss\u00e9dait une connaissance historique approfondie quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution, dans ses diff\u00e9rentes configurations, de la version originale et de l'utilisation du plan Hay au cours de ses nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'application. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 pendant trente ans dans le monde de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois et qu'il s'\u00e9tait servi de la m\u00e9thode Hay pendant environ vingt de ces trente ann\u00e9es. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il a estim\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 plus de 10 000 emplois gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'utilisation du processus Hay, notamment des emplois d'employ\u00e9s de bureau et des emplois de comptabilit\u00e9 de paye et, au d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re, des emplois de cols bleus . De plus, chez Hay, il a travaill\u00e9 comme corr\u00e9lographe ou gardien de la flamme quant au maintien de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me Hay.\n[567] De plus, l'\u00c9quipe comprenait M. Ingster, lequel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approch\u00e9 en premier par l'Alliance et lequel avait obtenu le mandat initial de l'Alliance. M. Ingster a pass\u00e9 le d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re chez Hay et a par la suite travaill\u00e9 en affiliation ind\u00e9pendante avec Hay tout en travaillant avec un large \u00e9ventail de clients.\n[568] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accorde un poids significatif \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Wolf ainsi qu'\u00e0 celle de son coll\u00e8gue, M. Ingster, \u00e0 choisir, dans les circonstances inhabituelles de l'esp\u00e8ce, la configuration du plan Hay qu'il convient le mieux d'utiliser pour \u00e9valuer les emplois\/postes vis\u00e9s.\n[569] Par contre, le Tribunal estime que c'est d'une mani\u00e8re rigide et inflexible que Mme Winter a donn\u00e9 son opinion d'expert par lequel elle a rejet\u00e9 le plan Hay. On a eu l'impression qu'elle a agit comme un t\u00e9moin qui adopte la position de son client plut\u00f4t que comme un expert ind\u00e9pendant qui tente d'aider le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre des concepts difficiles qui d\u00e9bordent de son domaine d'expertise.\n[570] Bien que M. Willis, dans son t\u00e9moignage, n'e\u00fbt pas appuy\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode de la comparaison des facteurs, il n'a pas rejet\u00e9 le plan Hay en tant que tel quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois dans un contexte de parit\u00e9 salariale . Il en fut de m\u00eame pour M. Wallace. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 2 de son rapport, que la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay \u00e9tait [Traduction] [...] un excellent outil d'\u00e9valuation des emplois [...] , mais il a estim\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait pas indiqu\u00e9e lorsqu'il \u00e9tait question [Traduction] [...] d'emplois de bureau et d'emplois li\u00e9s \u00e0 la production et (ou) \u00e0 l'exploitation 174.\n[571] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal estime que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, le plan Hay, qu'il soit utilis\u00e9 selon sa configuration de la m\u00e9thode de comparaison des facteurs ou selon d'autres configurations, est, entre les mains d'\u00e9valuateurs comp\u00e9tents, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas des membres de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, une m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation des emplois acceptable dans son ensemble qui permettra de traiter les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale d'une mani\u00e8re raisonnablement fiable.\n(iii) Le processus [572] Le Tribunal doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question suivante :\n[Traduction]\nSelon toute vraisemblance, le processus suivi par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle lorsqu'elle a fait ses \u00e9valuations des postes\/emplois du groupe plaignant et de ceux du groupe de comparaison, \u00e9tait-il raisonnablement fiable?\n[573] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l'Alliance, a fait ses \u00e9valuations en tant qu'entit\u00e9 qui rend conjointement ses d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 ou par consensus. Selon l'ensemble des t\u00e9moignages d'expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal, cette mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der concorde avec ce que recommandent la majorit\u00e9 des experts dans le domaine. Elle concorde \u00e9galement avec le propre mod\u00e8le de la Commission. L'\u00c9quipe \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e d'un petit nombre de membres et sa composition \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de ce \u00e0 quoi on pourrait normalement s'attendre. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, l'organisme impliqu\u00e9 dans le processus de parit\u00e9 salariale est dot\u00e9 d'un comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation interne. Il se peut qu'il ait recours \u00e0 des conseillers ou \u00e0 une aide externe. En l'esp\u00e8ce, toutefois, la situation qui a amen\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre normale.\n[574] L'existence de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9tait quelque chose de particulier dans le domaine des \u00e9valuations d'emplois en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Le processus par lequel les \u00e9valuations de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e9tait \u00e9galement particulier car il n'y avait aucune participation directe de la part de l'employeur ou des employ\u00e9s dans le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation. De toute \u00e9vidence, il ne s'agissait pas de l'approche normale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une \u00e9valuation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Toutefois, compte tenu du cadre litigieux, ce processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour \u00e9valuer les postes du groupe plaignant et les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques au moyen d'[Traduction] une application rigoureuse de la m\u00e9thode des bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation Hay [...]175 .\n[575] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que ni M. Wolf, ni M. Ingster n'\u00e9taient familiers avec le service postal canadien. En effet, M. Wolf a admis en contre-interrogatoire qu'il n'avait jamais mis les pieds dans une installation de Postes Canada. Bien que le troisi\u00e8me membre de l'\u00c9quipe, Judith Davidson-Palmer, e\u00fbt travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9 cadre, elle \u00e9tait peu famili\u00e8re avec le plan Hay.\n[576] En plus de ses pr\u00e9occupations concernant la composition de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il y avait une p\u00e9nurie de documents \u00e9crits sur la mani\u00e8re exacte selon laquelle l'\u00c9quipe avait effectu\u00e9 son travail. La piste de v\u00e9rification , laquelle constitue habituellement une partie essentielle de tout processus d'\u00e9valuation, \u00e9tait au mieux faible, ce qui a eu pour effet qu'il n'y avait que tr\u00e8s peu de documents \u00e0 l'appui des conclusions de l'\u00c9quipe.\n[577] Les trois t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada qui \u00e9taient familiers avec les processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois ont d\u00e9nigr\u00e9 le travail de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. Mme Winter a soulign\u00e9 que les membres de l'\u00c9quipe n'\u00e9taient pas assez familiers avec le travail de bureau ainsi qu'avec le travail de cols bleus et qu'elle croyait qu'ils avaient effectu\u00e9 une r\u00e9capitulation peu rigoureuse des r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation. Elle a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe de ne pas avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 un ensemble d'\u00e9valuations rep\u00e8res repr\u00e9sentatives et coh\u00e9rentes d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du processus d'\u00e9valuation. De plus, Mme Winter \u00e9tait d'avis que l'ensemble du processus a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 fauss\u00e9 par le classement initial des postes fait par l'\u00c9quipe en fonction des niveaux de classification et des pointages d'\u00e9valuation attribu\u00e9s par la Commission.\n[578] M. Willis a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que l'\u00c9quipe avait manqu\u00e9 de discipline lors de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Par exemple, il a estim\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tape de la r\u00e9capitulation aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre mieux structur\u00e9e. De plus, il s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'utilisation de la technique de la bo\u00eete noire que M. Wolf a utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre du processus d'\u00e9valuation, une technique tir\u00e9e de la formation en g\u00e9nie de ce dernier. M. Willis a \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9 l'utilisation par l'\u00c9quipe de la m\u00e9thode Hay standard am\u00e9ricaine de description des emplois.\n[579] M. Wallace a soulign\u00e9 que les deux membres de l'\u00c9quipe, bien qu'ils fussent des experts reconnus, n'\u00e9taient pas assez familiers avec les op\u00e9rations postales. Il a \u00e9galement tenu des propos d\u00e9favorables sur ce qu'il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le manque de discipline et de rigueur de l'\u00c9quipe dans le cadre du processus d'\u00e9valuation, notamment en ce qui avait trait aux lacunes de la piste de v\u00e9rification .\n[580] Le Tribunal souligne que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle s'\u00e9tait attaqu\u00e9e \u00e0 sa t\u00e2che d'une mani\u00e8re plut\u00f4t inhabituelle. Elle a litt\u00e9ralement d\u00fb, dans un d\u00e9lai relativement court, passer en revue des milliers de pages de documents et de pi\u00e8ces justificatives compil\u00e9es par d'autres. La preuve montre que les membres de l'\u00c9quipe n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capables d'adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 la discipline et \u00e0 la rigueur pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 laquelle on est normalement en droit de s'attendre dans le cadre d'un processus mixte syndical-patronal o\u00f9 le comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuation est compos\u00e9 de membres du personnel administratif ainsi que d'autres employ\u00e9s. La difficult\u00e9 pos\u00e9e par l'\u00e9valuation dans un tel cadre a toutefois grandement \u00e9t\u00e9 att\u00e9nu\u00e9e par les comp\u00e9tences particuli\u00e8res des trois membres du comit\u00e9. Deux des membres poss\u00e9daient de nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience quant \u00e0 l'utilisation du plan Hay et d'autres syst\u00e8mes dans le cadre d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Le troisi\u00e8me membre de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada dans le domaine de la gestion et du d\u00e9veloppement organisationnel. En travaillant ensemble, ils croyaient qu'ils \u00e9taient capables de r\u00e9aliser la t\u00e2che qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e. Leur rapport ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix de M. Wolf donnaient \u00e0 penser que l'\u00c9quipe estimait que le processus au moyen duquel elle avait effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations, bien que non conventionnel, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris avec une rigueur et une diligence raisonnable.\n[581] Le Tribunal accepte cette opinion et estime que le processus, entrepris dans le contexte d'une situation litigieuse unique selon une m\u00e9thode d\u00e9pendante de la comp\u00e9tence et de l'exp\u00e9rience de la petite \u00c9quipe professionnelle, \u00e9tait raisonnablement fiable. In\u00e9vitablement, il ne s'agissait pas du meilleur processus dont on aurait pu se servir si les parties avaient travaill\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re habituelle, c'est-\u00e0-dire en collaboration. Toutefois, selon le Tribunal, il s'agissait d'un processus raisonnablement fiable compte tenu des circonstances dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9.\n[582] Cette acceptation par le Tribunal de l'opinion de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et, notamment, de celle de M. Wolf que le processus d'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00c9quipe \u00e9tait raisonnablement fiable, repose sur sa conclusion que le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de M. Wolf \u00e9tait plus cr\u00e9dible que celui pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les experts de Postes Canada, c'est-\u00e0-dire Mme Winter, M. Willis et M. Wallace. M. Wolf a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent lors du processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois et a particip\u00e9 comme membre de l'\u00c9quipe. Son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 factuel et digne d'un expert.\n[583] En accordant plus de poids au t\u00e9moignage de M. Wolf, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que le processus suivi par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle n'\u00e9tait pas le meilleur.\n[584] Le poids, s'il en est, que le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 au t\u00e9moignage d'expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Postes Canada, n'a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour d\u00e9savouer l'opinion de M. Wolf que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un processus d'\u00e9valuation raisonnablement fiable.\n[585] Mme Winter, une femme d'affaires qui a r\u00e9ussi par ses propres moyens, pr\u00e9sidente de sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'experts-conseils, a travaill\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es chez Hay Canada o\u00f9 elle a obtenu le titre de vice-pr\u00e9sidente directrice et d'associ\u00e9e. T\u00e9moin parfois ergoteur, ses opinions dans son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix et dans ses rapports tendaient \u00e0 \u00eatre rigides et \u00e0 exiger de l'absolu en mati\u00e8re de mesure de fiabilit\u00e9.\n[586] M. Willis a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re en \u00e9valuation des emplois chez Hay aux \u00c9tats-Unis et a fond\u00e9 sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'experts-conseils en 1971. Apr\u00e8s avoir mis au point son propre plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois en 1974, il a effectu\u00e9 de nombreuses \u00e9tudes d'\u00e9valuation des emplois aux \u00c9tats-Unis et au Canada. Il a donn\u00e9 des conseils au Comit\u00e9 mixte ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor. Ce Comit\u00e9 a utilis\u00e9 le plan Willis dans le cadre de ses \u00e9valuations d'emplois.\n[587] M. Willis a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans un cadre non litigieux et dans un cadre de coop\u00e9ration. Bien que son rapport n'en fit pas \u00e9tat, son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix a confirm\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas lu l'ensemble des documents d\u00e9taill\u00e9s que Postes Canada lui avait envoy\u00e9s. Les r\u00e9ponses qu'il a donn\u00e9es en contre-interrogatoire \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t \u00e9vasives quant au temps qu'il avait consacr\u00e9 au travail que Postes Canada lui avait confi\u00e9. Bien que, de toute \u00e9vidence, il \u00e9tait un expert conseil accompli, maintenant \u00e0 la retraite, qui a dirig\u00e9 sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant environ 25 ans, les mani\u00e8res qu'il a affich\u00e9es devant le Tribunal ont \u00e9t\u00e9 brusques \u00e0 certains moments.\n[588] M. Wallace a commenc\u00e9 sa longue carri\u00e8re en \u00e9valuation des emplois en participant \u00e0 l'introduction du syst\u00e8me Hay \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al dans les ann\u00e9es 70. Il a ensuite g\u00e9r\u00e9 le processus Hay chez Shell Canada et l'a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au processus Hay mondial pour le compte de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re, Royal Dutch Shell. Il est vice-pr\u00e9sident directeur d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'experts-conseils depuis la fin de 1996.\n[589] Le mandat de M. Wallace n'avait pour objet que l'examen du processus entrepris par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 2000 quant \u00e0 l'incidence qu'avaient eu les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels fournis ult\u00e9rieurement par un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada sur ses \u00e9valuations de 1993\/1994.\n[590] M. Wallace s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant le Tribunal comme une personne qui avait appris beaucoup de choses sur le tas quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois et quant \u00e0 la conception de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Son opinion, critique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, reposait sur les normes de l'industrie avec lesquelles il \u00e9tait familier et qui \u00e9taient, selon lui, des normes plut\u00f4t strictes. Il n'a manifest\u00e9 aucun respect \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'accorder une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale aux lois sur les droits de la personne.\n[591] Le Tribunal, bien qu'il n'accorde aucun poids, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter quant au processus d'\u00e9valuation utilis\u00e9 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, ne rej\u00e8te pas enti\u00e8rement les t\u00e9moignages de M. Willis et de M. Wallace. Au contraire, un certain nombre des critiques qu'ils ont formul\u00e9es traitaient d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments que l'on pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait, dans des circonstances normales, ne pas voir dans un processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Il s'agit donc d'\u00e9tablir le degr\u00e9 d'importance qui doit leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\n[592] Par cons\u00e9quent, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage des experts, le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 moins de poids aux t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada qu'aux t\u00e9moignages de M. Wolf et de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[593] En ce faisant, le Tribunal conclut que, selon toute vraisemblance, le processus d'\u00e9valuation que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a utilis\u00e9 dans le cadre de son travail \u00e9tait raisonnablement fiable.\nVI. LA FIABILIT\u00c9 DES SOURCES DE RENSEIGNEMENTS SUR LES EMPLOIS ET LES RENSEIGNEMENTS OBTENUS UTILIS\u00c9S PAR L' \u00c9QUIPE PROFESSIONNELLE A. Contexte [594] Les trois parties ont convenu de l'importance vitale quant \u00e0 l'utilisation de renseignements et de donn\u00e9es fiables dans le cadre de plans d'\u00e9valuation d'emplois, quels que soient ces plans. Les trois experts en \u00e9valuation des emplois de Postes Canada ont insist\u00e9 sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de travailler avec des renseignements et des donn\u00e9es fiables, bien que l'opinion de Mme Winter favorisait une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable comme l'a confirm\u00e9 l'\u00e9change suivant qu'elle a eu en contre-interrogatoire avec l'avocat de l'Alliance :\n[Traduction]\nQ. Alors, \u00eates-vous en train de dire, ou plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9clarer, que, afin d'\u00e9valuer les emplois avec pr\u00e9cision, on doit conna\u00eetre ceux-ci \u00e0 100 p. 100?\nR. Oui176.\n[595] M. Wolf et M. Willis ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, selon eux, il est de premi\u00e8re importance que l'on poss\u00e8de d'abord une bonne compr\u00e9hension des emplois que l'on \u00e9value (la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois est \u00e9galement de premi\u00e8re importance). En second lieu, on doit poss\u00e9der une bonne compr\u00e9hension du processus \u00e0 suivre :\n[Traduction]\nM. Wolf : de toute mani\u00e8re, pour \u00eatre un expert-conseil Hay, le temps que l'on doit consacrer au processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois est moins important que la compr\u00e9hension que l'on poss\u00e8de de ces emplois. La r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois est la m\u00eame qu'en informatique : \u00e0 donn\u00e9es inexactes, r\u00e9sultats erron\u00e9s. Si on ne poss\u00e8de pas une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l'emploi on ne peut pas l'\u00e9valuer correctement, peu importe jusqu'\u00e0 quel point on poss\u00e8de une bonne compr\u00e9hension de la technologie du processus177.\nM. Willis : apr\u00e8s la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements, je dirais que c'est le processus qui vient au deuxi\u00e8me rang au chapitre de l'importance178.\n[596] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe [413], la norme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise dans l'industrie de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, laquelle norme \u00e9tait connue par l'ensemble des t\u00e9moins experts, consiste \u00e0 obtenir, dans la mesure du possible, des renseignements sur les emplois qui sont pr\u00e9cis, coh\u00e9rents et complets. Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce la norme de fiabilit\u00e9 du caract\u00e8re raisonnable (paragraphes [412] et [553]), une pr\u00e9cision raisonnable, une coh\u00e9rence raisonnable et une int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 raisonnable sont donc exig\u00e9es.\n[597] Par cons\u00e9quent, des renseignements et des donn\u00e9es sur les emplois raisonnablement fiables sont un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois en tant que concept, compte tenu de sa d\u00e9pendance intrins\u00e8que \u00e0 un jugement humain subjectif. Les d\u00e9cisions des \u00e9valuateurs qui utilisent des renseignements sur les emplois raisonnablement pr\u00e9cis, coh\u00e9rents et complets devraient, naturellement, et en fait, logiquement, produirent des r\u00e9sultats plus r\u00e9alistes et plus acceptables que les d\u00e9cisions des \u00e9valuateurs qui utilisent des renseignements douteux ou erron\u00e9s.\n[598] Bien que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 relev\u00e9, dans le moindre d\u00e9tail, les sources et la nature des renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner ces sources et les renseignements sur les emplois de fa\u00e7on simplifi\u00e9e en deux \u00e9tapes. Le Tribunal a catalogu\u00e9 les renseignements sur les emplois et leurs sources de la mani\u00e8re suivante pour en faciliter le renvoi :\nLES FAITS I : Il s'agit des sources de renseignements factuels sur les emplois, des renseignements et des donn\u00e9es sur les emplois qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus \u00e0 partir de ces sources, lesquelles sources existaient avant la date \u00e0 laquelle l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a entrepris son travail pour le compte de l'Alliance.\nLES FAITS II : Il s'agit des donn\u00e9es et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires pertinents auxquels l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a eu acc\u00e8s apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 son travail.\nB. LES FAITS I (i) Contenu [599] Sous forme r\u00e9capitulative, les FAITS I comprennent ce qui suit :\nle Questionnaire\/Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli en 1986 par des employ\u00e9s \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u par un cadre sup\u00e9rieur de la Commission, sans aide professionnelle, pour fonctionner avec le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois System One, lequel n'\u00e9tait pas encore tout \u00e0 fait au point. Bien qu'il vis\u00e2t \u00e0 servir de source de premi\u00e8re importance de renseignements \u00e0 jour quant aux postes CR et PO, il n'a en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par la Commission que pour les postes CR; le Guide d'entrevue a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u par le personnel de la Commission et a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur System One. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u afin d'\u00eatre rempli par les intervieweurs de la Commission comme suivi du Questionnaire\/Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 que pour les employ\u00e9s CR; les entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en d\u00e9cembre 1986; les descriptions d'emploi et les organigrammes qui \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s \u00eatre joints au Questionnaire\/Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi par l'employ\u00e9 titulaire qui remplit ce formulaire. La plupart des descriptions de poste CR \u00e9taient non officielles , notamment de nombreuses descriptions de postes rep\u00e8res CR; de nombreux organigrammes CR \u00e9taient p\u00e9rim\u00e9s; on a tent\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s de cr\u00e9er des \u00e9chantillons de postes PO avec de nouvelles listes d'employ\u00e9s PO datant de 1989. \u00c0 la place d'\u00e9chantillons, 10 particularit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9riques d'emploi PO ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9es en 1990\/1991 par la Commission. Le personnel cadre de Postes Canada a fourni les renseignements et les documents qui ont servi de fondement, notamment les descriptions d'emploi non officielles et les profils d'emploi qui d\u00e9crivaient les responsabilit\u00e9s de chaque emploi. Ces particularit\u00e9s d'emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9es d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e quant aux particularit\u00e9s des postes CR, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9es au moyen de ce que la Commission a appel\u00e9 un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire d'employ\u00e9s CR occupant de v\u00e9ritables postes; Les 10 emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques repr\u00e9sentaient un amalgame de fonctions pour les 10 types d'emplois les plus r\u00e9pandus au sein du groupe PO. Ils ne repr\u00e9sentaient pas de v\u00e9ritables emplois ou postes et n'\u00e9taient pas cautionn\u00e9s par le syndicat. Le sous-groupe de supervision PO, lequel constituait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du groupe de comparaison dans la plainte initiale, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans les caract\u00e9ristiques des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , contrairement \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillon CR qui comprenait un certain nombre de repr\u00e9sentants de supervision de niveau CR-5.\n[600] Il s'agit-l\u00e0 des sources cl\u00e9s et de la nature des renseignements sur les emplois obtenus \u00e0 partir de ces sources durant la p\u00e9riode 1986 \u00e0 1991 qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[601] Li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces sources ainsi qu'aux renseignements sur les emplois obtenus \u00e0 partir de ces sources, il convient de souligner, dans le contexte des FAITS I, quatre faits qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s ailleurs dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision car ils ont une incidence potentielle sur la nature des renseignements sur les emplois obtenus \u00e0 partir de ces sources.\n[602] Le premier de ces faits est l'incertitude qui entoure les divers calculs non professionnels de la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon CR. L'\u00e9chantillon CR original a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 en 1986 par un agent de la Commission. En 1987, la Commission n'a pas suivi les conseils de Statistique Canada quant \u00e0 la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon CR. L'\u00e9chantillon CR a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit en 1991 par le personnel de la Commission.\n[603] Le deuxi\u00e8me fait est que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et le Guide d'entrevue ont tous les deux \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us en fonction du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation inachev\u00e9 System One, lequel n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 ni par l'Alliance, ni par Postes Canada.\n[604] Le troisi\u00e8me fait est que les donn\u00e9es sur les emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies \u00e0 des moments diff\u00e9rents. Les donn\u00e9es quant aux postes CR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies en 1986. La majeure partie des donn\u00e9es quant aux emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques a \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillie en 1990\/1991.\n[605] Le quatri\u00e8me fait est l'incompatibilit\u00e9 apparente existant entre les renseignements sur les emplois recueillis quant aux postes CR d\u00e9tenus par des titulaires de poste, et les particularit\u00e9s d'emploi compil\u00e9es par la Commission quant aux emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques non d\u00e9tenus par des titulaires de poste.\n[606] Le Tribunal souligne qu'aucune des parties ne contestent que l'ensemble des FAITS I se sont produits bien avant que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 approch\u00e9e par l'Alliance ou qu'elle n'e\u00fbt commenc\u00e9 son travail.\n(ii) Les observations des parties et des t\u00e9moins experts [607] En se concentrant exclusivement sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de FAITS I, quels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les principaux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties et les t\u00e9moins experts dans leurs arguments respectifs quant \u00e0 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments?\n[608] Il y a pratiquement eu unanimit\u00e9 entre M. Wolf et deux des t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada quant au Questionnaire\/Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi de 1986. C'est M. Wolf qui a qualifi\u00e9 ce document d' abominable tout en ajoutant que [...] la personne qui l'a con\u00e7u devrait \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9e et fusill\u00e9e (paragraphe [445]). M. Willis et Mme Winter l'ont rejet\u00e9, M. Willis l'a qualifi\u00e9 d' [...] absolument insuffisant si l'on voulait faire une \u00e9valuation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale (paragraphe [497]). Postes Canada, l'a \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9 au motif qu'il relevait de l'auto\u00e9valuation et que l'opinion r\u00e9pandue dans le monde de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois \u00e9tait qu'il \u00e9tait inacceptable.\n[609] Malgr\u00e9 sa condamnation de la conception de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui-m\u00eame et ses deux coll\u00e8gues l'utilisaient encore parfois en ne tenant pas compte des aspects auto-\u00e9valuatifs des r\u00e9ponses et en se concentrant sur les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 la description des emplois qui se trouve dans le document rempli. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question de l'avocat de l'Alliance, M. Wolf a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nNous devions malheureusement, si l'on veut, travailler \u00e0 contre-courant avec ces documents, mais il y avait des renseignements l\u00e0-dedans. Nous devions \u00eatre s\u00e9lectifs dans leur utilisation afin de s'assurer que nous ne tenions pas compte de la partie non pertinente179 .\n[610] M. Willis et Mme Winter ont \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9 le Guide d'entrevue de 1986 car ils croyaient qu'il comportait un bon nombre des lacunes figurant dans la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi tout en soulignant que le Guide \u00e9tait \u00e9galement fond\u00e9 sur le plan d'\u00e9valuation System One, lequel \u00e9tait toujours en cours d'\u00e9laboration. M. Wolf lui-m\u00eame a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Guide d'entrevue n'ajoutait rien d'important \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension que poss\u00e9dait l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle quant aux fonctions des titulaires de poste CR.\n[611] M. Wolf a reconnu qu'environ 50 des descriptions de poste CR n'\u00e9taient pas sign\u00e9es et (ou) non dat\u00e9es, que d'autres \u00e9taient souvent p\u00e9rim\u00e9es ou non officielles et parfois m\u00eame manquantes. Un certain nombre des descriptions ne comprenaient pas de renseignements sur les conditions de travail. De m\u00eame, des organigrammes \u00e0 l'appui n'\u00e9taient pas toujours disponibles ou n'\u00e9taient pas toujours \u00e0 jour.\n[612] Deux des t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada ont relev\u00e9 des lacunes importantes dans les descriptions d'emploi, principalement sur le plan de l'\u00e2ge, de la pr\u00e9cision ainsi que du statut officiel. Les trois t\u00e9moins ont soulign\u00e9 l'importance que les personnes responsables des \u00e9valuations soient tout \u00e0 fait satisfaites des descriptions d'emploi.\n[613] M. Wolf a admis que, en raison du caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement inacceptable de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi, laquelle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e \u00eatre le document source de premi\u00e8re importance aux fins d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de se fier sur les descriptions de poste disponibles comme document de premi\u00e8re importance quant aux \u00e9valuations CR. M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui-m\u00eame et ses coll\u00e8gues avaient accept\u00e9 telles quelles les descriptions de poste, du moment qu'elles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le format accept\u00e9 par Postes Canada.\n[614] M. Wolf a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce que l'on voulait dire par traiter les descriptions de poste comme document de premi\u00e8re importance, par rapport \u00e0 la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et au Guide d'entrevue, dans l'\u00e9change suivant qu'il a eu en contre-interrogatoire avec l'avocat de Postes Canada :\n[Traduction]\n[...] lorsque nous disons document de premi\u00e8re importance, ce que nous voulons dire c'est que lorsqu'il y a un certain doute quant \u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence des documents, \u00e0 quel document doit-on se reporter, la r\u00e9ponse est que nous devons nous reporter \u00e0 la description de poste comme document officiel de Postes Canada. Donc, lorsque nous disons qu'il s'agit du document de premi\u00e8re importance, c'est \u00e0 celui-l\u00e0 que nous devons nous reporter180.\n[615] Dans les cas o\u00f9 il n'y avait aucune description de poste - et cela s'est produit dans un assez grand nombre de cas (paragraphe [448]) - M. Wolf a convenu qu'un tel report ne serait de toute \u00e9vidence pas possible.\n[616] M. Willis, tout en reconnaissant que les particularit\u00e9s des emplois PO avaient davantage fourni de renseignements factuels sur l'emploi que les documents CR, a fait la mise en garde que ces premiers documents \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des donn\u00e9s sur l'emploi fournies par la direction et non pas sur des donn\u00e9es fournis par les employ\u00e9s, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus appropri\u00e9. De plus, il a soulign\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 la pratique reconnue, les donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi pour chacun des groupes d'employ\u00e9s CR et PO avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies au moyen de processus tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents, et ce, \u00e0 deux \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes.\n[617] Mme Winter a formul\u00e9 la critique que les particularit\u00e9s des emplois PO ne refl\u00e9taient pas les v\u00e9ritables postes et qu'elles \u00e9taient incompl\u00e8tes car elles ne comprenaient pas le travail en rotation des PO-4.\n[618] En examinant le premier des quatre faits mentionn\u00e9s - l'incertitude quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillonnage CR dont il est fait mention au paragraphe [602] - il est n\u00e9cessaire de recourir aux t\u00e9moignages des deux t\u00e9moins experts, M. Bellhouse et M. Kervin.\n[619] Il existe une diff\u00e9rence d'opinion appr\u00e9ciable entre ces deux t\u00e9moins experts. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, M. Bellhouse a pr\u00e9tendu que la conception de l'\u00e9chantillonnage original de 1986, de la Commission, \u00e0 partir duquel s'est faite la s\u00e9lection des titulaires de poste CR pour le sondage, \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que l'\u00e9chantillonnage d'employ\u00e9s fait par la Commission plut\u00f4t que l'\u00e9chantillonnage de postes a men\u00e9 \u00e0 de la partialit\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9chantillon, laquelle partialit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9e par le niveau de non-r\u00e9ponse au sondage \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard duquel aucune mesure corrective n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e.\n[620] En particulier, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 M. Bellhouse a cru comprendre que les niveaux de classification CR \u00e9taient compos\u00e9s d'intervalles chevauchants de points Hay, il a estim\u00e9 qu'un recensement complet de chacun des postes CR consituait la voie \u00e0 suivre. Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat de l'Alliance quant \u00e0 savoir si les intervalles chevauchants de points Hay et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9e sur ces intervalles \u00e9tait une question de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plut\u00f4t qu'une question de statistique, M. Bellhouse a r\u00e9pondu que, compte tenu de l'existence d'un tel chevauchement, il recommandait de faire un recensement.\n[621] Durant son r\u00e9interrogatoire par l'avocat de Postes Canada, M. Bellhouse a toutefois convenu qu'un recensement complet pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 si l'on recherchait une valeur moyenne par titre de poste CR plut\u00f4t que par poste. On red\u00e9finirait la collectivit\u00e9 CR par l'ensemble de ses titres de poste et, en pr\u00e9sumant de beaucoup d'homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9, on prendrait un \u00e9chantillon appropri\u00e9 dans chaque titre de poste181.\n[622] Le Tribunal souligne que dans un t\u00e9moignage ant\u00e9rieur relatif \u00e0 l'omission de la Commission de mettre en application une recommandation d'augmentation de l'\u00e9chantillon CR faite par Statistique Canada en 1987, Statistique Canada a fait des commentaires sur la conception d'un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire acceptable plut\u00f4t que de faire un recensement.\n[623] Quant aux 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques , M. Bellhouse ne les a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire. Il a estim\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient tout au plus un \u00e9chantillon choisi \u00e0 dessein comportant la possibilit\u00e9 d'une partialit\u00e9 importante parce qu'il s'agissait d'une s\u00e9lection de titres de poste particuliers (paragraphes [454] \u00e0 [459]).\n[624] L'opinion de M. Kervin \u00e9tait que M. Bellhouse avait trop insist\u00e9 sur l'aspect analytique de l'analyse statistique et sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une fiabilit\u00e9 quantitative scientifique. Le point de M. Kervin \u00e9tait que M. Bellhouse avait omis de reconna\u00eetre les questions sociologiques, qualitatives et syst\u00e9miques soulev\u00e9es dans une affaire de parit\u00e9 salariale . M. Kervin a de plus mentionn\u00e9 que l'\u00e9chantillon repr\u00e9sentatif d'employ\u00e9s CR qui a servi de base \u00e0 la collecte de donn\u00e9es pour le groupe plaignant \u00e9tait plus qu'ad\u00e9quat. Il \u00e9tait d'accord avec M. Bellhouse pour affirmer que les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques constituaient un \u00e9chantillon choisi \u00e0 dessein (paragraphes [466] \u00e0 [468]).\n[625] Le Tribunal est conscient des profils diff\u00e9rents de ces deux experts. L'un a donn\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage d'opinion en fonction de son expertise comme statisticien professionnel, l'autre, en fonction de son expertise comme sociologue professionnel. M. Bellhouse, un professeur de statistiques, a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en statistiques, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en sondage aux fins d'\u00e9chantillonnage. M. Kervin, un professeur de sociologie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en collecte et en analyse de donn\u00e9es. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, les deux experts poss\u00e8dent une vaste exp\u00e9rience de travail avec des clients qui paient pour leurs services ainsi qu'avec des \u00e9tudiants, dans leurs champs d'expertise respectifs. Selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour qualifier chacun d'eux d'expert, les deux jouissent d'une bonne r\u00e9putation dans leurs domaines.\n[626] \u00c0 ce stade-ci, la question est celle de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable de la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9chantillonnage et de la taille de l'\u00e9chantillon employ\u00e9 pour la population CR. La plus grande partie du t\u00e9moignage d'expert concernant la r\u00e9alisation d'une \u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale dans des circonstances normales a soulign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de demander des avis d'expert aupr\u00e8s de professionnels. En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'expertise dans la conception et la mise en uvre d'une technologie d'\u00e9chantillonnage d'enqu\u00eate statistique \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, mais elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9e pour l'\u00e9chantillon de 1986.\n[627] M. Kervin a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en collecte et en analyse de donn\u00e9es. Il ne se consid\u00e9rait pas comme un statisticien professionnel. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par l'avocat de la Commission, il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nJe ne suis pas un statisticien. Je ne produis pas de nouvelles statistiques. Je n'examine pas les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des statistiques. Je les utilise plut\u00f4t [...]182\n[628] En revanche, M. Bellhouse s'est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un statisticien en \u00e9chantillonnage 183.\n[629] M. Willis a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le processus de s\u00e9lection de l'\u00e9chantillon CR ne rencontrait pas les exigences rigoureuses en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9chantillonnage dans une affaire de parit\u00e9 salariale . Bien qu'il n'e\u00fbt pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'un recensement \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, son opinion semblait \u00eatre plus proche de celui de M. Bellhouse que de celui de M. Kervin.\n[630] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est saisi de deux opinions contradictoires quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire CR. Id\u00e9alement, on aimerait r\u00e9examiner la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9chantillonnage employ\u00e9e. Mais, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que l'\u00e9chantillon original de titulaires de poste \u00e9tait important, repr\u00e9sentant pr\u00e8s de 10 p. 100 de la population CR totale. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a choisi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d'\u00e9valuer les postes de l'\u00e9chantillon original au complet et de ne pas se limiter \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillon ult\u00e9rieurement r\u00e9duit de la Commission. De plus, on a fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve factuel solide d\u00e9montrant que l'\u00e9chantillon total n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sentatif de la collectivit\u00e9 CR totale.\n[631] Le deuxi\u00e8me fait relat\u00e9 (paragraphe [603]) concerne le fait que la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et le Guide d'entrevue ont tous les deux \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us en fonction du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois System One dont l'\u00e9laboration \u00e9tait inachev\u00e9e. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a employ\u00e9 le plan de comparaison des facteurs Hay lorsqu'elle a effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations des emplois. L'utilisation d'un plan donn\u00e9 pour concevoir l'instrumentation - m\u00eame s'il n'est utilis\u00e9 qu'en partie - et l'utilisation d'un autre plan pour effectuer les \u00e9valuations des emplois, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l'industrie, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, comme \u00e9tant une pratique inacceptable.\n[632] Certes, le livret de la Commission intitul\u00e9 Mise en uvre de la parit\u00e9 salariale dans la sph\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale publi\u00e9 en 1992 \u00e9nonce tr\u00e8s clairement qu' [...] il est essentiel d'utiliser un seul et m\u00eame plan pour \u00e9valuer tous les postes (paragraphe [358]), ce qui, \u00e0 tout le moins, sous-entend, sinon affirme explicitement, qu'un seul plan d'\u00e9valuation devrait r\u00e9gir l'ensemble des aspects d'une entreprise d'\u00e9valuation d'emplois particuli\u00e8re, notamment l'aspect de la collecte de documents de renseignements sur les emplois.\n[633] Le troisi\u00e8me fait (paragraphe [604]) a trait \u00e0 la collecte de donn\u00e9es sur les emplois effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes. Les donn\u00e9es sur les postes CR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies en 1986 alors que les donn\u00e9es sur les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 principalement recueillies en 1990\/1991. M. Willis a fait des commentaires sur l'opportunit\u00e9 de recueillir des renseignements sur les emplois pour l'ensemble des emplois qui font l'objet d'une comparaison dans des d\u00e9lais raisonnablement rapproch\u00e9s.\n[634] Le quatri\u00e8me fait (paragraphe [605]) concerne l'incongruit\u00e9 existant entre les renseignements sur les emplois recueillis aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s titulaires de poste CR et les particularit\u00e9s de l'emploi compil\u00e9es par la Commission pour les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques non d\u00e9tenus par des titulaires de poste. Deux des experts de Postes Canada ont contest\u00e9 cette approche.\n(iii) La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins experts [635] Quelle fut la position de chacune des parties concernant les documents de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui composent ce que le Tribunal a appel\u00e9 les FAITS I?\n[636] Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9, en effet, que les renseignements mentionn\u00e9s dans les FAITS I ne peuvent pas servir pour faire des \u00e9valuations d'emploi fiables.\n[637] L'Alliance a contest\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'ensemble des trois t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada - Mme Winter, essentiellement parce qu'elle ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 la norme de l'ind\u00e9pendance du t\u00e9moin expert et parce qu'elle \u00e9tait trop cat\u00e9gorique ou qu'elle avait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sentant ses opinions; M. Willis pour ne pas avoir lu l'ensemble des documents que Postes Canada lui avait envoy\u00e9s et \u00e9galement parce qu'il \u00e9tait incapable ou refusait de comprendre le contexte litigieux de la plainte; et M. Wallace parce qu'il n'avait pas eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une grande partie des documents vis\u00e9s dans l'affaire et sa tendance \u00e0 souligner les aspects n\u00e9gatifs et \u00e0 ignorer les aspects positifs.\n[638] La Commission a \u00e9cart\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter essentiellement parce qu'elle a invoqu\u00e9 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte comme fondement de ses opinions d'expert. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Willis a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute par la Commission au motif qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clair, voire m\u00eame ambigu et \u00e9vasif quant au temps qu'il avait pris pour examiner les documents sur l'emploi que Postes Canada lui avait envoy\u00e9s. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que l'opinion critique de M. Wallace quant aux renseignements sur les emplois devrait \u00eatre en grande partie \u00e9cart\u00e9e parce qu'il n'a pas examin\u00e9 et qu'on ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 d'examiner la plus grande partie des documents sur les emplois.\n[639] En autant que les trois t\u00e9moins experts de Postes Canada sont concern\u00e9s, le Tribunal conclut que les t\u00e9moignages de M. Willis et de M. Wallace ne devraient pas \u00eatre totalement rejet\u00e9s. Certains aspects de leurs t\u00e9moignages m\u00e9ritent qu'on leur accorde un certain poids. Dans la cas de Mme Winter dans lequel sa norme absolue de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 presque tous les \u00e9gards exigeant un jugement quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9, a rendu, de l'avis du Tribunal, ses opinions inacceptables\n[640] M. Willis, toutefois, \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin qui poss\u00e9dait un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans l'industrie de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Il a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu \u00e9vasif, voire m\u00eame acerbe \u00e0 l'occasion, lorsque, par exemple, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par l'avocat de Postes Canada, il a r\u00e9pondu :\n[Traduction]\n[...] les trois consultants de la CCDP et de l'AFPC ont d\u00fb travailler avec des donn\u00e9es inad\u00e9quates. Je crois qu'elles \u00e9taient \u00e0 ce point inad\u00e9quates, qu'aucun d'entre eux n'a pu - sans apport additionnel, sans renseignements additionnels, je ne vois pas comment l'un d'eux aurait pu faire un bon travail.\nSelon mon analyse globale, je ne peux pas reculer d'un pas : c'est bon pour la poubelle [...]184\n[641] L'attitude de M. Willis ne devrait pas annuler totalement son expertise. Le fait qu'il ait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Initiative conjointe syndicale-patronale, puis qu'il ait servi par la suite de t\u00e9moin expert dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, illustrent la connaissance intime de son domaine ainsi que son exp\u00e9rience et sa r\u00e9putation dans ce m\u00eame domaine.\n[642] Le Tribunal est conscient de la grande quantit\u00e9 de documents soumis dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il y a eu plus de 400 volumes de transcriptions et environ mille pi\u00e8ces justificatives. Bien que tous ces documents ne furent pas tous envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Willis, celui-ci en a re\u00e7u un bon nombre \u00e0 examiner. Un t\u00e9moin expert du calibre et de r\u00e9putation continentale comme M. Willis aurait rep\u00e9r\u00e9 des lacunes manifestes dans un certain nombre de documents figurant dans les FAITS I, comme ceux concernant la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9chantillonnage CR, la conception de la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et du Guide d'entrevue, et ce, m\u00eame sans avoir lu l'ensemble des documents.\n[643] M. Wallace poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement une vaste exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Bien que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, son mandat portait sur un aspect et une p\u00e9riode de temps plus limit\u00e9s, comportant beaucoup moins de documents que le mandat de M. Willis, ses connaissances et l'intensit\u00e9 qu'il mettait \u00e0 appliquer les objectifs et les principes de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, notamment dans le secteur priv\u00e9, et dans des cas de parit\u00e9 salariale , \u00e9taient impressionnants.\nC. LES FAITS II (i) Le contenu et son effet [644] Les FAITS II constituent les renseignements, donn\u00e9es et t\u00e9moignages additionnels pertinents, autres que ceux de FAITS I, auxquels l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a eu acc\u00e8s en entreprenant ses \u00e9valuations de postes CR et des emplois PO en 1993\/1994 (compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en 2000).\n[645] Un de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments additionnels que l'Alliance a fourni \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe \u00e9tait les documents Hay que la Commission avait initialement re\u00e7us de l'organisation Hay, notamment les bar\u00e8mes d'\u00e9valuation et une gamme d'\u00e9chantillons de d\u00e9finitions de facteurs d'\u00e9valuation Hay. M. Ingster a inform\u00e9 l'Alliance, dans la correspondance qu'il a eue avec elle, que les documents Hay n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par la Commission. Il s'agissait plut\u00f4t de documents de pr\u00e9sentation de base Hay.\n[646] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9galement eu acc\u00e8s en 1993 aux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de justification de la Commission dans lesquels \u00e9taient consign\u00e9s ses classements et ses motifs \u00e0 l'appui, pour les \u00e9valuations des emplois qu'elle avait faites en 1991 de l'\u00e9chantillon r\u00e9duit de 93 titulaires de poste CR. Les \u00e9valuations CR faites par la Commission en 1991 \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur le plan Hay XYZ. L'\u00c9quipe s'est \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9e sur ses propres \u00e9valuations de l'\u00e9chantillon original de 93 postes pour fournir des postes rep\u00e8res quant \u00e0 sa deuxi\u00e8me phase de 97 postes CR qu'elle a entreprise en 1994. Les notes prises par les membres de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle durant leurs entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec les titulaires de poste CR men\u00e9es en mai 1993 et en septembre 1994, ont constitu\u00e9 des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires sur les postes CR dont disposait l'\u00c9quipe.\n[647] Quant \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 PO, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a eu acc\u00e8s aux dimensions comportementales pour chaque emploi que la Commission avait obtenus de Postes Canada ainsi qu'aux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de justification de la Commission mentionnant ses classements d'\u00e9valuation de poste de 1991, avec motifs \u00e0 l'appui, des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques fond\u00e9s sur le plan Hay XYZ. M. Ingster avait toutefois inform\u00e9 l'Alliance, dans la lettre qu'il lui avait envoy\u00e9e le 21 juillet 1993, que les dimensions comportementales et les profils d'emploi n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis quant \u00e0 4 des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques .\n[648] La Commission a \u00e9galement fourni un document qu'elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et qui comprenait des descriptions des caract\u00e9ristiques de connaissances et de qualifications, de r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes, de responsabilit\u00e9 et conditions de travail des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . Enfin, l'\u00c9quipe a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une gamme de manuels d'utilisation de Postes Canada, de guides postaux et de documents \u00e0 l'appui.\n[649] Apr\u00e8s les \u00e9valuations effectu\u00e9es en 1993\/1994 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle de postes CR et d'emplois PO, on a trouv\u00e9, en 1997, de nouveaux documents CR qui comprenaient de nombreuses descriptions, pas toutes cependant, de postes manquants. Toutefois, M. Wolf, au nom de l'\u00c9quipe, a conclu que ces documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n'\u00e9taient pas assez importants pour que l'on r\u00e9\u00e9value les \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures faites par l'\u00c9quipe.\n[650] En l'an 2000, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a entrepris un examen de l'incidence possible, sur les \u00e9valuations des emplois qu'elle a faites en 1993\/1994, de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal, durant la p\u00e9riode de 1995 \u00e0 2000, par un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada.\n[651] Ces nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve consistaient en environ 4 000 pages de documents \u00e9crits, notamment des transcriptions d'un grand nombre de journ\u00e9es de t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal et en contre-interrogatoire concernant la nature du travail, surtout pour les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . Un nombre consid\u00e9rable de pi\u00e8ces justificatives ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, tels des manuels de Postes Canada, des guides ainsi que du mat\u00e9riel didactique. De nombreuses autres pi\u00e8ces justificatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises par l'Alliance et par la Commission.\n[652] M. Wolf a examin\u00e9 cette volumineuse documentation et a retir\u00e9 des documents qu'il estimait non pertinents \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Le reste a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans son ensemble. L'avocat de Postes Canada s'est demand\u00e9 si le rejet des documents avant que ceux-ci n'aient \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9s par ses deux coll\u00e8gues constituait une pratique acceptable.\n[653] M. Wolf a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lui et ses deux coll\u00e8gues avaient conclu que, d'apr\u00e8s ces nouveaux documents, chacun des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques d\u00e9crivait peu, sinon aucun, des nombreux titulaires de ces emplois. Un certain nombre, s'il en \u00e9tait, ex\u00e9cutaient l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches d\u00e9crites. En r\u00e9ponse, et en toute justice pour l'ensemble des titulaires d'emplois, M. Wolf et ses deux coll\u00e8gues ont choisi de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer les 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques en se fondant sur l'hypoth\u00e8se que l'ensemble des titulaires d'emplois ex\u00e9cutaient l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches respectives vis\u00e9es.\n[654] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a conclu que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n'avaient eu aucune incidence sur leurs \u00e9valuations des postes CR mais avaient eu une certaine incidence sur leurs \u00e9valuations des emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . Par exemple, M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] l'\u00e9tendue des t\u00e2ches dans l'un ou l'autre des emplois PO \u00e9tait beaucoup plus vaste que nous l'avions d'abord r\u00e9alis\u00e9. Les 10 emplois repr\u00e9sentent beaucoup plus que cela en r\u00e9alit\u00e9185.\n[655] M. Wolf a signal\u00e9 que plusieurs modifications dans les pointages des \u00e9valuations ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de la r\u00e9\u00e9valuation des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . Cinq des emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques n'ont subi aucune modification quant \u00e0 leurs pointages et trois emplois ont subi des modifications mineures de trois points ou moins. Deux emplois g\u00e9n\u00e9riques ont subi des modifications significatives quant \u00e0 leur pointage. L'emploi g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de commis au comptoir a vu son pointage augmenter alors que l'emploi g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de messager suppl\u00e9ant du service du courrier a vu son pointage diminuer.\n[656] Par cons\u00e9quent, les FAITS II ont fourni \u00e0 l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle un bon nombre de renseignements sur les emplois, de donn\u00e9es et de renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui se sont ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux fournis par les FAITS I. La question suivante se pose donc : \u00e0 quel point les renseignements sur les emplois et les renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux suppl\u00e9mentaires des FAITS II ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 utiles?\n[657] Chose certaine, ils ont ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la vision globale de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle quant \u00e0 la nature et quant au travail des groupes d'employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par la plainte. Alors qu'une bonne partie des nouveaux documents ne portaient uniquement que sur le groupe d'employ\u00e9s des op\u00e9rations postales (PO), il y avait des documents additionnels qui portaient sur la collectivit\u00e9 CR.\n[658] Par exemple, les notes d'entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques des employ\u00e9s CR de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle ont fourni de nouvelles informations qui ont permis de mettre en lumi\u00e8re le facteur des conditions de travail des postes CR vis\u00e9s.\n[659] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, M. Wolf a confirm\u00e9 que l'examen fait par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 1997 des nouveaux documents CR n'avait pas apport\u00e9 suffisamment de nouveaux renseignements pour que l'\u00c9quipe revoit ses \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures. Par ailleurs, l'examen par l'\u00c9quipe des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve provenant des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 1995 \u00e0 2000 a entra\u00een\u00e9 des modifications importantes quant aux pointages de deux des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques .\n[660] Tout compte fait, le Tribunal conclut que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayent l'opinion que bien qu'une bonne partie des nouveaux renseignements sur les emplois ainsi que des nouveaux renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui composaient les FAITS II n'aient pas apport\u00e9 une dimension nouvelle importante \u00e0 la base principale des renseignements sur les emplois de FAITS I, ils ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 augmenter et \u00e0 fortifier la compr\u00e9hension de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle des emplois et des postes \u00e0 \u00e9valuer.\nD. Les Faits I et les Faits II en comparaison avec la norme de fiabilit\u00e9 admise dans l'industrie de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois [661] Dans quelle mesure les renseignements et les donn\u00e9es sur les emplois de FAITS I et II, ont-ils satisfait \u00e0 la norme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise dans l'industrie de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit au paragraphe [596]? En d'autres mots, \u00e0 quel point les renseignements\/donn\u00e9es sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle (FAITS I et II) lorsqu'elle a effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations des emplois en 1993\/1994 (compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en 2000) \u00e9taient-ils raisonnablement pr\u00e9cis, raisonnablement coh\u00e9rents et raisonnablement complets?\n[662] Les lacunes, d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien document\u00e9es ci-dessus, figurant dans les descriptions des emplois, que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en est venue \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant ses documents de premi\u00e8re source quant aux postes CR sont, peut-\u00eatre, l'une des meilleures illustrations d'un manque g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pr\u00e9cision, de coh\u00e9rence et d'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. M. Wolf, lui-m\u00eame, a reconnu l'existence des nombreuses lacunes, notamment des descriptions de poste CR p\u00e9rim\u00e9es, incompl\u00e8tes, non officielles, voire m\u00eame manquantes.\n[663] Postes Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 appuy\u00e9e par M. Willis et par Mme Winter lorsqu'elle a fait des commentaires sur le manque de pr\u00e9cision, de coh\u00e9rence et d'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 dans un bon nombre des descriptions de poste CR et lorsqu'elle a soulign\u00e9 que, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, celle-ci ne comprenaient pas de renseignements sur les conditions de travail. M. Wallace a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son rapport que [Traduction] [...] les documents n'\u00e9taient pas complets et manquaient de coh\u00e9rence 186.\n[664] M\u00eame la Commission a fait la mise en garde suivante quant \u00e0 l'utilisation des descriptions d'emploi dans son livret sur la mise en uvre de la parit\u00e9 salariale:\n[...] les descriptions de t\u00e2ches ne doivent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es ou trait\u00e9es comme source exclusive ou m\u00eame principale de donn\u00e9es, puisqu'elles reproduisent souvent les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et qu'elles ne refl\u00e8tent pas toujours fid\u00e8lement le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 (paragraphe [358]).\n[665] Une incoh\u00e9rence s'est \u00e9galement produite dans l'utilisation du Guide d'entrevue quant aux titulaires de poste CR. Un certain nombre de modifications dans sa conception initiale, propos\u00e9es par un repr\u00e9sentant de l'Alliance, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par la Commission apr\u00e8s que l'on eut d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 les entrevues, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence dans le syst\u00e8me de deux versions du Guide.\n[666] Des questions d'incoh\u00e9rence et de manque d'exhaustivit\u00e9 ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es lors des t\u00e9moignages quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillon CR, lequel comprenait les superviseurs de niveau CR 5, alors que le sous-groupe des superviseurs PO avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 des emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques par la Commission. De m\u00eame, on a fait part d'un manque de coh\u00e9rence quant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence appr\u00e9ciable qui existait quant aux dates de collecte des renseignements - 1986 pour les postes CR et 1990\/1991 pour les emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . M. Willis, par exemple, a mentionn\u00e9 que l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es en cause dans l'\u00e9valuation des emplois devraient, id\u00e9alement, \u00eatre recueillies durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode et aussi pr\u00e8s que possible de la date d'ex\u00e9cution des \u00e9valuations des emplois. Il a estim\u00e9 que cela \u00e9tait important en raison du fait que les emplois avaient tendance \u00e0 changer avec le temps.\n[667] L'Alliance et la Commission n'ont pas vraiment trait\u00e9 directement de la norme de l'industrie qui exige l'atteinte d'une pr\u00e9cision, d'une coh\u00e9rence et d'une exhaustivit\u00e9 raisonnable des renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s lors de la r\u00e9alisation des \u00e9valuations. Les deux parties ont eu tendance \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter les t\u00e9moignages, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, de M. Willis et de M. Wallace au motif que ceux-ci n'avaient pas lu l'ensemble des documents pertinents et n'avaient pas effectu\u00e9 eux-m\u00eames les \u00e9valuations des postes CR et des emplois PO. Ils ont alors pr\u00e9tendu que les opinions de M. Willis et de M. Wallace \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des renseignements incomplets et devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. Comme seuls M. Wolf et ses deux coll\u00e8gues avaient examin\u00e9 l'ensemble des documents sur les emplois et avaient effectivement effectu\u00e9 des \u00e9valuations d'emplois, la Commission et l'Alliance ont demand\u00e9 avec insistance que les opinions de M. Wolf soient accept\u00e9es.\n[668] Fait int\u00e9ressant, M. Wolf a reconnu ouvertement l'existence d'exemples d'impr\u00e9cisions, d'incoh\u00e9rences et d'un manque d'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 dans les renseignements sur les emplois, ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus haut.\nE. Analyse du Tribunal : (i) Un d\u00e9fi de taille [669] En entreprenant cette derni\u00e8re analyse des renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal doit se rappeler les deux facteurs suivants dont il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[670] M. Wolf et M. Willis ont confirm\u00e9 que, lorsque l'on effectue des \u00e9valuations d'emploi, la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois et la compr\u00e9hension que l'on a des emplois sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments primordiaux et sont plus importants que le plan d'\u00e9valuation ou le processus vis\u00e9.\n[671] L'Alliance et la Commission ont choisi de se fier uniquement aux \u00e9valuations effectu\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle en 1993\/1994 (compl\u00e9t\u00e9es en 2000) pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. En effet, l'Alliance et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuations des emplois faites par la Commission en 1987 ainsi qu'en 1991 soient \u00e9cart\u00e9es au profit de celles effectu\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. On ne peut toutefois pas \u00e9carter le fait qu'une partie des documents de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe pour effectuer ses \u00e9valuations \u00e9tait, essentiellement, les renseignements que la Commission avait utilis\u00e9s dans ses \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures, c'est-\u00e0-dire les FAITS I.\n[672] L'appr\u00e9ciation par le Tribunal et le poids \u00e0 donner aux t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par chacune des parties et par les t\u00e9moins experts quant \u00e0 la question de la fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e un d\u00e9fi de taille.\n[673] Il ne fait gu\u00e8re de doute que les renseignements sur les emplois (FAITS I et II) employ\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle lorsqu'elle a effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations des emplois n'ont pas satisfait \u00e0 la norme \u00e0 laquelle on est normalement en droit de s'attendre dans le cadre d'une \u00e9tude conjointe employeur-employ\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Mais, compte tenu des circonstances quelque peu p\u00e9nibles et prolong\u00e9es de la pr\u00e9sente instance dont le Tribunal est saisi, les renseignements sur les emplois \u00e9taient-ils suffisants , selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, pour produire des pointages raisonnablement fiables quant aux emplois\/postes qui, \u00e0 leur tour, pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir s'il y avait oui ou non un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9num\u00e9ration?\n[674] M. Wolf, en tant que porte-parole de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, a reconnu que lui-m\u00eame et ses deux coll\u00e8gues avaient trouv\u00e9 de nombreuses lacunes dans les donn\u00e9es sur les emplois disponibles. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que leur compr\u00e9hension des emplois \u00e9tait [...] ad\u00e9quate mais pas n\u00e9cessairement id\u00e9ale [...] (paragraphe [484]).\n[675] Par ad\u00e9quate , le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser, au paragraphe [486], que l'on pourrait consid\u00e9rer le mot suffisante comme synonyme acceptable.\n[676] Le Tribunal voit peu d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 tenter de trouver un coupable quant aux renseignements sur les emplois imparfaits mais souligne que l'avocat de l'Alliance, \u00e0 la fin de sa plaidoirie, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nSi nous ne poss\u00e9dons pas une image id\u00e9ale du travail de PO, je vous dis que cela est d\u00fb en grande partie aux d\u00e9cisions prises par Postes Canada187.\n[677] En m\u00eame temps, le Tribunal souligne que l'article 43 de la Loi accorde \u00e0 la Commission certains pouvoirs quant \u00e0 l'obtention des documents pertinents de la part d'un intim\u00e9 lorsqu'elle m\u00e8ne son enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal accepte que la Commission, et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame le plaignant, pourraient aussi \u00eatre tenus en partie responsables pour la condition des renseignements sur les emplois disponibles en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[678] Un autre aspect qui, selon le Tribunal, m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9, et sur lequel l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle n'a eu aucune participation directe, est l'\u00e9chantillon CR. Alors que les positions contradictoires des t\u00e9moins experts, M. Bellhouse et M. Kervin, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, il est utile de souligner la plaidoirie finale suivante pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'avocat de l'Alliance qui ajoute une autre dimension \u00e0 cette question :\n[Traduction]\nJe soulignerai un facteur dont vous pouvez toutefois tenir compte, et c'est lorsque l'on examine les donn\u00e9es, l'une des choses qui m'a frapp\u00e9, le caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif des donn\u00e9es, on retourne \u00e0 la cause fondamentale des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9chantillon CR et le probl\u00e8me provient du fait que Postes Canada a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission une liste des employ\u00e9s p\u00e9rim\u00e9e. C'est l'origine de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la recherche d'autres employ\u00e9s.\nJe ne vous dirai pas que la Commission n'a pas commis de faute, et il en va de m\u00eame pour Postes Canada. Il serait certainement in\u00e9quitable pour Postes Canada de se pr\u00e9senter maintenant devant le Tribunal et d'affirmer que l'on ne peut pas se fier sur les donn\u00e9es alors qu'elle \u00e9tait responsable de fournir des renseignements \u00e0 la Commission188.\n[679] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir si oui ou non les renseignements sur les emplois \u00e9taient raisonnablement fiables, le Tribunal a trouv\u00e9 l'extrait suivant utile :\nTraduction]\nPar contre, en droit anglo-canadien, [...] les tribunaux ont statu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on constante que dans les cas o\u00f9 la partie demanderesse \u00e9tablit qu'une perte a probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 subie, la difficult\u00e9 d'en d\u00e9terminer le montant ne peut jamais permettre \u00e0 l'auteur du pr\u00e9judice de se soustraire au paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Si ce montant est difficile \u00e0 estimer, le tribunal doit simplement faire de son mieux \u00e0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il dispose ; \u00e9videmment, si la partie demanderesse n'a pas produit une preuve dont on aurait pu s'attendre qu'elle soit produite si la demande \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, son omission sera interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en sa d\u00e9faveur.\nDans Ratcliffe c. Evans, le juge Bower a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nOn doit insister sur le plus de certitude et le plus de particularit\u00e9 possible lorsque l'on plaide l'existence d'un pr\u00e9judice, comme il est raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances et de la nature des gestes eux-m\u00eames par lesquels le pr\u00e9judice est caus\u00e9. Insister sur moins \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 assouplir de vieux principes clairs. Insister sur plus \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 de la p\u00e9danterie inutile189.\n[680] Bien que l'extrait susmentionn\u00e9 ait trait au droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile d\u00e9lictuelle, le Tribunal estime qu'il porte sur une approche qui est peut-\u00eatre semblable \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal estime \u00eatre le spectre de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 accept\u00e9 (paragraphe [596]) que la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable devrait s'appliquer lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9tablir la fiabilit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois choisi, du processus suivi et des renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s. La norme absolue de la d\u00e9cision correcte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, comme d'ailleurs le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Winter, et ce, pour les m\u00eames motifs.\n[681] L'ouvrage du professeur Waddams, susmentionn\u00e9, auquel, fait int\u00e9ressant, la Commission et l'Alliance ont renvoy\u00e9 dans le contexte de leurs observations quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration, parle de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour un tribunal, lorsqu'il fixe des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de [Traduction] faire de son mieux avec les documents disponibles , parce que la difficult\u00e9 d'en fixer le montant ne peut jamais permettre \u00e0 l'auteur du pr\u00e9judice de se soustraire au paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats . La citation se poursuit en renvoyant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Ratcliffe c. Evans dans laquelle il est mentionn\u00e9 qu'insister sur plus qu'une certitude raisonnable lorsque l'on plaide l'existence d'un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 de la p\u00e9danterie inutile et insister sur moins \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 assouplir de vieux principes clairs 190.\n[682] En d'autres mots, l'absolutisme devrait probablement \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 aux deux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s du spectre. Une norme pure \u00e0 100 p. 100 de correctitude est inacceptable \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure du spectre, tout comme une norme \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure qui rejette tout simplement comme n'ayant aucune valeur. Cette conception d'un spectre est certainement pertinente quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable des documents utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre de la r\u00e9alisation des \u00e9valuations dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[683] Compte tenu des circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause et de la nature r\u00e9paratrice des lois sur les droits de la personne, laquelle nature appelle une interpr\u00e9tation large, lib\u00e9rale et \u00e0 caract\u00e8re final, le Tribunal conclut qu'une approche large et lib\u00e9rale comparable, qui fait appel \u00e0 l'analogie du spectre, convient \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable de renseignements sur les emplois. Bien que, il se peut que les renseignements sur les emplois ne rencontrent pas le degr\u00e9 de fiabilit\u00e9 qui est normalement exig\u00e9 dans une situation de parit\u00e9 salariale , sont-ils ad\u00e9quats , comme le pr\u00e9tend M. Wolf, pour la pr\u00e9sente situation? Subsidiairement, les renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, avec leurs diverses lacunes, doivent-ils \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s comme n'ayant aucune valeur et sans aucun fondement, comme le veut l'opinion de M. Willis?\n[684] Le Tribunal croit que c'est dans le contexte du processus complet d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, c'est-\u00e0-dire le plan d'\u00e9valuation choisi et, surtout les \u00e9valuateurs impliqu\u00e9s, que l'on peut le mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions.\n[685] Compte tenu de la tr\u00e8s grande exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois de M. Wolf et de M. Ingster de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, notamment de leur grande exp\u00e9rience de l'application, pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, du syst\u00e8me Hay \u00e0 une vaste gamme d'emplois comportant divers renseignements sur les emplois, le Tribunal estime que leurs opinions concernant la fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois disponibles \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement convaincants.\n[686] De plus, M. Wolf n'a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 relever des lacunes dans des instruments comme la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi et comme certaines descriptions d'emploi. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait capable de s'adapter \u00e0 la situation qui lui est soumise comme le d\u00e9montrent ses remarques concernant le fait qu'il faut faire preuve de s\u00e9lectivit\u00e9 lorsque l'on utilise les donn\u00e9es comprises dans la Feuille de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi (paragraphe [609]). De toute \u00e9vidence, il savait comment \u00e9viter les aspects les plus offensants de ce document. Lui et ses deux coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient donc, tr\u00e8s conscients des imperfections, notamment de certaines incoh\u00e9rences et m\u00eame d'un manque d'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, dans les renseignements sur les emplois, mais ont tout de m\u00eame conclu que les documents \u00e9taient ad\u00e9quats quant au travail effectu\u00e9 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[687] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9e par l'augmentation de la base de donn\u00e9es de FAITS I au moyen des documents de FAITS II. Les nouveaux renseignements sur les conditions de travail obtenus au moyen des entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques effectu\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des membres de l'\u00e9chantillon CR qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9s constitue un exemple. La r\u00e9\u00e9valuation, en l'an 2000, des 10 emplois PO g\u00e9n\u00e9riques fond\u00e9e sur de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus de la part d'un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada, laquelle r\u00e9\u00e9valuation a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en deux r\u00e9visions importantes du pointage des emplois, constitue un autre exemple.\n[688] En r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par l'avocat de l'Alliance concernant son degr\u00e9 d'aisance avec les \u00e9valuations globales effectu\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, M. Wolf a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit, insinuant que les renseignements sur les emplois \u00e9taient \u00e0 tout le moins ad\u00e9quats :\n[Traduction]\nJ'estime que ces \u00e9valuations sont des repr\u00e9sentations valables des emplois particuliers en cause. Je n'aurais pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 l'emploi si j'avais estim\u00e9 que nous ne pouvions pas l'\u00e9valuer d'une mani\u00e8re valable et appropri\u00e9e. Nous avons \u00e9cart\u00e9 les quatre emplois parce que nous estimions que nous ne pouvions pas \u00e9valuer ces emplois avec pr\u00e9cision191.\n[689] Le Tribunal doit avouer que naviguer au travers des renseignements sur les emplois par les d\u00e9troits de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un exercice de tout repos. Cependant, en \u00e9valuant la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'ensemble des parties et les t\u00e9moins experts, et en vertu des circonstances uniques de l'esp\u00e8ce dans le domaine des motifs de distinction illicite des lois sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal conclut que les renseignements sur les emplois qui \u00e9taient entre les mains de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, \u00e9taient, selon toute vraisemblance, raisonnablement fiables ou ad\u00e9quats comme l'\u00c9quipe les a d\u00e9crits, et ce, malgr\u00e9 certaines imperfections.\n(ii) Les d\u00e9finitions et les sous-fourchettes d'acceptabilit\u00e9 [690] Reconnaissant l'importance de cette conclusion, le Tribunal d\u00e9sire consigner comment il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter ce qu'il consid\u00e8re \u00eatre l'un des aspects les plus complexes de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Pour l'aider \u00e0 analyser les nombreux aspects des renseignements sur les emplois disponibles et \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable de ces renseignements, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9examiner les d\u00e9finitions avec lesquelles il a travaill\u00e9.\n[691] D'abord, l'expression utilis\u00e9e par M. Wolf lorsqu'il a d\u00e9crit la compr\u00e9hension du travail de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle comme \u00e9tant [...] ad\u00e9quate mais pas n\u00e9cessairement id\u00e9ale [...] . Au paragraphe [485], le Tribunal a extrait les d\u00e9finitions du mot ad\u00e9quat figurant dans les dictionnaires Webster et Oxford. Les deux dictionnaires comprenaient notamment le mot suffisant parmi leurs d\u00e9finitions du mot ad\u00e9quat . \u00c0 leur tour, les deux dictionnaires ont d\u00e9fini le mot suffisant comme ad\u00e9quat ou assez . Le mot id\u00e9al est d\u00e9fini dans le dictionnaire Webster comme [Traduction] une norme de perfection ou d'excellence et dans le dictionnaire Oxford comme con\u00e7u comme parfait dans son genre .\n[692] Comment ces d\u00e9finitions se comparent-elles \u00e0 la signification de raisonnablement fiable ? Webster d\u00e9finit le mot raisonnable comme [Traduction] ne d\u00e9passant pas les limites prescrites par la raison, non exag\u00e9r\u00e9, mod\u00e9r\u00e9 . Oxford d\u00e9finit le mot raisonnable comme [Traduction] n'allant pas au-del\u00e0 de la limite prescrite par la raison, non extravagant, non exag\u00e9r\u00e9, mod\u00e9r\u00e9 . Webster d\u00e9finit fiable comme [Traduction] constamment digne de confiance en r\u00e9putation, jugements, rendements ou r\u00e9sultats . Oxford d\u00e9finit fiable comme [Traduction] en quoi on peut faire confiance, digne de confiance, sans danger, s\u00fbr .\n[693] Des renseignements sur les emplois raisonnablement fiables peuvent donc \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des renseignements sur les emplois qui sont constamment relativement fiables ou dans lesquelles on peut avoir une confiance mod\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les mots ad\u00e9quat et suffisant sont interchangeables. Alors que certaines personnes estiment que les mots constamment, relativement fiable ou confiance mod\u00e9r\u00e9e sont plus exigeants en ce qui concerne le niveau de qualit\u00e9 que les mots ad\u00e9quat ou suffisant , le Tribunal a conclu que, dans la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce, ils \u00e9taient, dans l'ensemble, \u00e9quivalents.\n[694] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'expression raisonnablement fiable et les mots ad\u00e9quat et suffisant comme \u00e9tant interchangeables aux fins de l'\u00e9tablissement de l'\u00e9tat de la fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois disponibles en l'esp\u00e8ce. De toute \u00e9vidence, le mot id\u00e9al fixe une norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte qui se situe au-del\u00e0 de la norme de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable .\n[695] Ayant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la terminologie r\u00e9gissant la norme de fiabilit\u00e9, le Tribunal a conclu que, selon toute vraisemblance, il n'y a pas un seul point pr\u00e9cis qui repr\u00e9sente la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable ou la fiabilit\u00e9 ad\u00e9quate . Au contraire, selon toute vraisemblance, une fourchette d'acceptabilit\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente ce qu'on entend par fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable ou ad\u00e9quate . Un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments candidats peuvent mieux cadrer que d'autres \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de cette fourchette, mais tous ceux qui passent le test d'entr\u00e9e sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant raisonnablement, ad\u00e9quatement ou suffisamment fiables.\n[696] Bien que le Tribunal e\u00fbt conclu qu'il est difficile, et probablement imprudent, de tenter d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis quantitativement quant \u00e0 la largeur de la fourchette d'acceptabilit\u00e9, il a conclu qu'il est utile, au point de vue administratif, de penser en fonction de trois sous-fourchettes possibles. La premi\u00e8re sous-fourchette repr\u00e9sente les percentiles sup\u00e9rieurs de la fourchette, la deuxi\u00e8me sous-fourchette repr\u00e9sente le percentile mitoyen et la troisi\u00e8me sous-fourchette repr\u00e9sente les percentiles inf\u00e9rieurs. Le Tribunal a appel\u00e9 ceux-ci, respectivement, fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure , fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable m\u00e9diane et fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure .\n[697] En effectuant son \u00e9tude de l'\u00e9norme quantit\u00e9 de documents et de t\u00e9moignages de la pr\u00e9sente cause qui dure depuis beaucoup d'ann\u00e9es, le Tribunal en est venu \u00e0 penser que l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l'ensemble des parties dans une cause de parit\u00e9 salariale serait probablement atteinte lorsque la qualit\u00e9 des renseignements sur les emplois vis\u00e9s cadraient bien \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la sous-fourchette fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure . Plus le niveau de la sous-fourchette au sein de la fourchette de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable est \u00e9lev\u00e9, plus la qualit\u00e9 est \u00e9lev\u00e9e et plus les pointages \u00e9ventuels attribu\u00e9s aux emplois et aux postes vis\u00e9s sont pr\u00e9cis - du moins en th\u00e9orie.\n[698] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que les trois sous-fourchettes satisfassent au crit\u00e8re de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable , la sous-fourchette sup\u00e9rieure satisfait davantage au crit\u00e8re et devrait, selon le Tribunal, \u00eatre le premier choix dans une situation relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[699] \u00c0 ce moment-ci, le Tribunal s'est demand\u00e9, dans quelle sous-fourchette placerait-il les renseignements sur les emplois que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a utilis\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce? Compte tenu du nombre de r\u00e9serves et d'imperfections dans les renseignements sur les emplois disponibles d\u00e9j\u00e0 constat\u00e9es dans l'examen qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal a conclu que les renseignements ne pouvaient \u00eatre ais\u00e9ment consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme appartenant \u00e0 la sous-fourchette sup\u00e9rieure de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable . Le Tribunal n'\u00e9tait pas non plus dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que les renseignements sur les emplois cadraient bien dans la sous-fourchette m\u00e9diane de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable . Le Tribunal a toutefois convenu que la place qui convenait le mieux aux renseignements sur les emplois \u00e9tait la sous-fourchette inf\u00e9rieure de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable .\n[700] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal a conclu que, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe [689], selon toute vraisemblance, les renseignements sur les emplois utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle lorsqu'elle a effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations des postes\/emplois CR et PO pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9taient raisonnablement fiables, bien que situ\u00e9s au niveau de la sous-fourchette inf\u00e9rieure de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable .\nVII. L'\u00c9CART DE R\u00c9MUN\u00c9RATION ET M\u00c9THODE DE RAJUSTEMENT DES SALAIRES A. Contexte [701] Ayant conclu, selon toute vraisemblance, que la m\u00e9thode Hay ordinaire , laquelle est utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre de la m\u00e9thode traditionnelle de comparaison des facteurs, que le processus suivi ainsi que les renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle lorsqu'elle a effectu\u00e9 ses \u00e9valuations des postes\/emplois CR et PO \u00e9taient raisonnablement fiables, les prochaines questions que l'on doit maintenant aborder sont les suivantes :\nDans quelle mesure les valeurs des \u00e9valuations des emplois attribu\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle aux postes CR et aux emplois PO concern\u00e9s \u00e9taient-elles fiables?\nA-t-on fait la preuve de l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et les groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes?\n[702] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli que les trois membres de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, dont il a soulign\u00e9 les comp\u00e9tences au paragraphe [382], \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles. M. Wolf a notamment \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d'expert du processus Hay en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des emplois et du processus Hay en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[703] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que, selon toute vraisemblance, le processus Hay ainsi que les renseignements sur les emplois raisonnablement fiables susmentionn\u00e9s, entre les mains d'\u00e9valuateurs comp\u00e9tents, comme l'\u00e9taient les membres de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, permettraient l'attribution de valeurs d'\u00e9valuation des emplois raisonnablement fiables aux travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par les employ\u00e9s CR et par les employ\u00e9s PO.\n[704] Dans son rapport final, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a conclu ce qui suit quant \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation Hay :\n[Traduction]\nAyant conclu qu'une partie importante des postes CR sont d'une valeur \u00e9gale ou plus grande que celle des emplois PO, la prochaine \u00e9tape logique \u00e9tait l'identification de la nature de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, entre les emplois PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les emplois CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine192.\n[705] En comparant les valeurs des \u00e9valuations des postes CR et des emplois PO avec les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration horaire des postes CR et des emplois PO, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son rapport (Pi\u00e8ce AFPC-30) qu'elle avait fait ces comparaisons pour chacune des trois ann\u00e9es suivantes : 1983, l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e; 1989, l'ann\u00e9e que la Commission a utilis\u00e9e pour son analyse de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et, 1995, l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 le rapport de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration horaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par l'Alliance et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s justes. Le taux le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 dans tous les cas.\n[706] Comme m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a utilis\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe dans laquelle une courbe de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin a \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9e et \u00e0 laquelle on a compar\u00e9 les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin. L'\u00c9quipe a utilis\u00e9 cette m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe parce qu'il s'agit d'une comparaison indirecte fr\u00e9quemment utilis\u00e9e dans les causes de parit\u00e9 salariale dans lesquelles de grands organismes sont impliqu\u00e9s par opposition \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode directe de comparaison emploi par emploi. La courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin repr\u00e9sente un mod\u00e8le des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Elle est trac\u00e9e sur un graphique \u00e0 partir des pointages totaux des \u00e9valuations des emplois figurant sur un axe du graphique et des salaires figurant sur l'autre axe. Une fois que cela est fait, le point d'intersection entre les pointages des \u00e9valuations et les salaires pour les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s graphiquement de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, est compar\u00e9 \u00e0 la courbe des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine \u00e0 des points d'intersection pr\u00e9cis.\n[707] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a con\u00e7u huit courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rentes des personnes de sexe masculin qu'elle a appel\u00e9es m\u00e9thodes A \u00e0 H inclusivement. Elle a notamment con\u00e7u une courbe pour chacun des emplois PO-INT (m\u00e9thode A) et pour chacun des emplois PO-EXT (m\u00e9thode B) ainsi qu'une moyenne des emplois PO-INT et des emplois EXT (m\u00e9thode E) pour chacune des trois ann\u00e9es choisies. Une comparaison emploi par emploi ou un appariement de postes comme l'\u00c9quipe l'a appel\u00e9e (m\u00e9thode H) a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[708] Les analyses faites par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des emplois PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et des postes CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, peu importe la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe utilis\u00e9e. Un r\u00e9sultat semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu avec la m\u00e9thode de l' appariement des postes . Ces conclusions valaient pour chacune des ann\u00e9es 1983, 1989, et 1995.\n[709] L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a conclu ce qui suit : [Traduction] toutes ces m\u00e9thodes r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l'existence d'un \u00e9cart important entre les salaires vers\u00e9s aux CR et ceux vers\u00e9s aux PO qui ex\u00e9cutent un travail de valeur \u00e9gale 193. Bien que les diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodes aient donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents quant \u00e0 l'importance des \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a qualifi\u00e9 ces diff\u00e9rences de [Traduction] relativement mineures .\n[710] D'un point de vue de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, l'opinion d'expert de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9tait que la meilleure mesure de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les emplois\/postes PO et CR \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e par la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration PO-INT (m\u00e9thode A) ou par la m\u00e9thode de l' appariement de postes (m\u00e9thode H). L'\u00c9quipe croyait qu'il en \u00e9tait ainsi parce que les emplois INT \u00e9taient ce qui se rapprochait le plus des postes CR compte tenu de la nature des fonctions.\nB. Les observations des parties (i) L'Alliance [711] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que lorsque l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est constat\u00e9, il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider quelle m\u00e9thode est la plus appropri\u00e9e pour \u00e9liminer cet \u00e9cart entre les CR et les PO. Elle a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que la m\u00e9thode la plus efficace pour \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart est la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires .\n[712] Sur les huit courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin trac\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, la m\u00e9thode favoris\u00e9e par l'Alliance \u00e9tait celle du rajustement \u00e0 la moyenne des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration INT et EXT - la m\u00e9thode E - parce que l'Alliance estimait qu'elle repr\u00e9sentait mieux les pratiques salariales des groupes de comparaison \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle favorisait la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration INT (m\u00e9thode A) bien qu'elle ait accept\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode E \u00e9tait aussi valable.\n[713] Le t\u00e9moin de l'Alliance, M. Terrence Ranger, dont le t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu en novembre 1995, a appuy\u00e9 la position de l'Alliance. L'Alliance n'a pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de qualifier M. Ranger de t\u00e9moin expert.\n[714] Au moment o\u00f9 il a rendu son t\u00e9moignage, M. Ranger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de l'Alliance comme chef de section de la recherche \u00e0 la Division de la n\u00e9gociation collective. Cette section comprenait six agents de recherche qui ont si\u00e9g\u00e9 sur des \u00e9quipes de n\u00e9gociation et qui ont fourni du soutien d'arri\u00e8re-plan pour les revendications. Ces agents ont effectu\u00e9 une analyse de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dans le domaine de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe ainsi que dans le domaine des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices marginaux comme les r\u00e9gimes de pension, les r\u00e9gimes d'assurance-dentaire et les r\u00e9gimes d'assurance-maladie. M. Ranger a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par l'Alliance en 1976 comme agent principal de recherche. Il a confirm\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin devant le tribunal qui a entendu la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor194. Dans cette cause, on lui avait demand\u00e9 de calculer les sommes exig\u00e9es pour \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dont l'existence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par l'un des conseillers en statistiques qui avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans cette cause.\n[715] M. Ranger a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait examin\u00e9 les rapports de M. Lee195 et de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle196 et qu'il avait comme objectif d'\u00e9valuer, pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la plainte, le co\u00fbt des paiements qui seraient n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9liminer les \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans ses huit diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodes. Comme les calculs de l'\u00c9quipe se limitaient aux ann\u00e9es 1983, 1989 et 1995, M. Ranger a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait produit des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9es sur la m\u00e9thode de l'\u00c9quipe pour chacune des ann\u00e9es 1981 \u00e0 1995. L'ann\u00e9e de d\u00e9part 1981 est l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 Postes Canada est devenue une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat. M. Ranger a utilis\u00e9 ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe annuels \u00e9quivalents pour chaque p\u00e9riode de 12 mois et a exclu les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations indirectes de ses calculs, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de M. Lee.\n[716] En effet, M. Ranger a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait reproduit ce que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait fait en utilisant la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode mais en y ajoutant le nombre d'employ\u00e9s. S'il avait bien compris, il s'agissait des chiffres de Postes Canada, lesquels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus par l'Alliance ou tir\u00e9s directement de l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. Pour les ann\u00e9es 1981 \u00e0 1985, il a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le nombre d'employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient le m\u00eame que pour 1986. M. Ranger a ensuite multipli\u00e9 l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration constat\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans chacune des huit m\u00e9thodes, par le nombre d'heures de travail par ann\u00e9e et par le nombre d'employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s.\n[717] La conclusion de M. Ranger \u00e9tait que la m\u00e9thode E de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle - la moyenne des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin INT et EXT - produisait la meilleure repr\u00e9sentation de la population du groupe de comparaison et, par cons\u00e9quent, la mesure corrective la plus ad\u00e9quate en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il a reconnu que les co\u00fbts du paiement seraient moindres en vertu de la m\u00e9thode E qu'en vertu de la m\u00e9thode A favoris\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[718] M. Ranger a soulign\u00e9 que les donn\u00e9es sur la population des employ\u00e9s qu'il a utilis\u00e9es devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des estimations car ces donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 des points pr\u00e9cis dans le temps et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'elles se rapportaient \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein pour la p\u00e9riode enti\u00e8re de 12 mois. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il se peut qu'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein n'occupaient pas un poste donn\u00e9 pendant chacun des 12 mois de l'ann\u00e9e et on croit qu'un certain nombre d'entre eux \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon M. Ranger, cela aurait une incidence sur son estimation des co\u00fbts.\n[719] M. Ranger a ensuite t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le montant du paiement total possible aux employ\u00e9s CR quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, lequel montant, selon ses calculs, serait l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que 124 million de dollars (\u00e0 l'exclusion des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations indirectes ), devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une estimation et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame comme [Traduction] [...] une estimation jug\u00e9e \u00e9lev\u00e9e .\n[720] M. Ranger a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nJe ne veux pas laisser entendre que le co\u00fbt du r\u00e8glement sera de 124 millions de dollars; il s'agit d'une certaine approximation du co\u00fbt total de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, mais je ne crois pas que personne ici pourrait en arriver \u00e0 ce montant. Je crois que ce qui devrait \u00eatre circonscrits sont les montants horaires qui sont exig\u00e9s, puis chaque employ\u00e9 recevra le montant qui lui est d\u00fb en fonction de ces montants horaires et du temps qu'il a travaill\u00e9 durant la p\u00e9riode. En fait, personne ne conna\u00eetra le co\u00fbt final que lorsque tout ceci aura \u00e9t\u00e9 fait197.\n[721] Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat de Postes Canada, M. Ranger a convenu que tout rajustement en cas de parit\u00e9 salariale serait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards . Il a expliqu\u00e9 que cela signifiait que le rajustement comprendrait \u00e9galement toute remise prescrite par la loi que Postes Canada pourrait devoir faire en raison du rajustement de base. Il a donn\u00e9 des exemples comme les obligations de l'employeur touchant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme la pension de retraite, l'assurance-emploi, et la taxe en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9. Bien que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments augmenteraient les co\u00fbts de Postes Canada, ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 quantifi\u00e9s par M. Ranger.\n[722] L'Alliance appuie vigoureusement le concept de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards et a pr\u00e9tendu que les montants payables aux CR pour \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration doivent \u00eatre class\u00e9s dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. Des rajustements appropri\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre faits afin de refl\u00e9ter le co\u00fbt de ces remises prescrites par la loi.\n[723] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 davantage par l'avocat de Postes Canada, M. Ranger a confirm\u00e9 que, aux fins de ses calculs de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, il avait utilis\u00e9 le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration maximum figurant dans le bar\u00e8me des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9vus quant \u00e0 un poste ou \u00e0 un emploi donn\u00e9. Bien que des postes ou des emplois avec des points d'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9cis sont r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s selon des tranches de salaire pr\u00e9cises et que les titulaires de ces postes peuvent gagner des salaires diff\u00e9rents dans une tranche donn\u00e9e, et ce, en fonction du temps qu'ils ont occup\u00e9 ce poste ou cet emploi, aux fins de sa quantification du co\u00fbt de l'\u00e9limination de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, M. Ranger a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que chaque emploi ou chaque poste \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 selon le niveau le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 permis.\n[724] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que le principe de l' inclusion devrait \u00eatre mis en application au moment du rajustement des salaires visant \u00e0 \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. La pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait que, \u00e0 la date de la d\u00e9cision finale du Tribunal, un rajustement serait apport\u00e9 aux taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de base pr\u00e9vus dans la convention collective des CR de telle sorte que, pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, les salaires des CR seraient les m\u00eames que les salaires des PO. Le rajustement serait inclus dans le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de base des CR.\n[725] Comme solution de rechange \u00e0 l'adh\u00e9sion de M. Ranger \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que la m\u00e9thode fond\u00e9e sur l'emploi de M. Kervin serait acceptable en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'Alliance a estim\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin produisait des \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 celles relev\u00e9es par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et par M. Ranger.\n[726] En conclusion, l'Alliance a affirm\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tablissement du co\u00fbt final r\u00e9el de l'\u00e9limination des \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration demandera plus de travail. Par exemple, un examen des dossiers des employ\u00e9s d\u00e9tenus par Postes Canada sera n\u00e9cessaire. De plus, les modifications faites en juin 2000 par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle quant \u00e0 certaines \u00e9valuations d'emploi PO, lesquelles modifications d\u00e9coulaient des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada, auront une incidence sur les calculs de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Ces modifications figurent dans le rapport AFPC-180 de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n(ii) La Commission [727] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu'il est justifi\u00e9 d'accorder un montant pour perte de salaire afin de r\u00e9gler la question de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, entre les groupes d'employ\u00e9s CR et les groupes d'employ\u00e9s PO, l'existence duquel \u00e9cart a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en l'esp\u00e8ce. La Commission a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires la plus appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 utiliser dans le calcul de cette indemnit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re est la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe dans laquelle on se sert d'une courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration combin\u00e9e des personnes de sexe masculin comme dans la m\u00e9thode E de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[728] La Commission a soulign\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des causes de parit\u00e9 salariale qui sont de nature syst\u00e9mique font intervenir des groupes professionnels qui ne se pr\u00eatent pas toujours \u00e0 des comparaisons directes de la valeur du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. En l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les emplois des sous-groupes PO-INT et PO-EXT ne comportent pas de comparateurs directs pour les postes CR, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 15 de l'ordonnance de 1986, une comparaison indirecte entre le travail des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin et le travail des personnes de sexe masculin doit \u00eatre faite. Selon la Commission, cette comparaison indirecte comporte l'\u00e9laboration d'une courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin \u00e0 l'aide de l'analyse de la r\u00e9gression.\n[729] La Commission a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'une telle comparaison indirecte, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires niveau\/courbe, serait compatible avec ce que M. Wolf, M. Kervin et M. Ranger ont recommand\u00e9. Elle serait \u00e9galement compatible avec la m\u00e9thode choisie dans la cause Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor198.\n[730] Selon la Commission, la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin, devrait combiner l'ensemble des donn\u00e9es disponibles sur les personnes de sexe masculin. La meilleure fa\u00e7on d'y arriver est d'utiliser la m\u00e9thode E, laquelle fait partie des choix de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. Ce choix correspondrait aux choix faits par M. Kervin et par M. Ranger et est conforme \u00e0 l'article 14 de l'ordonnance de 1986. Cet article mentionne que lorsqu'une comparaison est faite entre le groupe professionnel qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte all\u00e9guant une disparit\u00e9 salariale et d'autres groupes professionnels, ces autres groupes sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un seul groupe.\n[731] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires la plus appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la valeur des emplois des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin \u00e9tait la m\u00e9thode fond\u00e9e sur un niveau plut\u00f4t que la m\u00e9thode fond\u00e9e sur une courbe de salaire des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin, d'o\u00f9 l'appellation niveau\/courbe. M. Wolf et M. Ranger ont fond\u00e9 leur niveau des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin sur la moyenne des r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations des postes existant au sein de chacun des niveaux CR.\n[732] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que, bien que ni elle, ni l'Alliance, n'\u00e9taient capables de d\u00e9cider quels postes comprenaient les emplois compris dans l'\u00e9chantillon CR, Postes Canada, en mai 1999, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, par le biais de son t\u00e9moin M. Brian Wilson, un rapport sur le regroupement en emplois des postes CR \u00e9valu\u00e9s199. M. Wilson, un retrait\u00e9 de Postes Canada depuis 1995, a pass\u00e9 plus de 30 ans au service de la compagnie. Il a d'abord travaill\u00e9 comme facteur, puis il a progressivement gravi les \u00e9chelons pour devenir superviseur et gestionnaire aux relations de travail et aux ressources humaines.\n[733] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que M. Mark Killingsworth, un autre t\u00e9moin de Postes Canada, a ensuite \u00e9tabli les valeurs moyennes de ces emplois en utilisant les postes CR \u00e9valu\u00e9s avec leur pr\u00e9dominance de tel ou tel sexe qui figuraient dans les documents de M. Wilson. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que c'est gr\u00e2ce aux d\u00e9terminations de M. Killingsworth que M. Kervin, le t\u00e9moin de l'Alliance, a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de fournir son avis d'expert quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de calculer les rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale niveau\/courbe.\n[734] M. Killingsworth a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 par le Tribunal de t\u00e9moin expert en \u00e9conomique du travail, notamment en \u00e9conom\u00e9trie. Il a obtenu un baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts en \u00e9conomique avec grande distinction \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 du Michigan en 1967. Il a ensuite \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 d'Oxford gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une bourse de la fondation Rhodes. Il y a obtenu un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9conomique en 1969 et un doctorat en \u00e9conomique en 1977. Au moment de sa premi\u00e8re comparution devant le Tribunal en mai 1999, il \u00e9tait professeur d'\u00e9conomique \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Rutgers (New Jersey), un poste qu'il occupe depuis 1988. Il a \u00e9galement travaill\u00e9 comme \u00e9conomiste charg\u00e9 de recherches au National Bureau of Economic Research, poste qu'il a occup\u00e9 depuis 1984. Il est l'auteur d'un certain nombre de publications sur la valeur comparable (le terme am\u00e9ricain pour parit\u00e9 salariale ) et a effectu\u00e9 de nombreuses recherches dans ce domaine ainsi que dans des domaines connexes.\n[735] La Commission a favoris\u00e9 l'analyse du M. Kervin \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle comportait l'utilisation des emplois CR plut\u00f4t que l'utilisation des postes CR. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que de nombreux experts ont convenu que ce sont les emplois qui constituent l'unit\u00e9 d'analyse privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e dans le cadre des \u00e9tudes en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . Un emploi est un ensemble de t\u00e2ches g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par de nombreux employ\u00e9s occupant des postes .\n[736] Que la m\u00e9thode des emplois ou des postes ait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour calculer le niveau des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'utiliser en l'esp\u00e8ce la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe. Elle pr\u00e9sume toutefois que chaque niveau est fond\u00e9 sur un \u00e9chantillon repr\u00e9sentatif d'emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. La Commission a rappel\u00e9 au Tribunal que l'opinion d'expert de M. Kervin \u00e9tait que l'\u00e9chantillon CR \u00e9tait suffisamment repr\u00e9sentatif.\n[737] Dans ses pr\u00e9tentions la Commission a soulign\u00e9 l'utilisation du plan Hay dans lequel les postes CR \u00e9chantillonn\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on al\u00e9atoire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s en conformit\u00e9 avec les quatre facteurs que sont les qualifications, les efforts, les responsabilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour l'ex\u00e9cution du travail, compte tenu des conditions de travail, lesquels facteurs figurent au paragraphe 11(2) de la Loi. Il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 la tranche de valeurs des emplois pour chacun des niveaux CR.\n[738] La Commission a conclu que la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin ainsi que celle de M. Ranger, lesquelles comportaient toutes les deux une courbe composite de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin, \u00e9taient les plus appropri\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a soumis, pour les ann\u00e9es 1981 \u00e0 2002, deux ensembles de calculs de rajustements exig\u00e9s quant \u00e0 chaque niveau CR pour atteindre un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale.\n[739] Le premier calcul a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin dans laquelle celui-ci a utilis\u00e9 les valeurs des \u00e9valuations des emplois de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et avec laquelle il a relev\u00e9 l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour l'ann\u00e9e 1995. \u00c0 partir de cette ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, la Commission a extrapol\u00e9 les \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations pour chacune des autres ann\u00e9es. Le deuxi\u00e8me calcul \u00e9tait celui de M. Ranger dont la d\u00e9termination de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration par niveau de CR par ann\u00e9e \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[740] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration utilis\u00e9s dans ses calculs de rajustement de salaire \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur les taux figurant dans les conventions collectives pertinentes. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les ann\u00e9es 1981 \u00e0 1994 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport de M. Ranger. Les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour 1995 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extraits des rapports de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. Les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les ann\u00e9es 1996 \u00e0 2002 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 directement extraits des conventions collectives par la Commission, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ni l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, ni M. Kervin n'ont fourni aucun calcul quant aux ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1995.\n[741] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que bien que les calculs de M. Kervin ainsi que ceux de M. Ranger produisaient des estimations satisfaisantes de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait les estimations de rajustement de salaire de M. Kervin. Les motifs pour cette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence comprenaient l'utilisation par M. Kervin de la valeur moyenne de l'emploi dans chaque niveau CR par opposition \u00e0 la valeur moyenne du poste utilis\u00e9e par l'\u00e9quipe de M. Wolf. La Commission a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que les calculs de M. Kervin \u00e9taient plus pr\u00e9cis et plus r\u00e9cents que ceux de M. Ranger.\n[742] La Commission a reconnu que les deux ensembles de calculs ne repr\u00e9sentaient que des estimations de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et que la d\u00e9termination des paiements r\u00e9els pour les employ\u00e9s CR doit, in\u00e9luctablement, faire l'objet d'un examen des dossiers des employ\u00e9s avec la participation pertinente de l'employeur.\n[743] Bien que la Commission ait pr\u00e9tendu que les tribunaux ne d\u00e9terminent pas les paiements individuels totaux, le Tribunal, s'il estime que la d\u00e9termination des valeurs des emplois \u00e9valu\u00e9s est raisonnablement fiable, doit d\u00e9cider quelle m\u00e9thode de rajustement de salaire est appropri\u00e9e, compte tenu des circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[744] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle approuvait le principe de l' inclusion de l'Alliance selon lequel un rajustement d'arr\u00e9rages serait inclus dans les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de base pr\u00e9vus dans la convention collective des CR200.\n[745] La Commission a \u00e9galement approuv\u00e9 le concept de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards et a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] il est essentiel que les rajustements d'une parit\u00e9 salariale comprennent non seulement des rajustements au salaire de base, mais \u00e9galement des rajustements \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, c'est-\u00e0-dire, des rajustements aux r\u00e9gimes de retraite, aux heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, aux cong\u00e9s de maladie, aux r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations d'int\u00e9rim et aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e201.\n[746] La Commission a toutefois accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de M. Lee dans lequel celui-ci a conclu que, selon les contrats actuels des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein, il n'y avait pas de diff\u00e9rence importante entre les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices marginaux des CR et ceux des PO. M. Lee a examin\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences historiques pour les 12 ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures et a conclu qu'elles ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre calcul\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on fiable sans que l'on dispose d'un dossier complet sur l'exp\u00e9rience des employ\u00e9s, et ce, pour chaque b\u00e9n\u00e9fice marginal. Quant aux quelques diff\u00e9rences qui existaient, M. Lee a estim\u00e9 qu'elles \u00e9taient peu importantes et que, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, elles ne se traduisaient pas par une diff\u00e9rence de salaire importante aux fins de parit\u00e9 salariale . Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Lee a \u00e9mis l'opinion qu'il n'y avait pas de diff\u00e9rence globale dans les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices marginaux qui devraient \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul des rajustements de salaire qui seraient effectu\u00e9s en faveur des CR ou en faveur des PO.\n[747] La Commission a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que le fait que des emplois du sous-groupe PO-SUP aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus du groupe professionnel PO lors de l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate et lors du processus ult\u00e9rieur de parit\u00e9 salariale , n'avait aucune influence sur la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires.\n[748] La Commission a enjoint le Tribunal de demeurer saisi de l'affaire apr\u00e8s avoir soumis sa d\u00e9cision et d'aider les parties au besoin, et ce, au cas o\u00f9 on rencontrerait des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure dans la d\u00e9termination des d\u00e9tails des paiements individuels.\n(iii) Postes Canada [749] Postes Canada a fait valoir que la question de la r\u00e9paration, notamment la question de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires, n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e si le Tribunal devait trancher en faveur de Postes Canada et rejeter la plainte pour l'un ou plusieurs des motifs qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 invoqu\u00e9s. Toutefois, Postes Canada a choisi de r\u00e9pondre aux observations de l'Alliance et \u00e0 celles de la Commission touchant les composantes de la r\u00e9paration.\n[750] Postes Canada a fait valoir que l'importance d'un montant de r\u00e9paration et de son incidence sur l'ensemble des parties exige un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de confiance dans la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination des rajustements de salaire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, Postes Canada a estim\u00e9 que les calculs de rajustement de salaire de l'Alliance \u00e9taient [Traduction] exag\u00e9r\u00e9s en tout point . Postes Canada a estim\u00e9 que, selon la m\u00e9thode de M. Ranger, le montant total serait d'environ 2,4 milliards de dollars et d'environ 443 millions de dollars selon la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin.\n[751] Postes Canada a soulign\u00e9 que les observations de l'Alliance et les calculs de M. Ranger \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur l'analyse de rajustement des salaires de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, laquelle comprenait l'\u00e9laboration d'une courbe de r\u00e9gression pour les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine en ins\u00e9rant manuellement, \u00e0 vue, \u00e0 l'aide d'une r\u00e8gle, une courbe \u00e0 travers les points de donn\u00e9es PO. La courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue par extrapolation au del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es PO, ce qui, selon Postes Canada, est une technique qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e acceptable par la Division de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale de Travail Canada.\n[752] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'analyse de rajustement des salaires de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle comportait quatre lacunes importantes et que celles-ci la rendaient inad\u00e9quate en l'esp\u00e8ce comme base de calcul des rajustements de salaire appropri\u00e9s.\n[753] La premi\u00e8re lacune, selon Postes Canada, \u00e9tait l'insertion manuelle des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin. M. Wolf a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien qu'il existe une diff\u00e9rence d'opinion parmi les statisticiens quant au nombre minimum d'observations exig\u00e9 pour qu'une analyse de r\u00e9gression soit valable, la plupart estiment qu'un nombre d'observations inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 25 ou 30 est discutable. M. Wolf et ses deux coll\u00e8gues disposaient de cinq observations PO-INT et de cinq observations PO-EXT, lesquelles provenaient des titres d'emploi g\u00e9n\u00e9riques . L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a toutefois trac\u00e9 \u00e0 la main des courbes de r\u00e9gression \u00e0 partir de ce nombre limit\u00e9 d'observations.\n[754] La deuxi\u00e8me lacune \u00e9tait que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait exclu l'une des cinq observations lorsqu'elle avait trac\u00e9 sa courbe de r\u00e9gression PO-EXT car elle avait estim\u00e9 que cette observation \u00e9tait anormale \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'emploi concern\u00e9 faisait l'objet d'une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration beaucoup plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse que les autres emplois. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il a pu y avoir une raison plus plausible pour son exclusion. Selon Postes Canada, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse, elle aurait pu d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'y avait aucune relation entre les salaires et les valeurs des emplois.\n[755] La troisi\u00e8me lacune \u00e9tait l'extrapolation par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration PO-INT et PO-EXT laquelle, selon Postes Canada, d\u00e9montrait que la majorit\u00e9 des pointages Hay obtenu pour les CR 2, 3, 4, et 5 tombait en dehors de la fourchette des pointages PO. Ce n'est que par l'extrapolation qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de faire cette comparaison \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas d'emplois PO de valeur \u00e9gale aux nombreux emplois CR, lesquels ont une valeur inf\u00e9rieure. Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada \u00e9tait d'opinion que, \u00e0 en juger par les donn\u00e9es recueillies par la Commission, il n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas possible de faire un rajustement de salaire pour ces emplois CR, lesquels sont de valeur inf\u00e9rieure.\n[756] La quatri\u00e8me lacune avait trait au fait que l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle avait choisi des mod\u00e8les de rajustement des salaires que Postes Canada avait estim\u00e9 injustifi\u00e9s. Ayant \u00e9labor\u00e9 sept courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration niveau\/courbe et une solution bas\u00e9e sur l'appariement de postes par points pour seulement trois des ann\u00e9es concern\u00e9es, Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que M. Wolf, sans \u00e9laborer, et ses deux coll\u00e8gues avaient recommand\u00e9 la solution la plus dispendieuse pour chacune des trois ann\u00e9es. L'Alliance et la Commission pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient la solution moins dispendieuse de la moyenne composite PO-INT et PO-EXT.\n[757] Quant \u00e0 l'analyse de M. Ranger, Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le travail de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, les lacunes figurant dans le raisonnement et dans l'analyse de celle-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduites dans le travail de M. Ranger. De plus, Postes Canada a mis en doute la m\u00e9thode de M. Ranger quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les emplois PO pour les ann\u00e9es non couvertes par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, notamment en raison du fait que celui-ci a fond\u00e9 ses courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sur seulement deux points d'observation.\n[758] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que, en raison des lacunes fondamentales que comportait l'analyse de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, lesquelles lacunes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9es par la m\u00e9thode douteuse de M. Ranger, l'analyse et les calculs de M. Ranger doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s du revers de la main.\n[759] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires de M. Kervin comportait \u00e9galement de graves lacunes et elle a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suit les quatre \u00e9tapes fondamentales de cette m\u00e9thode :\n\u00c9TAPE\nUne courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin a \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9e \u00e0 l'aide d'une analyse de r\u00e9gression des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine PO-INT et PO-EXT. Une valeur moyenne des pointages d'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie pour les emplois compris dans chacun des quatre niveaux CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Les \u00e9tapes 1 et 2 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es pour obtenir une pr\u00e9diction de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les personnes de sexe masculin pour chaque niveau CR. La diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire horaire moyen pour chaque niveau CR et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9vue pour les personnes de sexe masculin pour le niveau CR en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et elle repr\u00e9sentait le montant de rajustement de salaire \u00e0 \u00eatre apport\u00e9 au niveau CR.\n[760] Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tape 1 comportait six lacunes, lesquelles allaient du fait que la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin comprenait l'un des dix emplois PO qui n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et qui \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de 33 \u00e0 55 p. 100 de personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin (le PO-4), au fait que M. Kervin avait trac\u00e9 ses courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avait calcul\u00e9 les rajustements de salaire pour l'ensemble des ann\u00e9es en dollars de 1995 uniquement.\n[761] \u00c0 l'\u00e9tape 2, Postes Canada a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'en pr\u00e9sumant que tous les postes au sein d'un m\u00eame niveau CR, que ce soit CR 2, 3, 4 ou 5, avaient la m\u00eame valeur de l'emploi (la valeur de l'emploi moyenne au sein de ce niveau), un certain nombre d'anomalies difficiles, voire m\u00eame absurdes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le chevauchement important des valeurs des emplois entre les niveaux CR. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'un recensement plut\u00f4t qu'un \u00e9chantillonnage pourrait, en effet, \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape des rajustements afin de garantir un rajustement \u00e9quitable des salaires.\n[762] Postes Canada a critiqu\u00e9 l'\u00e9tape 3 de la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin au motif qu'elle traitait l'ensemble des titulaires d'emploi PO comme s'ils \u00e9taient des personnes de sexe masculin et l'ensembles des emplois PO comme s'ils \u00e9taient des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, m\u00eame si dans les observations de Postes Canada aucune de ces hypoth\u00e8ses n'\u00e9taient vraies.\n[763] Enfin, Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tape 4 aurait pour cons\u00e9quence que l'ensemble des postes compris dans un niveau CR donn\u00e9 recevraient le m\u00eame rajustement de salaire sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur v\u00e9ritable valeur de l'emploi ou \u00e0 leur v\u00e9ritable pourcentage en personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin. Par exemple, si un emploi particulier au niveau CR 2 n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, cet emploi obtiendrait le m\u00eame rajustement de salaire qu'un emploi CR 2 qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que seulement 69,1 p. 100 des titulaires de poste CR-2 \u00e9taient des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils \u00e9taient un peu et non pas surtout compos\u00e9s de personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin (l'ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e). Toutefois, parmi tous les niveaux CR, c'est aux emplois CR-2 que la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin accorderait le rajustement de salaire le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[764] Postes Canada a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que, en vertu du mod\u00e8le de M. Kervin, trois des quatre niveaux CR recevraient un rajustement de salaire qui d\u00e9passerait largement ce que M. Killingsworth avait calcul\u00e9 dans son Mod\u00e8le 1 comme \u00e9tant la diff\u00e9rence de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration maximum qui peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e au sexe. Selon Postes Canada, cela est anormale car M. Kervin, lorsqu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage, a approuv\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 totalement le Mod\u00e8le 1 de M. Killingsworth .\n[765] En conclusion, Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 qu'un montant allou\u00e9 pour \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9 sur la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin comporterait de graves lacunes et devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\n[766] Postes Canada a propos\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode alternative de rajustement des salaires qui, selon elle, ne comporterait pas les lacunes figurant dans les propositions de M. Ranger et de M. Kervin et elle permettrait d'atteindre l'objectif vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 de la Loi. Les principes fondamentaux de la proposition de rajustement des salaires de Postes Canada sont les suivants :\nPRINCIPE\nComme l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 est l'\u00e9limination des \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9es sur le sexe, les salaires ne seraient augment\u00e9s que pour les emplois au sein d'un niveau CR qui sont \u00e0 forte pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Comme l'article 11 n'exige des rajustements de salaire que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il y a r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration in\u00e9gale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, des rajustements devraient \u00eatre apport\u00e9s au niveau de l'emploi o\u00f9 la valeur de l'emploi est raisonnablement pr\u00e9cise. Les rajustements de salaire ne devraient corriger que les diff\u00e9rences de salaire attribuables \u00e0 la composition de l'emploi en personnes de tel ou tel sexe et ne devraient qu'\u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et les emplois occup\u00e9s par des personnes de sexe masculin. Des rajustements de salaire ne devraient \u00eatre apport\u00e9s qu'en tant qu' arr\u00e9rages visant \u00e0 compenser pour la discrimination pass\u00e9e. L'Alliance et Postes Canada ont convenu dans leur convention collective actuelle que les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration respectent l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[767] Dans le but d'appliquer ces principes, Postes Canada a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9taill\u00e9e que nous ne d\u00e9crirons pas ici. Qu'il suffise de dire que cette proc\u00e9dure comportait l'utilisation des Mod\u00e8les 1 et 7 de M. Killingsworth pour chacune des ann\u00e9es comprises entre 1981 et 2001 et l'utilisation des taux r\u00e9els de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO et des CR, lesquels comprenaient les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices marginaux et l'indemnit\u00e9 de repas pay\u00e9 de 6,7 p. 100 pour les ann\u00e9es au cours desquelles elle \u00e9tait en vigueur. Elle pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement la d\u00e9termination du pourcentage en personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin dans chacun des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine202.\n[768] Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que si le Tribunal ordonnait en l'esp\u00e8ce un rajustement de salaire, elle devrait ordonner aux parties d'utiliser cette m\u00e9thode pour le calcul des montants pertinents, tout en reconnaissant que l'accord de l'ensemble des parties serait exig\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la meilleure fa\u00e7on d'appliquer cette m\u00e9thode.\n[769] Deux autres questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par Postes Canada. La premi\u00e8re avait trait \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 de repas pay\u00e9 , lequel b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, selon Postes Canada \u00e9tait compris ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans les calculs de M. Wolf, de M. Kervin et de M. Ranger. Cette majoration de 6,7 p. 100 du taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO devrait, selon Postes Canada, \u00eatre retir\u00e9e. Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que les t\u00e9moignages de Messieurs Edward Fournier et Harold Dunstan, deux de ses t\u00e9moins, avaient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice marginal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu par la n\u00e9gociation collective et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 en vue d'am\u00e9liorer la productivit\u00e9. Connu sous le nom de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au rendement , Postes Canada a fait valoir que ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e9tait manifestement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la productivit\u00e9 et non pas au sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon Postes Canada, parce que le paragraphe 16(a) de l'ordonnance de 1986 mentionne qu'une diff\u00e9rence de salaires entre les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui ex\u00e9cutent un travail de valeur \u00e9gale est justifi\u00e9e par des \u00e9valuations du rendement diff\u00e9rentes, cette diff\u00e9rence particuli\u00e8re ne peut pas faire partie d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[770] La deuxi\u00e8me question avait trait \u00e0 l'incidence sur Postes Canada de la n\u00e9gociation collective et de la situation qui a pr\u00e9valu en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de la proclamation, en octobre 1981, de la Loi sur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Lorsque Postes Canada est devenue une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat, les unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation qui existaient alors ainsi que les repr\u00e9sentants de l'ancien minist\u00e8re des postes, sont demeur\u00e9es les m\u00eames jusqu'en 1985, et ce, afin de permettre une transition stable. Cela, ainsi que l'introduction en 1982 de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du 6 et 5 p. 100 sur le contr\u00f4le des co\u00fbts, ont emp\u00each\u00e9 Postes Canada de commencer \u00e0 r\u00e9former tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t le processus de n\u00e9gociation collective.\n[771] Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9, que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, [Traduction] on ne peut pas, en toute bonne foi, affirmer qu'elle avait \u00e9tabli ou maintenu des disparit\u00e9s salariales avant 1985 au plus t\u00f4t203 .\n[772] Postes Canada est all\u00e9e plus loin dans cet argument en renvoyant au fait que le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles n'a rendu qu'en 1988 sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la structure appropri\u00e9e des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation \u00e0 Postes Canada et son effet ne s'est pas fait sentir avant la ronde de n\u00e9gociation suivante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue de 1989 \u00e0 1992. Postes Canada a, par cons\u00e9quent, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nEncore une fois, on ne peut pas raisonnablement affirmer que Postes Canada a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 11 car elle n'avait pas vraiment le pouvoir de participer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement ou au maintien des salaires avant cette p\u00e9riode de temps204.\n(iv) Les observations de l'Alliance en r\u00e9plique [773] En r\u00e9pondant aux critiques de Postes Canada concernant l'insertion manuelle de la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des hommes, l'Alliance a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que bien que [Traduction] les r\u00e9sultats soient peut-\u00eatre un peu moins pr\u00e9cis que ceux de l'analyse de r\u00e9gression, la technique utilis\u00e9e par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e avec succ\u00e8s par M. Willis dans son \u00e9tude de l'\u00c9tat de Washington. L'Alliance a \u00e9galement compris que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s proches de ceux de M. Kervin.\n[774] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que les interrogations de Postes Canada quant au travail effectu\u00e9 par M. Ranger lorsqu'il a trac\u00e9 des courbes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration PO pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la plainte n'avaient [Traduction] aucun fondement . Les calculs de M. Ranger ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 partir de principes math\u00e9matiques fondamentaux et reproduisaient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la m\u00e9thode de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle.\n[775] L'Alliance a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que lorsque les analyses de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et de M. Ranger ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, il n'\u00e9tait possible que de comparer les postes CR aux emplois PO. Le travail de M. Wilson et de M. Killingsworth a permis \u00e0 M. Kervin de regrouper les postes CR en emplois CR, ce qui lui a permis de faire son analyse sur ce fondement. Malgr\u00e9 cette diff\u00e9rence, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par M. Kervin \u00e9taient [Traduction] tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 ceux obtenus par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et M. Ranger, et, subsidiairement, l'Alliance a adopt\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin.\n[776] L'Alliance a fait mention du fait qu'une augmentation de salaire de pr\u00e8s de 20 p. 100 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par Postes Canada aux employ\u00e9s CR en 1995\/1996 et que cette augmentation r\u00e9duirait l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1995.\n[777] Quant \u00e0 l'autre m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires envisag\u00e9e par Postes Canada, l'Alliance a soulign\u00e9 que cette m\u00e9thode n'a jamais express\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e durant l'audience et que ses co\u00fbts demeurent inconnus. L'Alliance a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle avait souscrit aux pr\u00e9tentions de la Commission quant aux probl\u00e8mes intrins\u00e8ques reli\u00e9s \u00e0 une telle m\u00e9thode.\n[778] L'Alliance a \u00e9mis des doutes quant \u00e0 l'utilisation par Postes Canada de l'alin\u00e9a 16a) de l'ordonnance de 1986 pour justifier l'exclusion de la valeur du repas pay\u00e9 du calcul des salaires des PO en renvoyant \u00e0 l'article 17 de l'ordonnance de 1986. L'article 17 exige que le facteur raisonnable invoqu\u00e9 soit appliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on uniforme \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin concern\u00e9s. Selon l'Alliance, Postes Canada n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver que le groupe de comparaison \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et le groupe des plaignants \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient tous les deux de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au rendement parce que la preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi indique qu'il n'existe pas de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au rendement pour les CR.\n[779] La r\u00e9ponse de l'Alliance aux d\u00e9fenses invoqu\u00e9es par Postes Canada comme quoi elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenue responsable, en vertu de l'article 11, d'avoir pratiqu\u00e9 la discrimination salariale pendant un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es, dans les ann\u00e9es 1980, a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : [Traduction] Ces d\u00e9fenses sont sans fondement . Bien que Postes Canada ait toujours pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'y avait pas de discrimination salariale, l'Alliance a affirm\u00e9 que Postes Canada avait d'abord maintenu, puis avait \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante l'existence de discrimination salariale entre les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin ex\u00e9cutant un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, une infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 11. L'Alliance a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada aurait pu corriger la situation en effectuant des rajustements volontaires en cas de disparit\u00e9 salariale, en dehors des conventions collectives, et ce, sans affecter les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations de base, comme le gouvernement du Canada l'a fait lors de l'\u00e9tude du Comit\u00e9 mixte. Postes Canada a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[780] L'Alliance a donc affirm\u00e9 que la p\u00e9riode de temps pr\u00e9cise pendant laquelle Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle n'avait pas le pouvoir d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale ne devrait pas \u00eatre exclue du champ d'application de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n(v) Les observations de la Commission en r\u00e9plique [781] La Commission a reconnu qu'elle avait formul\u00e9 sa position sur la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires apr\u00e8s qu'une bonne partie de la preuve eut \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage de M. Wilson concernant le regroupement des postes CR en emplois CR, et apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de M. Kervin, que la Commission s'est sentie \u00e0 l'aise de prendre une position ferme quant au choix de la m\u00e9thode de niveau\/courbe.\n[782] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada avait mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires qu'elle et l'Alliance avaient utilis\u00e9e en pr\u00e9tendant que les deux m\u00e9thodes traitaient la moyenne de chaque niveau CR comme un emploi . La Commission a r\u00e9pondu en d\u00e9clarant que sa m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires ne traite pas chaque niveau comme un emploi mais fait la moyenne des valeurs des emplois par niveau CR parce que l'ensemble des CR dans un niveau donn\u00e9 sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on aux fins de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[783] Les calculs de Postes Canada, fond\u00e9s sur la m\u00e9thode de M. Ranger, quant \u00e0 une possible indemnit\u00e9 totale d'environ 2,4 milliards de dollars et ses calculs, fond\u00e9s sur le mod\u00e8le de M. Kervin, quant \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 d'environ 443 millions de dollars, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en doute par la Commission. Selon, la Commission, aucune preuve \u00e0 l'appui d\u00e9montrant comment ces chiffres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus, ni aucune preuve permettant de reproduire ces calculs, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie.\n[784] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce que la Commission a estim\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant des calculs exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment gonfl\u00e9s par Postes Canada, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait effectu\u00e9 ses propres calculs en se fondant sur la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin. La Commission a fait remarquer que ses calculs n'\u00e9taient que des estimations car les montants pr\u00e9cis d\u00e9pendraient d'un certain nombre de facteurs au sujet desquels on ne poss\u00e8de pas de renseignements \u00e0 l'heure actuelle. Voici des exemples de ces facteurs : le nombre pr\u00e9cis d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Postes Canada pendant chacune des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, leur nombre d'ann\u00e9es de service ainsi que les montants auxquels chacun a droit en vertu de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards .\n[785] En se fondant sur le nombre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de personnes dans la population CR et en supposant une ann\u00e9e de 1956,6 heures, la Commission a estim\u00e9 que les co\u00fbts possibles de la rectification de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration chez les CR seraient de l'ordre suivant :\n(1) Si on utilise le taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat figurant dans la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires :\ncompos\u00e9 semestriellement environ 527,5 M$\nint\u00e9r\u00eat simple annuel environ 357,4 M$\n(2) Si on utilise le taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat des obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada :\ncompos\u00e9 semestriellement environ 375,2 M$\nint\u00e9r\u00eat simple annuel environ 301,1 M$\n[786] La Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait fait ce qu'elle avait estim\u00e9 \u00eatre un certain nombre d'hypoth\u00e8ses et de choix raisonnables pour en arriver \u00e0 ces estimations, et ce, afin de donner au Tribunal une vue plus r\u00e9aliste des co\u00fbts potentiels que ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9 jusqu'alors.\n[787] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de rejeter les attaques de Postes Canada contre la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires de M. Kervin est de traiter plusieurs questions importantes de la mani\u00e8re suivante.\n[788] La premi\u00e8re question \u00e9tait celle de l'interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e faite par Postes Canada de l'article 11 et de sa mauvaise compr\u00e9hension ou de son refus d'acceptation de l'article 13 de l'ordonnance de 1986. Selon la Commission, il semblerait que Postes Canada s'opposait tout simplement \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle l'article 13 de l'ordonnance de 1986 \u00e9tablit la pr\u00e9dominance de tel ou tel sexe et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait l'utilisation d'une autre m\u00e9thode ou l'utilisation d'un autre pourcentage limite. La Commission croyait que la jurisprudence \u00e9tayait sa m\u00e9thode d'application de l'article 13 de l'ordonnance de 1986.\n[789] La deuxi\u00e8me question \u00e9tait celle de l'utilisation de la courbe de r\u00e9gression lin\u00e9aire. La Commission croyait que Postes Canada avait \u00e0 plusieurs reprises mal compris l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'analyse de r\u00e9gression utilis\u00e9e dans les m\u00e9thodes de rajustement de salaire. Elle ne vise pas, comme l'a argument\u00e9 Postes Canada, \u00e0 expliquer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 faire une synth\u00e8se des salaires des groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine ainsi que des salaires des groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, de telle sorte que des comparaisons puissent \u00eatre faites en moyenne en rapport avec une nouvelle mesure de valeur des emplois obtenue \u00e0 l'aide d'un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois neutre.\n[790] La troisi\u00e8me question \u00e9tait celle de l'utilisation de l'extrapolation. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Kervin n'a pas remis en question l'utilisation de l'extrapolation. Il n'a pas non plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait trop peu d'emplois pour que l'on puisse calculer une courbe de r\u00e9gression quant aux emplois PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Ce que M. Kervin a affirm\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait qu'il serait plus difficile d'extrapoler si la courbe n'\u00e9tait pas lin\u00e9aire. Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO \u00e9tait lin\u00e9aire.\n[791] La quatri\u00e8me question \u00e9tait celle de la critique de Postes Canada de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires niveau\/courbe, laquelle, selon la Commission permettait d'obtenir l' \u00e9quit\u00e9 en moyenne au sein de la structure de classification existante des CR. La Commission a soulign\u00e9 que l'un des objets vis\u00e9s par la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe, comme pour tout mod\u00e8le de courbe de r\u00e9gression, consiste \u00e0 permettre des rajustements de salaire lorsqu'il n'est pas possible de faire des comparaisons directes emploi par emploi.\n[792] La cinqui\u00e8me question avait trait \u00e0 une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation de la valeur significative du Mod\u00e8le 1 de M. Killingsworth en ce qui a trait au calcul des rajustements au titre de la parit\u00e9 salariale . En affirmant que la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe peut produire des r\u00e9sultats absurdes , lorsqu'elle est compar\u00e9e au Mod\u00e8le 1 de M. Killingsworth, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada n'avait pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que le Mod\u00e8le 1 \u00e9tait fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent d'un mod\u00e8le niveau\/courbe et qu'il mesurait une variable diff\u00e9rente. La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que, bien que M. Kervin ait reconnu que le Mod\u00e8le 1 pouvait montrer l'existence d'un probl\u00e8me de parit\u00e9 salariale , elle a estim\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas convenable quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de rajustements pr\u00e9cis au titre de la parti\u00e9 salariale .\n[793] Quant \u00e0 l'autre m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires propos\u00e9e par Postes Canada, la Commission l'a qualifi\u00e9e de nouvelle m\u00e9thode , mais elle a pr\u00e9tendu que, lorsque Postes Canada l'avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, Postes Canada n'avait pas tenu compte de l'article 11 de la Loi, de l'ordonnance de 1986 ainsi que de la jurisprudence, ou les avait mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es. Il a sembl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu'il s'agissait d'une tentative d'\u00e9viter l'application de la Loi et que cette m\u00e9thode m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat qui ne favoriserait pas l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 parce qu'elle ne r\u00e8glerait pas la question de la discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle, ni la question de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes.\n[794] La Commission a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de Postes Canada que la m\u00e9thode qu'elle proposait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans le pass\u00e9 et que, notamment, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 largement accept\u00e9e . La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que la source cit\u00e9e par Postes Canada ne prouvait pas le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette proposition. Selon la Commission, la m\u00e9thode propos\u00e9e par Postes Canada n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, que ce soit au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou dans un autre ressort au Canada, et n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9e par aucune politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de parit\u00e9 salariale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale.\n[795] La Commission a de plus pr\u00e9tendu qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la proposition de Postes Canada repose sur l'utilisation du pourcentage en personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin plut\u00f4t que sur le concept de la pr\u00e9dominance du sexe , elle va \u00e0 l'encontre de ce que les t\u00e9moins experts, Mme Armstrong et M. Kervin, ont pr\u00e9conis\u00e9 - s'attaquer au probl\u00e8me de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle et de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par les femmes, et ce, en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[796] Enfin, la Commission a soulign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de tenter de reproduire la m\u00e9thode de rajustement propos\u00e9e par Postes Canada et qu'aucun t\u00e9moin expert ou autre type de t\u00e9moin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e pour en discuter.\n[797] En somme, la Commission a affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal devrait adopter une approche tr\u00e8s prudente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires propos\u00e9e par Postes Canada et qu'il devrait la rejeter.\nC. L'analyse du Tribunal (i) Pr\u00e9liminaire [798] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que, selon toute vraisemblance, l'utilisation par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle comp\u00e9tente du plan Hay, du processus ainsi que des renseignements sur l'emploi, lesquels sont raisonnablement fiables, aurait comme r\u00e9sultat que des valeurs d'\u00e9valuation des emplois raisonnablement fiables seraient attribu\u00e9es au travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par les employ\u00e9s CR et par les employ\u00e9s PO (paragraphe [703]). En d\u00e9terminant la valeur du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par ces employ\u00e9s, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a appliqu\u00e9 le dosage de qualifications, d'effort et de responsabilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires pour leur ex\u00e9cution, compte tenu des conditions de travail, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences du paragraphe 11(2) de la Loi.\n[799] En comparant les valeurs des \u00e9valuations des postes CR et des emplois PO obtenues, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a conclu qu'une partie importante des postes CR \u00e9taient d'une valeur \u00e9gale ou sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des emplois PO. La prochaine \u00e9tape consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il existait un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les emplois PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les postes CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine apr\u00e8s avoir compar\u00e9 les valeurs des \u00e9valuations et les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration horaires des CR et des PO. L'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a conclu qu'il existait un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les CR et les PO qui ex\u00e9cutaient un travail de valeur \u00e9gale.\n[800] L'\u00e9tablissement de l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dans ce contexte est une \u00e9tape cruciale \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que c'est l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui t\u00e9moigne de la pratique discriminatoire interdite par l'article 11 de la Loi. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision que l'objet essentiel vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 est l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique - pour \u00e9tablir la parit\u00e9 salariale entre les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui ex\u00e9cutent un travail de valeur \u00e9gale dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement. C'est donc, en d\u00e9montrant l'existence d'une diff\u00e9rence de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine que l'existence de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique est prouv\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 11, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, pourvu que l'employeur n'ait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la diff\u00e9rence est attribuable \u00e0 l'un des facteurs raisonnables pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 16 de l'ordonnance de 1986, et pourvu \u00e9galement que la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration satisfasse aux exigences de la Loi.\n[801] Le Tribunal accepte que la preuve de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, qu'il s'agisse du t\u00e9moignage de vive voix de M. Wolf ou qu'il s'agisse des rapports pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe au Tribunal, suffit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration lorsque, \u00e0 Postes Canada, le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par le groupe des CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine est compar\u00e9 au travail de valeur \u00e9gale ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par le groupe des PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. La juge L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 a \u00e9crit ce qui suit dans la d\u00e9cision SEPQA quant \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9 de comparer un travail de valeur \u00e9gale :\nLa premi\u00e8re difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9side dans la notion d'\u00e9galit\u00e9. L'interdiction dont est l'objet la discrimination salariale s'inscrit dans un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif plus large visant \u00e0 \u00e9liminer tout acte discriminatoire et \u00e0 promouvoir l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans l'emploi. C'est dans ce cadre \u00e9largi que l'article 11 s'attaque au probl\u00e8me de la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par des femmes. Puisque cet objectif va au-del\u00e0 de l'interdiction \u00e9vidente de payer un salaire inf\u00e9rieur pour des fonctions strictement identiques, la notion d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 contenue \u00e0 l'article 11 ne devrait pas recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation formaliste ou restrictive205.\n[802] De plus, le Tribunal accepte que Postes Canada n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, dans ses politiques en mati\u00e8re de gestion du personnel ou en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, on retrouvait un des facteurs raisonnables pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 16 de l'ordonnance de 1986, lequel facteur pourrait expliquer que la cause de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est autre que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[803] Ayant accept\u00e9, dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale , qu'il y a eu \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et qu'il existe une preuve, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'il y a eu discrimination syst\u00e9mique, la prochaine \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 choisir la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires la plus appropri\u00e9e quant au calcul d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaires et quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9limination de l'\u00e9cart. Compte tenu des nombreuses circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, dans quelle mesure les propositions de rajustement des salaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce sont-elles appropri\u00e9es et y en a-t-il une ou plusieurs que le Tribunal estime acceptable?\n[804] Si on veut choisir la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires la plus appropri\u00e9e, il est utile de se rappeler les propos suivants tenus par le juge Evans dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, quant au r\u00f4le de la Commission et du tribunal dans un tel choix :\nL'article 11 fournit uniquement un cadre l\u00e9gislatif large dans lequel les probl\u00e8mes de discrimination salariale entre les hommes et les femmes doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la situation particuli\u00e8re de l'emploi, de la d\u00e9position des t\u00e9moins experts et des objectifs sous-jacents de la Loi. \u00c0 mon avis, interpr\u00e9ter l'article comme prescrivant implicitement, de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise propos\u00e9e par l'avocate du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les caract\u00e9ristiques des m\u00e9thodes de comparaison permises, serait incompatible avec l'objectif sous-jacent de l'article 11 et avec le dossier l\u00e9gislatif. Il faut in\u00e9vitablement laisser la Commission et le tribunal se prononcer au cas par cas sur de nombreux points avec l'aide d'experts206. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[805] D'apr\u00e8s la preuve dont il disposait et d'apr\u00e8s les propos tenus par le juge Evans dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, le Tribunal a conclu que le crit\u00e8re qu'il convient le mieux d'appliquer quant au caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 des m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires envisag\u00e9es est le crit\u00e8re suivant :\nLes m\u00e9thodes sont-elles compatibles avec l'objet de la Loi, son ordonnance ainsi que ses dispositions r\u00e9paratrices? Quel t\u00e9moignage d'expert a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu et quelle jurisprudence \u00e0 l'appui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e quant \u00e0 chacune des m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires? Quelle exp\u00e9rience la Commission poss\u00e9dait-elle quant \u00e0 ces m\u00e9thodes ou quant \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes similaires? Les m\u00e9thodes sont-elles suffisamment compatibles avec la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle le travail et les salaires sont structur\u00e9s par l'employeur, de telle sorte que si une r\u00e9paration \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9e, elle pourrait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e sans trop de difficult\u00e9s?\n[806] Le Tribunal a relev\u00e9 trois m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires qui, selon lui, m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es. Ces m\u00e9thodes sont les suivantes :\nLa Proposition de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle\/Ranger dans la version composite du PO INT - PO EXT, appel\u00e9e la m\u00e9thode E : cette version \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9thode de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, reproduite ult\u00e9rieurement par M. Ranger, lequel a \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9 des calculs sur des p\u00e9riodes de 12 mois; appuy\u00e9e par l'Alliance, accept\u00e9e par la Commission, jug\u00e9e inacceptable par Postes Canada. La proposition de la Commission\/Kervin dans une version composite PO : dans cette version, on se servait des documents de base de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle et de la m\u00e9thode de M. Kervin dans laquelle celui-ci a regroup\u00e9 des postes CR en emplois CR, et ce, gr\u00e2ce aux travaux de M. Wilson et de M. Killingsworth. Calcul\u00e9e par M. Kervin pour 1995, toutes les autres ann\u00e9es extrapol\u00e9es par la Commission. Solution privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e par la Commission, acceptable pour l'Alliance, inacceptable pour Postes Canada. La proposition de rechange de Postes Canada : propos\u00e9e par Postes Canada afin d'\u00e9viter ce qu'elle jugeait \u00eatre des lacunes dans les deux autres propositions. Pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les conclusions finales de Postes Canada. Acceptable pour Postes Canada, inacceptable pour l'Alliance et pour la Commission.\n(ii) Examen des propositions de m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires [807] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que sa proposition favoriserait l'atteinte de l'objectif vis\u00e9 par l'article 11 de la Loi en n'accordant aucune indemnit\u00e9 lorsqu'il n'y a aucun \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou lorsque l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n'est pas fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Les salaires ne seraient augment\u00e9s que pour les emplois dans un niveau CR qui sont \u00e0 forte pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine. Des rajustements devraient \u00eatre apport\u00e9s au niveau de l'emploi lorsque la valeur de l'emploi est raisonnablement pr\u00e9cise.\n[808] Toutefois, la Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada, en \u00e9laborant sa proposition, n'a pas tenu compte de l'article 11 de la Loi, de l'ordonnance de 1986 ainsi que de la jurisprudence, ou les avait mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, en ne traitant pas, dans la sous-\u00e9valuation du travail des femmes, de la discrimination salariale syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle.\n[809] Malheureusement, aucun t\u00e9moignage d'expert ou aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Postes Canada pour d\u00e9fendre sa position. Il y a toutefois eu un t\u00e9moignage de la part du t\u00e9moin expert de l'Alliance, M. Kervin, qui a pr\u00e9tendu que le Mod\u00e8le 1 de M. Killingsworth, lequel constituait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la proposition de Postes Canada, ne permettait pas de d\u00e9terminer avec pr\u00e9cision les rajustements des salaires. En effet, parce que la m\u00e9thode de M. Killingsworth ne tenait pas compte des exigences de la Loi et de l'ordonnance quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9dominance de tel ou tel sexe, ses Mod\u00e8les, selon M. Kervin, ne seraient pas appropri\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de partit\u00e9 salariale dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[810] La Commission a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de Postes Canada que la m\u00e9thode qu'elle avait propos\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans le pass\u00e9 et qu'elle avait obtenu beaucoup d'appui. D'apr\u00e8s ce qu'en sait la Commission, elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, que ce soit au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou dans un autre ressort au Canada, ni favoris\u00e9e en vertu de la politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale.\n[811] Le Tribunal souligne que la proposition de Postes Canada ne comprenait aucune estimation des co\u00fbts de son incidence possible en tant que m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 que la Commission n'avait pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de reproduire la m\u00e9thode de cette solution de rechange.\n[812] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier cette m\u00e9thode par rapport aux deux autres propositions, outre le fait de tenter de mettre en contexte les nombreuses critiques pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la Commission et appuy\u00e9es par l'Alliance. Alors qu'un ou deux aspects de la proposition de Postes Canada ont d\u00e9clench\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'enqu\u00eate de la part du Tribunal, il a conclu qu'il serait tr\u00e8s injuste, non seulement pour Postes Canada, la partie qui a initi\u00e9 la proposition, mais \u00e9galement pour les deux autres parties, de tenter de prendre une d\u00e9cision quant au caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 d'une affaire fort complexe, en se fiant sur le peu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve factuels disponibles et sur l'absence presque totale de t\u00e9moignages d'expert.\n[813] Dans ces circonstances, le Tribunal est contraint d'exclure la proposition de Postes Canada de tout examen ult\u00e9rieur.\n[814] L'Alliance et la Commission ont fait valoir que les deux autres propositions, malgr\u00e9 les critiques de Postes Canada \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, \u00e9taient conformes \u00e0 l'objet de la Loi, lequel, en conformit\u00e9 avec la d\u00e9cision rendue par le juge Laforest en 1987 dans la cause Robichaud, a un caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur207.\n[815] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement l'importance d'aborder la question des mesures correctives syst\u00e9miques lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Les mesures correctives devraient corriger les effets pass\u00e9s, pr\u00e9sents et futurs de la discrimination. Comme le juge Dickson, alors juge en chef de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, l'a affirm\u00e9 en 1987 : les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets [...] [et] la Loi [canadienne sur les droits de la personne] [n'a pas pour objet de punir la faute,] mais bien de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination208 . Apr\u00e8s une longue discussion sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et sur les m\u00e9thodes n\u00e9cessaires pour la combattre, le Juge en chef a conclu qu' il est essentiel de s'attaquer aux anciens r\u00e9gimes discriminatoires et de les d\u00e9truire afin d'emp\u00eacher \u00e0 l'avenir la r\u00e9surgence de cette m\u00eame discrimination209 .\n[816] En 1996, le juge Hugessen a soulign\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9somption voulant que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique ait produit les m\u00eames effets par le pass\u00e9 que ceux produit actuellement s'affaiblit progressivement, \u00e0 mesure qu'on remonte dans le pass\u00e9210 .\n[817] Le Tribunal accepte l'argument de la Commission que bien que la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires puisse \u00eatre une affaire assez technique, son v\u00e9ritable objet est la concr\u00e9tisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi et elle ne devrait donc pas faire l'objet d'une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive ou trop technique. En compl\u00e9ment de l'objet d'\u00e9galit\u00e9, il y a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire non normatif de r\u00e9paration du Tribunal pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi. La port\u00e9e du pouvoir de r\u00e9paration du Tribunal est donc non seulement discr\u00e9tionnaire mais elle est \u00e9galement \u00e9tendue dans l'ensemble des circonstances concern\u00e9es.\n[818] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Durber, un des premiers t\u00e9moins experts de la Commission, qui a trait\u00e9 du concept de l' \u00e9quit\u00e9 en moyenne comme facteur d\u00e9terminant lorsque l'on traite du concept de parit\u00e9 salariale . Il a fait valoir le point pertinent que l'on ne fait pas des comparaisons directes entre chaque emploi individuellement lorsque l'on recherche l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale dans des organismes importants o\u00f9 un grand nombre d'employ\u00e9s sont concern\u00e9s, on fait plut\u00f4t des comparaisons entre des groupes d'employ\u00e9s, lesquelles comparaisons permettent de r\u00e9aliser l' \u00e9quit\u00e9 en moyenne .\n[819] Afin de mettre en contexte les propos tenus par M. Durber quant \u00e0 l' \u00e9quit\u00e9 en moyenne , il est utile de se reporter au t\u00e9moignage qu'il a donn\u00e9 en mai 1993. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage en chef, alors qu'il expliquait pourquoi il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de faire une comparaison directe entre les emplois, M. Durber a soulign\u00e9 que [Traduction] le calcul de la moyenne veut dire qu'il y a des emplois dont la valeur est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que la moyenne et des emplois dont la valeur est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e que la moyenne211 .\n[820] De plus, M. Durber a conclu qu'il y avait des raisons pour lesquelles il n'\u00e9tait pas pratique, ni souhaitable, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de faire des comparaisons directes individuelles entre les emplois :\n[Traduction]\nL'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en moyenne n'aboutira \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me qui est \u00e9quitable en moyenne que dans le cas o\u00f9 l'on con\u00e7oit une r\u00e9paration et que l'on ne peut probablement pas se permettre de concevoir une r\u00e9paration pour l'ensemble des personnes parce que l'on a affaire \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique dans le cadre duquel on tente de voir si des structures enti\u00e8res devraient \u00eatre ajust\u00e9es pour des motifs raisonnables212. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[821] En effet, le livret de la Commission intitul\u00e9e Mise en uvre de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, auquel il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait renvoi dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, a d\u00e9crit la m\u00e9thode de la courbe des salaires , laquelle pr\u00e9sente les valeurs des emplois et les salaires des employ\u00e9s dans les emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine sur une courbe du salaire moyen. Le Tribunal accepte que la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe est appropri\u00e9e pour un cas de parit\u00e9 salariale comme celui en l'esp\u00e8ce et souligne que les deux propositions faisant l'objet d'un examen \u00e9tayaient la m\u00e9thode de la courbe composite niveau\/courbe PO des salaires des personnes de sexe masculin.\n[822] Le Tribunal sait que la cause du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, \u00e0 laquelle la Commission a particip\u00e9 activement, comportait de nombreux t\u00e9moignages de la part de t\u00e9moins experts appel\u00e9s \u00e0 donner leurs opinions concernant la s\u00e9lection d'une m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires acceptable213. Le tribunal dans cette cause a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode de niveau\/segment apr\u00e8s avoir entendu au moins quatre t\u00e9moins poss\u00e9dant une grande expertise sur le sujet vis\u00e9.\n[823] Le Tribunal accepte que les deux propositions reconnaissent que le m\u00e9canisme de redressement des salaires devrait \u00eatre con\u00e7u de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir \u00eatre mis en uvre dans l'organisme au niveau duquel la disparit\u00e9 salariale existe. En l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est une question d'ajustement des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les diff\u00e9rents niveaux de classification CR parce que l'article 11 vise \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination au sein du syst\u00e8me existant de classification des emplois de Postes Canada. Cela permettra aux employ\u00e9s des groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et aux employ\u00e9s des groupes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine qui ex\u00e9cutent un travail de valeur \u00e9gale dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement de recevoir une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9gale.\n[824] Les deux propositions reposaient, naturellement, sur certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'\u00e9valuation fondamentaux produits par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle, les renseignements sur les emplois qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s par le Tribunal comme \u00e9tant d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure . De plus, il y a toujours eu la question de savoir dans quelle mesure l'\u00e9chantillon CR \u00e9tait vraiment repr\u00e9sentatif, compte tenu des diff\u00e9rentes opinions \u00e9mises par M. Kervin et M. Bellhouse. M. Kervin a estim\u00e9 que l'\u00e9chantillon \u00e9tait suffisamment repr\u00e9sentatif pour fournir une repr\u00e9sentation ad\u00e9quate \u00e0 chaque niveau CR pour qu'il soit utilis\u00e9 dans sa m\u00e9thode.\n[825] Quant \u00e0 la question du repas pay\u00e9 , la preuve dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi \u00e9tait que les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO utilis\u00e9s dans les calculs de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle ainsi que dans les calculs de M. Kervin et de M. Ranger, refl\u00e9taient la valeur additionnelle de 6,7 p. 100214. Un ajout semblable aux taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des CR n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 car le repas pay\u00e9 ne s'applique pas aux employ\u00e9s CR. De plus, le Tribunal estime qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tayer l'argument de Postes Canada que la valeur du repas pay\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre exclue de l'application du paragraphe 16(a) de l'ordonnance de 1986 comme disposition de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au rendement , laquelle exigerait une application uniforme aux employ\u00e9s PO et CR en vertu de l'article 17 de l'ordonnance de 1986.\n[826] Il semble toutefois y avoir une certaine disparit\u00e9 entre ce que Postes Canada a demand\u00e9 dans sa proposition de rechange et ce qu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 concernant la proposition \u00c9quipe professionnelle\/Ranger et la proposition Kervin\/Commission pour ce qui est de la question du repas pay\u00e9 . Selon la preuve, une allocation de repas pay\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans la proposition de Postes Canada pour les employ\u00e9s PO quant aux ann\u00e9es pour lesquelles elle \u00e9tait en vigueur, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question par Postes Canada lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans les deux autres propositions215.\n[827] M. Ranger, M. Kervin et la Commission ont tous signal\u00e9 que leurs calculs respectifs n'avaient produit que des estimations. Du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire devra \u00eatre fait afin d'obtenir le co\u00fbt final des rajustements individuels par employ\u00e9 CR apr\u00e8s que l'on aura eu acc\u00e8s aux dossiers des employ\u00e9s avec l'accord de Postes Canada.\n[828] M. Ranger a notamment mentionn\u00e9 ses meilleures estimations des donn\u00e9es sur la population des employ\u00e9s, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillies \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 et pour lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient tous des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein. Il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait utilis\u00e9 les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration maximum d'un bout \u00e0 l'autre de ses calculs.\n(iii) R\u00e9sum\u00e9 [829] La d\u00e9termination de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires la plus appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'application du principe de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi et aux articles 13 et 14 de l'ordonnance de 1986 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une t\u00e2che facile. Dans l'analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les choix de m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties au moyen des quatre crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe [805] - c'est-\u00e0-dire, compatibilit\u00e9 avec l'objet et les dispositions r\u00e9paratrices de la Loi et de son ordonnance; renvoi \u00e0 des opinions d'expert et \u00e0 la jurisprudence \u00e0 l'appui; renvoi \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience de la Commission; compatibilit\u00e9 avec la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle le travail et les salaires sont structur\u00e9s par l'employeur.\n[830] Le Tribunal a retenu trois choix de m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires qu'il a accept\u00e9s d'examiner. Il a examin\u00e9 les trois m\u00e9thodes en fonction des quatre crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\n[831] Compte tenu de la complexit\u00e9 du sujet, le Tribunal a conclu que l'aide d'experts familiers avec la parit\u00e9 salariale et la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement importantes quant \u00e0 son examen de chacun des choix, non seulement sur le plan de la compr\u00e9hension de la nature de chacune des m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires, mais \u00e9galement sur le plan de la mise en contexte de chacune des m\u00e9thodes tout en interpr\u00e9tant l'objet et les principes de la Loi et de son ordonnance.\n[832] Malgr\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'avait le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00e9tudier davantage l'autre proposition de Postes Canada, on a conclu qu'elle reposait sur tr\u00e8s peu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve factuels et qu'elle n'avait fait l'objet d'aucun t\u00e9moignage d'expert. Dans ces circonstances, le Tribunal a conclu que ce choix n'\u00e9tait pas viable en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[833] Le Tribunal a conclu que chacun des deux choix restants - la proposition de l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle\/Ranger et la proposition Kervin\/Commission satisfont, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, aux quatre crit\u00e8res et peuvent donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des m\u00e9thodes de rajustement des salaires appropri\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[834] Le Tribunal, n'accepte toutefois pas comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9finitives les valeurs mon\u00e9taires fournies par les parties et par les t\u00e9moins quant \u00e0 chacune des deux propositions. La Commission et l'Alliance, ainsi que les experts et les autres t\u00e9moins sollicit\u00e9s, ont fait remarquer que leurs calculs respectifs ne sont que des estimations qui n\u00e9cessitent du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire si on veut obtenir le co\u00fbt final des rajustements des salaires de chaque employ\u00e9 CR.\n[835] L'acc\u00e8s aux dossiers de chaque employ\u00e9 avec l'accord de Postes Canada sera n\u00e9cessaire. De plus, un certain nombre de variables peuvent n\u00e9cessiter un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Cet examen peut comprendre les populations d'employ\u00e9s r\u00e9elles avec les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein et les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel, les divers taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration utilis\u00e9s et leurs sources et les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards .\n[836] Comme les deux propositions satisfont aux quatre crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9, et, si on ne tient pas compte des co\u00fbts de chacune, chacune des deux propositions peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires appropri\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, sous r\u00e9serve du travail additionnel auquel on a fait allusion au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n[837] Laquelle des deux propositions est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable? La Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal accepte la proposition Kervin\/Commission car ce sont les emplois qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s comme fondement de ses conclusions. La proposition comprenait \u00e9galement des renseignements plus \u00e0 jour.\n[838] M. Kervin a trait\u00e9 longuement qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, dans les causes de parit\u00e9 salariale , que la notion de discrimination syst\u00e9mique soit le fondement des d\u00e9cisions qui sont prises. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que, dans le contexte de la parit\u00e9 salariale , une all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique appelait un examen minutieux des emplois au sein de l'organisme concern\u00e9.\n[839] Ces propos refl\u00e8tent beaucoup ceux de Mme Pat Armstrong, laquelle a initi\u00e9 le Tribunal au concept de parit\u00e9 salariale . Elle, \u00e9galement, a soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de se concentrer sur les emplois plut\u00f4t que sur les personnes, de consid\u00e9rer le concept de la parit\u00e9 salariale comme \u00e9tant une \u00e9volution naturelle de l'histoire de la philosophie du monde des affaires.\n[840] Comme M. Kervin l'a fait remarquer :\n[Traduction]\nLa parit\u00e9 salariale a pour objet la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Elle a pour objet les d\u00e9cisions discriminatoires qui ne sont pas prises sur une base individuelle, mais qui font plut\u00f4t partie intrins\u00e8que de l'approche d'un organisme quant aux emplois et quant \u00e0 leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Cela explique en partie pourquoi elle va au-del\u00e0 du concept de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9gale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, lequel concept fait appel \u00e0 la discrimination non syst\u00e9mique; en d'autres mots, la discrimination visait une personne pr\u00e9cise : Je n'aime pas votre t\u00eate, alors je vais voir \u00e0 ce que vous ne receviez pas la m\u00eame r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration .\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, on parle de d\u00e9cisions qui sont prises quant \u00e0 des emplois, quant \u00e0 leur nature, et, la chose importante - et l'une des raisons pour lesquelles je crois que l'accent est mis sur les emplois plut\u00f4t que sur les postes, est que l'on d\u00e9sire que ces d\u00e9cisions concernent la nature du travail.\nSi la parit\u00e9 salariale traite des d\u00e9cisions concernant la nature du travail et de la valeur de cette nature pour les organismes, alors on peut voir que la d\u00e9cision a lieu lorsque l'on pense \u00e0 l'emploi.\nS'il n'y a pas d'emplois, alors elle aura lieu au niveau du poste. Mais l\u00e0, il faut s'assurer que les caract\u00e9ristiques du titulaire - taille, couleur des yeux, race, calvitie, etc. - ne sont pas prises en compte dans le processus de d\u00e9cision. Il s'agit de comportements discriminatoires d'un genre diff\u00e9rent.\nEn mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale, il est question d'emplois de valeur \u00e9gale. L'emploi lui-m\u00eame, compte tenu de ce qu'il vaut pour l'organisme devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement en fonction de cette valeur pour l'organisme216.\n[841] Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Kervin a pig\u00e9 dans le travail de M. Wilson et de M. Killingsworth et le regroupement que ceux-ci ont fait des postes CR pour cr\u00e9er des emplois avec les caract\u00e9ristiques des postes \u00e9valu\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle. Ils ont converti les 194 postes CR en un certain nombre d'emplois en regroupant les renseignements sur l'ensemble des postes en un certain nombre d'emplois . M. Kervin a d\u00e9crit ce travail comme [Traduction] un regroupement des \u00e9valuations des postes en \u00e9valuations des emplois . (Pi\u00e8ce HR-93A)\n[842] Avec ces emplois, selon M. Kervin, on peut \u00e9tablir une comparaison entre les emplois PO et les emplois CR, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une technique niveau\/courbe, et on peut d\u00e9terminer comment \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 partir de cette comparaison.\n[843] La courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin est cr\u00e9\u00e9e, selon M. Kervin, en observant les donn\u00e9es sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ainsi que les points Hay pour les emplois PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Ensuite, la moyenne ou la valeur moyenne pour chaque niveau CR peut \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e en utilisant les renseignements quant aux emplois CR. Il faut maintenant se demander quelle serait la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au niveau CR si les emplois dans cette cat\u00e9gorie \u00e9taient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s en fonction de la courbe de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe masculin ? Cette nouvelle r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnes de sexe f\u00e9minin est la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart.\n[844] Cet accent sur les emplois est important pour le concept de parit\u00e9 salariale . En s'appuyant sur la capacit\u00e9 d'aborder sous un angle positif le concept de l'\u00e9limination de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, par l'utilisation des renseignements sur les emplois respectifs concern\u00e9s, le Tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la proposition Kervin\/Commission.\n[845] L'exclusion de paiements exig\u00e9s par la Loi ( r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards ) des calculs dans les deux propositions est le sujet de la prochaine partie de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, laquelle est intitul\u00e9e Les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte .\nVIII. LES FORMES DE R\u00c9MUN\u00c9RATION INDIRECTE A. Contexte [846] Les dispositions de la Loi qui sont pertinentes \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente section de la d\u00e9cision se trouvent aux paragraphes 11(1) et 11(7) de la Loi et elles ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es plus haut. Par souci de commodit\u00e9, ces dispositions sont reproduites ci-dessous :\nDisparit\u00e9 salariale discriminatoire\n11(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\nD\u00e9finition de salaire\n11(7)Pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent article salaire s'entend de toute forme de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration payable \u00e0 un individu en contrepartie de son travail et, notamment\na) des traitements, commissions, indemnit\u00e9s de vacances ou de licenciement et des primes;\nb) de la juste valeur des prestations en repas, loyers, logement et h\u00e9bergement;\nc) des r\u00e9tributions en nature;\nd) des cotisations de l'employeur aux caisses ou r\u00e9gimes de pension, aux r\u00e9gimes d'assurance contre l'invalidit\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e et aux r\u00e9gimes d'assurance-maladie de toute nature;\ne) des autres avantages re\u00e7us directement ou indirectement de l'employeur. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[847] Par souci de clart\u00e9, le Tribunal souligne que deux expressions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on interchangeable dans la preuve et dans le t\u00e9moignage pour traiter du sujet qui nous occupe. La premi\u00e8re expression est formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, le titre de la pr\u00e9sente section de la d\u00e9cision. L'autre expression est r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards.\n[848] Les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, parfois appel\u00e9s dans la preuve avantages sp\u00e9ciaux , r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte , salaires indirects ou m\u00eame salaires non p\u00e9cuniaires ou r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration non p\u00e9cuniaire est l'expression qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e le plus souvent pour d\u00e9crire l'ensemble des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au paragraphe 11 (7) de la Loi, autres que le salaire de base.\n[849] L'expression r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards semble avoir surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans le contexte de la r\u00e9paration. Par exemple, interrog\u00e9 par l'avocat de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 savoir si Postes Canada devrait faire des remises exig\u00e9es par la loi en rapport avec des rajustements de salaire occasionn\u00e9s par un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et ce, quant \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme l'assurance-emploi, la taxe en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, les pensions, M. Ranger a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\nR. Je crois certainement que les rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale quant aux nouveaux taux sont des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards.\nQ. Donc cela comprendrait, selon vous, de faire des remises exig\u00e9es par la loi en vertu de toute loi pertinente?\nR. Oui217.\n[850] Un autre exemple est l'utilisation qui est faite de l'expression suivante par la Commission \u00e0 la page 187 (Chapitre 13) de ses observations :\n[Traduction]\nPar cons\u00e9quent, une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards tiendra compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que tout rajustement de taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration aura une incidence sur tout avantage qui est li\u00e9 au salaire de base.\n[851] En fait, le Tribunal examine la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte \u00e0 deux niveaux. Le premier niveau est l'incidence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne font pas partie du salaire de base et qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe 11(7), lequel porte sur la d\u00e9finition de salaire . Le deuxi\u00e8me niveau est l'inclusion dans tout rajustement d'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, non seulement des rajustements au salaire de base ou salaire direct, mais \u00e9galement des rajustements aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne font pas partie de ce salaire de base, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[852] Vraisemblablement, cela ne constitue un probl\u00e8me que si les co\u00fbts des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne font pas partie du salaire de base n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ceux-ci n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans la d\u00e9finition de salaire de l'employeur. Si leurs co\u00fbts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis et inclus dans le salaire , leur valeur se refl\u00e9tera dans les rajustements de salaire r\u00e9sultants. L'employeur devra \u00e9videmment d\u00e9duire du rajustement du salaire brut des employ\u00e9s des \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pertinent et les contributions cumul\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime de pension cumul\u00e9es. L'employeur aura toutefois une charge additionnelle compte tenu qu'il devra faire des remises sur tout rajustement de salaire, lesquelles pourraient \u00eatre exig\u00e9es en vertu des obligations non salariales fond\u00e9es sur la loi auxquelles contribuent conjointement l'employ\u00e9 et l'employeur, comme les contributions au r\u00e9gime de pension.\n[853] Il est important de souligner qu'en concluant qu'il existait un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration tel que d\u00e9crit \u00e0 la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle a fond\u00e9 son analyse sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe de base des postes CR et des emplois PO, laquelle ne comprenait pas les avantages sp\u00e9ciaux. La Commission, lorsqu'elle a fait ses \u00e9valuations des emplois lors de l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, n'a pas express\u00e9ment \u00e9tabli les co\u00fbts des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations indirectes.\n[854] Les parties ont toutefois toutes reconnu que les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations indirectes, au sens du paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi, doivent \u00eatre prises en compte dans le cadre d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale . En effet, en 1995, l'Alliance a embauch\u00e9 un expert, M. Don Lee, pour traiter de la question des co\u00fbts de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 12 ans situ\u00e9e entre 1983 et 1995. Son rapport fait l'objet d'un examen plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente section de la d\u00e9cision.\nB. Les observations des parties (i) La position de la Commission [855] La phrase suivante figurait au paragraphe 58 du rapport d'enqu\u00eate final de la Commission, dat\u00e9 du 24 janvier 1992 :\n[Traduction]\nEn d\u00e9finitive, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, il semble y avoir un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration non p\u00e9cuniaire.\n[856] M. Paul Durber, lorsqu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve principale en juin 1993, s'est fait demander par l'avocat de la Commission de donner des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration figurant dans le rapport d'enqu\u00eate final. Il a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nOn se souviendra que, d'apr\u00e8s certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ant\u00e9rieurs, l'article 11 exige, \u00e9videmment, que l'on examine non seulement les salaires mais \u00e9galement l'ensemble des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. C'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on doit examiner ce que l'on a appel\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce les salaires non p\u00e9cuniaires, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte218.\n[857] Lorsque l'avocat de la Commission lui a demand\u00e9 quel serait l'effet de cette r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte sur le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9cart de r\u00e9num\u00e9ration, M. Durber a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nEn d\u00e9finitive, il semble qu'elle amplifie quelque peu l'\u00e9cart. Il est difficile d'\u00e9valuer dans quelle mesure. Nous savons que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration non p\u00e9cuniaire compte pour la partie la moins importante de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale - c'est-\u00e0-dire peut-\u00eatre 30 p. 100 - et nous savons que la plus grande partie de ce 30 p. 100 d\u00e9pend du salaire de base [...]\nDonc, nous ne disposons pas de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Nous savons que la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate est incompl\u00e8te sur ce point. Nous n'avons pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capables d'obtenir les renseignements et nous avons tir\u00e9 une conclusion tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'il existe peut-\u00eatre un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration additionnel. Nous ne croyons pas que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte ou r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration non p\u00e9cuniaire r\u00e9duira l'\u00e9cart [...]219\n[858] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites finales, le seul renvoi que la Commission semble avoir fait \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte est un renvoi indirect, dans le contexte de la m\u00e9thode de rajustement des salaires, lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\n[...] il est essentiel que les rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale comprennent non seulement des rajustements au salaire de base, mais \u00e9galement des rajustements \u00e0 tous \u00e9gard, c'est-\u00e0-dire aux r\u00e9gimes de pension, aux heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, aux cong\u00e9s de maladie, aux r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations d'int\u00e9rim et aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[...] La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards garantira que l'ensemble des rajustements n\u00e9cessaires seront faits quant \u00e0 tous les avantages et quant \u00e0 toutes les primes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Par cons\u00e9quent, les employ\u00e9s qui y ont droit devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9dommag\u00e9s quant \u00e0 tout avantage financier qui a un lien avec le taux du salaire de base220.\n(ii) La position de l'Alliance [859] L'Alliance a appel\u00e9 M. Don Lee \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner devant le Tribunal en octobre 1995. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 par le Tribunal d'expert en analyse contractuelle et en \u00e9valuation de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte.\n[860] M. Lee a obtenu un baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts en 1968 \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Waterloo et une ma\u00eetrise en sciences politiques \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Queens. Il a par la suite \u00e9tudi\u00e9 au London School of Economics gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une bourse du Conseil des Arts du Canada et il y a obtenu un doctorat en \u00e9tudes politiques en 1980. Il a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re comme actuaire adjoint chez un comp\u00e9titeur de Hay o\u00f9 il s'occupait des calculs associ\u00e9s aux \u00e9valuations de r\u00e9gime de retraite, un travail qui \u00e9tait compatible avec ses \u00e9tudes ant\u00e9rieures de premier cycle en math\u00e9matiques. Par la suite, il a travaill\u00e9 comme directeur adjoint \u00e0 la recherche et \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation au Congr\u00e8s du travail du Canada o\u00f9 il s'est occup\u00e9 de l'\u00e9laboration d'une politique de prestations de r\u00e9gime de retraite et a donn\u00e9 des conseils techniques aux syndicats en mati\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociation de r\u00e9gimes de retraite et d'autres avantages comme l'assurance-maladie des retrait\u00e9s. Durant la p\u00e9riode 1977-1978, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 contrat par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du travail de l'Ontario pour coordonner la participation de celle-ci \u00e0 la Commission royale de l'Ontario sur les r\u00e9gimes de retraite. M. Lee travaille comme consultant ind\u00e9pendant depuis 1979. Sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Union Pension Services Ltd., se concentre sur deux aspects principaux des r\u00e9gimes de retraite et des avantages connexes : premi\u00e8rement, elle fournit du soutien technique aux syndicats \u00e0 la table de n\u00e9gociation et, deuxi\u00e8mement, elle offre des cours ainsi que de la formation aux membres du syndicat. La client\u00e8le de M. Lee \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de syndicats oeuvrant au sein de nombreuses entreprises canadiennes bien connues ainsi que de nombreux syndicats du secteur public de l'Ontario.\n[861] M. Lee a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 contrat par l'Alliance en juin 1995 pour comparer les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte du groupe CR avec celles des sous-groupes PO EXT et PO INT, pour la p\u00e9riode de temps pertinente \u00e0 la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire entre ao\u00fbt 1983 et l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1995. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait examin\u00e9 divers r\u00e9gimes d'avantages sp\u00e9ciaux du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ainsi que des rapports de certains experts-conseils sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte. Il a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 14 conventions collectives relatives aux employ\u00e9s CR et PO concern\u00e9s, lesquelles \u00e9taient en vigueur pour cette p\u00e9riode de temps. Le rapport de M. Lee a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce PSAC-55.\n[862] M. Lee a mentionn\u00e9 que l'Alliance lui avait demand\u00e9 d'exclure de son \u00e9tude les avantages pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la Loi. Il s'agit d'avantages qui sont accord\u00e9s et qui ne sont pas r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre des actes discriminatoires. L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n15 (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\nf) le fait pour un employeur, une organisation patronale ou une organisation syndicale d'accorder \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e un cong\u00e9 ou des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa grossesse ou \u00e0 son accouchement, ou d'accorder \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s un cong\u00e9 ou des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux leur permettant de prendre soin de leurs enfants.\n[863] En comparant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient chaque groupe CR et chaque groupe PO, M. Lee a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences qui existaient entre les deux groupes, puis il a calcul\u00e9 la valeur de ces diff\u00e9rences en fonction de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe \u00e9quivalente. Dans le but d'assurer un cadre coh\u00e9rent, il a class\u00e9 environ 51 \u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte en 9 cat\u00e9gories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[864] M. Lee a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il avait entrepris son \u00e9tude pour l'Alliance, il avait accept\u00e9 le principe (qu'il croyait avoir \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 endoss\u00e9 par la Commission) qu'une d\u00e9termination de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte devrait \u00eatre simple et facilement r\u00e9alisable par les employeurs et compr\u00e9hensible pour les employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, reconnaissant la difficult\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis lorsque l'on \u00e9value certaines composantes de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, il a estim\u00e9 que les diff\u00e9rences repr\u00e9sentant moins de 0,1 p. 100 des salaires n'\u00e9taient pas importantes. M. Lee n'a pas inclu les diff\u00e9rences individuelles de cet ordre dans ses calculs de comparaison.\n[865] M. Lee a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait limit\u00e9 son analyse aux formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte comprises dans les conventions collectives alors en vigueur. Il a donc travaill\u00e9 avec les conventions collectives applicables aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein CR et PO qui \u00e9taient en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1995.\n[866] M. Lee a confirm\u00e9, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, que son rapport ne comprenait pas, dans sa liste d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, la fourniture d'uniformes et de v\u00eatements de protection aux employ\u00e9s PO, laquelle avantageait clairement ce groupe. Il ne comprenait pas non plus d'\u00e9l\u00e9ment relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi\/changement technologique.\n[867] M. Lee a toutefois entrepris un examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences historiques d\u00e9coulant des conventions collectives qui \u00e9taient en vigueur entre 1983 et 1994. Son examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que plusieurs des diff\u00e9rences historiques \u00e9taient peu importantes. De nombreuses autres diff\u00e9rences \u00e9taient temporaires et ont ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9es au cours du processus normal de la n\u00e9gociation collective. Il a toutefois d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de calculer les valeurs \u00e9quivalentes en r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe pour ces diff\u00e9rences sans d\u00e9tenir un dossier complet de l'exp\u00e9rience des employ\u00e9s quant \u00e0 chacune des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, et ce, pour la p\u00e9riode de douze ans.\n[868] Le dernier paragraphe de la page 21 du rapport de M. Lee est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[Traduction]\nEt enfin, partout o\u00f9 un jugement entre directement dans le calcul, j'ai tent\u00e9 de sur\u00e9valuer la valeur des diff\u00e9rences favorisant le groupe CR et de sous-\u00e9valuer la valeur des diff\u00e9rences favorisant le groupe PO.\n[869] M. Lee a illustr\u00e9 la signification de ce point en donnant un exemple dans lequel il ne savait pas s'il devait classer un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte CR comme \u00e9tant \u00e9quivalent ou sup\u00e9rieur au m\u00eame \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte PO. Lorsqu'il a d\u00fbt prendre une d\u00e9cision, il a tent\u00e9 de classer l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte CR s'appliquant au groupe plaignant comme \u00e9tant plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reux que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte PO s'appliquant au groupe de comparaison.\n[870] Si sa d\u00e9cision devait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e, il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il pourrait affirmer qu'il avait peut-\u00eatre p\u00e9ch\u00e9 en sous-estimant la valeur de l'avantage pr\u00e9cis qui favorisait le groupe CR. Il a poursuivi en affirmant ce qui suit : [Traduction] il s'agit d'une sorte de principe actuariel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : dans le doute, formulez une pr\u00e9somption qui favorise le contraire de votre conclusion221 .\n[871] M. Lee a conclu, \u00e0 partir de son \u00e9tude, que, selon les conventions collectives en vigueur en 1995 relatives aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein CR et PO concern\u00e9s, il n'y avait essentiellement aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les deux groupes d'employ\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte.\n[872] Il a notamment mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLe point essentiel je crois est que la grande majorit\u00e9 des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte sont actuellement les m\u00eames ou \u00e9quivalentes et la mesure dans laquelle elles sont les m\u00eames ou \u00e9quivalentes repr\u00e9sente quelque chose comme 34 p. 100 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration222.\n[873] Il a de plus conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun motif raisonnable de calculer les diff\u00e9rences de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte entre les deux groupes d'employ\u00e9s pour la p\u00e9riode de 1983 \u00e0 1994 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les diff\u00e9rences qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9es \u00e9taient relativement peu importantes et souvent temporaire. De plus, un calcul fiable de la valeur des diff\u00e9rences exigerait une \u00e9tude intensive de l'exp\u00e9rience des employ\u00e9s pour chacune des mesures compensatrices, et ce, pour la p\u00e9riode de douze ans.\n[874] Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Lee a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte entre les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein CR et les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein PO qui devrait \u00eatre prise en compte pour \u00e9tablir s'il y avait une disparit\u00e9 salariale en vertu du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi.\n(iii) La position de Postes Canada [875] Postes Canada a appel\u00e9 M. Robert Bass \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en avril 2000, et celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 par le Tribunal d'expert en \u00e9tablissement de co\u00fbts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[876] M. Bass a obtenu en 1974 un baccalaur\u00e9at avec honneurs \u00e8s sciences avec sp\u00e9cialisation en math\u00e9matiques et en informatique de l'universit\u00e9 de Waterloo, dans le cadre de son programme Alternance travail-\u00e9tudes. Il a commenc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re au Conseil scolaire de Toronto o\u00f9 sa principale responsabilit\u00e9 consistait \u00e0 appuyer l'\u00e9quipe de n\u00e9gociation collective des enseignants du Conseil, notamment en rapport avec des questions complexe d'\u00e9tablissement de co\u00fbts. En 1977, il est devenu directeur, Recherche et Renseignements, pour l'Association des h\u00f4pitaux de l'Ontario o\u00f9 il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un d\u00e9partement de recherche pleinement fonctionnel dont le r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 fournir du soutien en recherche et donn\u00e9es aux \u00e9quipes de n\u00e9gociation des h\u00f4pitaux membres. M. Bass a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un mod\u00e8le informatis\u00e9 de co\u00fbts d'indemnisation totale pour l'Association, lequel permettait de suivre de pr\u00e8s les salaires et les autres formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dans les conventions collectives des h\u00f4pitaux. Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 80, M. Bass a cr\u00e9\u00e9 sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'expert-conseil, mieux connu sous le nom de Bass Associates Ltd., laquelle fournit une gamme compl\u00e8te de services de soutien en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail aux parties patronales dans le secteur public en Ontario, en Alberta et en C.-B. Ses clients comprenaient une large gamme de fournisseurs dans des domaines de service comme l'\u00e9ducation, la sant\u00e9, les services de police et les maisons d'accueil pour personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es. M. Bass est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans la fourniture aux employeurs d'analyses de co\u00fbts et de bases de donn\u00e9es, lesquelles sont particuli\u00e8rement importantes pour la partie patronale dans le cadre du processus de n\u00e9gociation collective. Depuis l'adoption par l'Ontario en 1987 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale, M. Bass et ses associ\u00e9s ont de plus en plus \u00e9labor\u00e9 avec des clients, des plans de parit\u00e9 salariale non fond\u00e9s sur le sexe, souvent \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle provinciale, lesquels exigent la participation des employeurs et des syndicats. In\u00e9vitablement, ces plans demandent une appr\u00e9ciation pr\u00e9cise de la valeur totale des programmes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe et avantages sp\u00e9ciaux) \u00e0 des fins de comparaison dans le contexte du processus de n\u00e9gociation collective.\n[877] M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'est pas inhabituel que l'\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts soit une question majeure lorsque l'on traite de la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte dans le cadre de n\u00e9gociations de conventions collectives. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il est important pour l'employeur et pour le syndicat ainsi que pour les employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s de conna\u00eetre le co\u00fbt des demandes particuli\u00e8res qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans le cours des n\u00e9gociations. Il est extr\u00eamement important pour l'employeur d'obtenir ces renseignements, car c'est l'employeur qui doit voir \u00e0 ce que l'entreprise soit capable d'assumer l'ensemble des co\u00fbts n\u00e9goci\u00e9s.\n[878] Selon M. Bass, lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 des situations de convention collective, il est souvent n\u00e9cessaire que les parties aux n\u00e9gociations \u00e9laborent un mod\u00e8le d'\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe et pour la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte. Ce mod\u00e8le doit traiter de la question du co\u00fbt de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte existante pour une ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, puis \u00e9tablir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le co\u00fbt des avantages major\u00e9s ou diminu\u00e9s pour les ann\u00e9es qui font l'objet de la n\u00e9gociation.\n[879] Selon M. Bass, cette exigence quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9cision peut entra\u00eener l'utilisation de techniques d'extraction de donn\u00e9es, l'identification d'hypoth\u00e8ses, et la mod\u00e9lisation par simulation informatique pour recueillir et analyser l'usage fait par l'employ\u00e9 pertinent et autres renseignements pour chaque avantage. La mod\u00e9lisation du taux de changement anticip\u00e9 et le co\u00fbt de ce changement pour l'employeur sont d'une importance cruciale dans ces \u00e9valuations.\n[880] M. Bass a confirm\u00e9 que le mandat qu'il s'est vu confier par Postes Canada consistait \u00e0 examiner et \u00e0 critiquer le rapport de M. Lee et [Traduction] [...] \u00e0 examiner ses m\u00e9thodes, ses hypoth\u00e8ses, sa m\u00e9thodologie et faire part de ses observations223 . Le rapport de M. Bass a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e comme pi\u00e8ce R-547.\n[881] Dans sa critique, M. Bass en a trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 redire contre le rapport de M. Lee pour plusieurs motifs.\n[882] Premi\u00e8rement, M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Lee avait commis une erreur m\u00e9thodologique en fondant son analyse sur les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte qui existaient en 1995. M. Bass a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il aurait plut\u00f4t utilis\u00e9 l'ann\u00e9e 1983 comme ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence parce qu'il aurait recherch\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences dans les avantages sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[883] Deuxi\u00e8mement, M. Bass n'a pas souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de M. Lee de rejeter les diff\u00e9rences individuelles en avantages sp\u00e9ciaux de moins de 0,1 p. 100 au motif que la somme d'un grand nombre de petits nombres peut \u00e9galer un grand nombre. M. Bass aurait inclus ces diff\u00e9rences dans son analyse.\n[884] Troisi\u00e8mement, M. Bass n'a pas souscrit \u00e0 l'exclusion de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi par M. Lee de son analyse et a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de M. Lee quant \u00e0 la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi comme \u00e9tant un avantage auquel il [Traduction] [...] [n'avait] pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de rattacher aucune valeur \u00e9quivalente en r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration [...]224 . M. Bass a affirm\u00e9 que, selon son exp\u00e9rience, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi \u00e9tait l'un des principaux points dans les n\u00e9gociations collectives. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait tellement d'importance dans les n\u00e9gociations collectives qu'elle devenait souvent le fondement de compromis dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation. En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sence d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments g\u00e9n\u00e9reux de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi dans les conventions collectives de Postes Canada signifiait qu'il \u00e9tait important d'\u00e9tablir le co\u00fbt de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi. Il croyait qu'on pouvait en \u00e9tablir le co\u00fbt et il a mentionn\u00e9 de nombreuses \u00e9tapes fondamentales pour y arriver.\n[885] Quatri\u00e8mement, M. Bass a contest\u00e9 l'exclusion des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la Loi. Bien que M. Bass ait reconnu que M. Lee suivait les directives que l'Alliance lui avait donn\u00e9es lorsqu'il n'a pas tenu compte de ces avantages sp\u00e9ciaux, il a mentionn\u00e9 que l'on aurait d\u00fb \u00e9tablir le co\u00fbt des \u00e9l\u00e9ments exclus. Il a fond\u00e9 cette opinion, encore une fois, sur le fait que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont souvent des questions cruciales dans les n\u00e9gociations collectives et, \u00e0 ce titre, ils m\u00e9riteraient d'\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s. Cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu nuanc\u00e9e lorsque M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tablirait, \u00e0 tout le moins, le co\u00fbt des avantages qui exc\u00e8dent les normes d'emploi minimales. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux comme le cong\u00e9 de paternit\u00e9 et le cong\u00e9 pour raisons familiales sont des exemples d'avantages sp\u00e9ciaux qui ne sont pas suffisamment r\u00e9pandus pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie des normes d'emploi minimales.\n[886] M. Bass a conclu que chacune des quatre lacunes d\u00e9crites ci-dessus, pourraient, individuellement, d\u00e9former la valeur des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte applicables aux groupes d'employ\u00e9s touch\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il a estim\u00e9 que l'ensemble des quatre lacunes que l'on retrouvait dans l'analyse de M. Lee \u00e9taient des lacunes fatales , rendant ainsi peu fiables les r\u00e9sultats du travail de ce dernier.\n(iv) L'analyse du Tribunal [887] Les parties ne contestent pas l'objet du paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi. Il d\u00e9finit la signification du mot salaire et comprend \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, lesquelles sont express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant payables en sus de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration payable \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 en contrepartie de son travail. L'ensemble des parties reconnaissent \u00e9galement que l'alin\u00e9a 11(7)e) exige que [les] autres avantages re\u00e7us directement ou indirectement de l'employeur soient compris dans la d\u00e9finition de salaire .\n[888] Par ailleurs, les parties ne contestent probablement pas l'application d'une r\u00e9paration de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards , si on en exige une. Alors que Postes Canada ne semble pas avoir utilis\u00e9 l'expression r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards dans ses observations, celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, par le t\u00e9moin de l'Alliance, M. Ranger, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par l'avocat de Postes Canada.\n[889] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la d\u00e9cision qu'elle a rendue le 18 mars 2004 dans la cause des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes , a renforc\u00e9 ce qu'elle a appel\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition tr\u00e8s large du mot salaire 225.\n[890] La Commission, dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate, a tir\u00e9 la conclusion tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration existant entre le groupe plaignant CR et le groupe de comparaison PO \u00e9tait probablement augment\u00e9 lorsque l'on tenait compte des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux ou de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte. Bien qu'elle n'ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve directe de cela, elle ne croyait pas que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte r\u00e9duirait l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration existant entre le groupe de comparaison et le groupe plaignant quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration directe.\n[891] La position de l'Alliance \u00e9tait qu'il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre la valeur de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte du groupe des employ\u00e9s CR et celle du groupe des employ\u00e9s PO. Cette position a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e dans le rapport de M. Lee, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur les conventions collectives des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein CR et PO qui \u00e9taient en vigueur en 1995. Un examen des diff\u00e9rences historiques entre 1983 et 1994 a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion de M. Lee qu'il n'y avait que des diff\u00e9rences relativement mineures et souvent temporaires dans la valeur de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des deux groupes quant \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode.\n[892] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa position que le rapport de M. Lee \u00e9tait erron\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, selon le t\u00e9moignage de son t\u00e9moin, M. Bass, il \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 caution. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait une critique du rapport Lee et n'offrait aucune appr\u00e9ciation des valeurs ou aucune comparaison des valeurs des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des groupes d'employ\u00e9s. Il a plut\u00f4t mentionn\u00e9 au Tribunal que les lacunes relev\u00e9es auraient pu mener \u00e0 une d\u00e9viation ou \u00e0 une distorsion dans les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par M. Lee dans son travail.\n[893] Comme toujours, le Tribunal doit tenir compte de la fiabilit\u00e9 dans le contexte des circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce de la plainte et il utilisera la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, laquelle est fond\u00e9e sur la norme civile de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[894] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 comme expert en analyse contractuelle et en \u00e9valuation de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, M. Lee avait comme mandat d'\u00e9tablir et de comparer la valeur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des groupes d'employ\u00e9s CR et PO.\n[895] M. Lee a soulign\u00e9 que, entre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et 1995, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il a remis son rapport, 13 conventions collectives ont impliqu\u00e9 Postes Canada, l'Alliance et les syndicats repr\u00e9sentant les PO. Le groupe PO a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'UFC, laquelle a par la suite fusionn\u00e9 avec le STTP. Quatre conventions parmi les 13 ont impliqu\u00e9 Postes Canada et l'UFC.\n[896] Le principal domaine d'examen de M. Lee \u00e9tait la convention collective en vigeur (1995) du groupe plaignant ainsi que celle du groupe de comparaison. Bien qu'il fut au courant des conventions ant\u00e9rieures, il n'y avait parfois dans certaines de celles-ci aucun renseignement quant \u00e0 certains avantages sp\u00e9ciaux pour certaines ann\u00e9es et parfois il y avait absence totale de renseignements concernant les avantages sp\u00e9ciaux. Pour ces avantages, lesquels il pouvait comparer avec les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, il a soulign\u00e9 que les diff\u00e9rences au fil des ans \u00e9taient mineures et \u00e9taient souvent temporaires.\n[897] Pour la p\u00e9riode de 1995, M. Lee a examin\u00e9 51 clauses de convention collective touchant les CR et les PO. Il a exclu huit clauses au complet et deux en partie, et ce, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la Loi, comme l'avait demand\u00e9 l'Alliance. Sur les 41 clauses restantes, il en a class\u00e9 24 comme accordant \u00e0 chaque groupe le m\u00eame avantage sp\u00e9cial ou un avantage \u00e9quivalent. Huit autres clauses avaient comport\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences dans des conventions ant\u00e9rieures mais \u00e9taient actuellement les m\u00eames ou l'\u00e9quivalent.\n[898] Huit clauses favorisaient soit les CR, soit les PO. Six favorisaient le groupe PO et deux, le groupe CR. M. Lee avait re\u00e7u comme instruction de la part de l'Alliance que, en cas de doute, il devrait choisir la solution qui r\u00e9duirait tout \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Il a tent\u00e9 de faire cela, comme il l'a soulign\u00e9 (paragraphes [868] \u00e0 [870]) en utilisant le principe de pratique actuarielle suivant [...] [Traduction] qui favorise le contraire de votre conclusion .\n[899] Compte tenu de sa comparaison des conventions collectives et de ses calculs des valeurs des avantages individuels, M. Lee a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence importante entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des deux groupes, \u00e0 l'exception de la fourniture d'uniformes et de v\u00eatements de protection pour le groupe PO, laquelle founiture, selon ses estimations, [Traduction] peut \u00e9quivaloir jusqu'\u00e0 2,08 p. 100 du salaire .\n[900] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, l'expert de Postes Canada en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9tablissement de co\u00fbt de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, M. Bass, a \u00e9t\u00e9 mandat\u00e9 pour critiquer le travail de M. Lee. On ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 d'appr\u00e9cier et de comparer la valeur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des deux groupes d'employ\u00e9s.\n[901] M. Bass a critiqu\u00e9 le rapport de M. Lee pour plusieurs raisons et a conclu que chacune des lacunes relev\u00e9es aurait pu changer la conclusion de M. Lee en d\u00e9formant la valeur des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte.\n[902] M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 que le choix de l'ann\u00e9e est critique lorsque l'on fait une analyse comparative de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, car l'ann\u00e9e choisie servira de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence lors de n\u00e9gociations collectives ult\u00e9rieures et de conventions \u00e9ventuelles. En l'esp\u00e8ce, il a soulign\u00e9 que l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aurait constitu\u00e9 un meilleur choix. M. Bass aurait aim\u00e9 \u00eatre capable de voir clairement les changements dans les co\u00fbts de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre 1983 et 1995, et, de ce fait, prendre note de ce que M. Lee a appel\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences mineures ou transitoires afin d'en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion d\u00e9finitive.\n[903] M. Bass a admis qu'il avait compris que les renseignements quant \u00e0 certains avantages sp\u00e9ciaux n'\u00e9taient pas facilement accessibles ou n'\u00e9taient tout simplement pas disponibles, et ce, quant \u00e0 l'ensemble des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. Dans d'autres cas, on ne disposait pas de moyens automatiques, ce qui a exig\u00e9 l'utilisation de moyens manuels d'extraction de donn\u00e9es, lesquels \u00e9taient plus dispendieux. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que sa m\u00e9thode d\u00e9pend\u00eet de l'obtention de donn\u00e9es exactes, il n'\u00e9tait pas rare de rencontrer des situations o\u00f9 les employeurs estimaient qu'ils ne pouvaient pas fournir de donn\u00e9es convenables. Dans de telles circonstances, il croyait que l'on devait explorer plus \u00e0 fond, et peut-\u00eatre faire affaire avec les repr\u00e9sentants de l'employeur qui sont proches du fonctionnement. Compte tenu des volumineux registres remplis \u00e0 la main, M. Bass a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il pourrait \u00eatre dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avec un \u00e9chantillon de taille raisonnable, pourvu qu'il ait l'assurance de recevoir des donn\u00e9es repr\u00e9sentatives.\n[904] Le Tribunal est d'avis que la premi\u00e8re critique formul\u00e9e par M. Bass \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du travail de M. Lee en rapport avec le fait qu'il ait choisi l'ann\u00e9e 1995 comme ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, plut\u00f4t que l'ann\u00e9e 1983, est bien fond\u00e9e en tant qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 th\u00e9orique de l'ann\u00e9e la plus convenable pour commencer l'analyse des diff\u00e9rences entre les groupes quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte. Dans les circonstances, toutefois, cette opinion ne peut pas se voir accorder suffisamment de poids pour supplanter le travail effectu\u00e9 sur les donn\u00e9es disponibles de 1995. Il manquait un certain nombre de renseignements. D'autres renseignements n'\u00e9taient pas facilement accessibles. M. Lee, un t\u00e9moin appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par l'Alliance \u00e0 l'audience du Tribunal, ne pouvait tout simplement pas demander \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e, Postes Canada, de lui fournir des renseignements. M\u00eame s'il avait pu le faire, la preuve ult\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que certains de ces renseignements n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles.\n[905] La deuxi\u00e8me critique de M. Bass avait trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de M. Lee de rejeter les diff\u00e9rences de moins de 0,1 p. 100 dans la valeur des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux. Bien que le Tribunal comprenne le point de M. Bass quant au co\u00fbt total possible d'une s\u00e9rie d'avantages d'une diff\u00e9rence de moins de 0,1 p. 100, il n'a donn\u00e9 aucune preuve concr\u00e8te pour illustrer quelle incidence cela pourrait avoir sur la d\u00e9finition de salaire.\n[906] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'accorde pas beaucoup de poids \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9tendue lacune dans le rapport de M. Lee.\n[907] M. Lee et M. Bass ne se sont pas entendus quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer un avantage comme la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi , la troisi\u00e8me source d'inqui\u00e9tude de M. Bass. Bien que M. Lee ait class\u00e9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi comme faisant partie des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux des employ\u00e9s compris dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, il a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas de moyen raisonnable d'associer une valeur \u00e9quivalente en salaire \u00e0 un tel avantage, car il d\u00e9pend d'un usage futur qui ne peut pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9dit de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise.\n[908] M. Bass n'est pas de cet avis. Il a estim\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tablissement du co\u00fbt de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement important dans des industries, comme les op\u00e9rations postales, o\u00f9 le changement technologique est chose courante. Il a toutefois soulign\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tablissement du co\u00fbt d'un tel avantage exigerait l'acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es pertinentes sur les employ\u00e9s comme le nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui risquent v\u00e9ritablement ou potentiellement d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires, le facteur temps en cause ainsi que d'autres facteurs connexes.\n[909] Alors que les deux t\u00e9moins experts ont reconnu que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi est un avantage sp\u00e9cial, il est \u00e9vident, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, que M. Lee n'avait pas acc\u00e8s aux renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour entreprendre l'\u00e9tablissement du co\u00fbt, si approximatif soit-il, de sa valeur. Le moment choisi pour faire son \u00e9tude, c'est-\u00e0-dire le milieu de la pr\u00e9sente audience, n'\u00e9tait pas non plus propice.\n[910] Compte tenu de la nature n\u00e9buleuse de l'\u00e9tablissement du co\u00fbt de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi et de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des deux t\u00e9moins dans leur champ d'expertise respectif, le Tribunal accepte que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi est probablement l'un des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux qui est susceptible d'\u00eatre de valeur \u00e9quivalente dans le cas de presque tous les employ\u00e9s CR et PO. De plus, la preuve indique que ceci pourrait \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement le cas dans une industrie o\u00f9 le changement technologique est courant, comme un organisme moderne de cueillette, de traitement et de livraison du courrier.\n[911] Enfin, M. Bass a mentionn\u00e9 qu'une comparaison d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de la valeur de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte des CR et des PO n\u00e9cessiterait l'\u00e9valuation des diverses \u00e9l\u00e9ments exclues par M. Lee. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments concernent les cong\u00e9s principaux, pay\u00e9s et non pay\u00e9s, de maternit\u00e9, de paternit\u00e9 et d'adoption, de m\u00eame que les cong\u00e9s pour raisons familiales ou les cong\u00e9s parentaux.\n[912] Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9coulent de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la Loi et repr\u00e9sentent des avantages qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s non discriminatoires par la Loi. Pour cette raison, M. Lee a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'Alliance lui avait demand\u00e9 de les exclurent de son analyse.\n[913] M. Bass a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e9tabli le co\u00fbt des avantages de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) - ou du moins, de ceux qui d\u00e9passaient les normes d'emploi minimales. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait habituellement pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une r\u00e9ussite, dans les cercles de n\u00e9gociation collective, de se contenter de n\u00e9gocier qu'en fonction des normes minimales de l'emploi. Il serait toutefois une r\u00e9ussite de n\u00e9gocier et de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 obtenir des avantages qui d\u00e9passent ces normes et, il serait, par cons\u00e9quent, vital de conna\u00eetre les co\u00fbts de ces avantages.\n[914] Dans les circonstances du rapport de M. Lee, M. Bass a admis qu'une telle \u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts est impossible \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sans la disponibilit\u00e9 de donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 l'utilisation pour chacun des avantages, ce que M. Lee n'avait pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'acceptation par M. Lee de ses instructions d'exclure les avantages touch\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la Loi \u00e9tait compr\u00e9hensible compte tenu de la nature de la plainte, du libell\u00e9 clair du paragraphe et de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires.\n[915] De m\u00eame, sans la capacit\u00e9 de faire une \u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts, le commentaire de M. Bass que la plus grande partie des dispositions de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) semblait favoriser le groupe CR n'\u00e9tait que pure supposition226.\n[916] M. Lee, ci-dessus, ne faisait pas non plus une supposition concernant des avantages qu'il \u00e9tait incapable d'\u00e9valuer ou qu'il croyait faire partie de la pratique administrative de Postes Canada. Il a formul\u00e9 ce qui suit quant aux avantages comme le cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9veloppement de la carri\u00e8re et le cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour examen dont ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s CR pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es avant 1995, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 le groupe PO les a n\u00e9goci\u00e9s pour son groupe :\n[Traduction]\n[...] J'ai du mal \u00e0 imaginer que Postes Canada, avant la conclusion de leur contrat le plus r\u00e9cent, n'accordait pas de cong\u00e9s aux PO pour des examens importants.\nJe soup\u00e7onne que dans le cas de certaines de ces diff\u00e9rences, il y avait des pratiques de gestion administrative [...] qui \u00e9taient en place, peut-\u00eatre depuis des ann\u00e9es, mais qui n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites dans le contrat [...]227\n[917] Aucune des suppositions de l'expert n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve entendue par le Tribunal.\n[918] Toutefois, le rapport de M. Lee pr\u00e9sente l'image de la valeur de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait le groupe plaignant et le groupe de comparaison comme \u00e9tant, selon toute vraisemblance, de valeur \u00e9quivalente, et li\u00e9e, dans un mod\u00e8le de n\u00e9gociation, \u00e0 la valeur des salaires vers\u00e9s aux deux groupes.\n[919] La critique formul\u00e9 par M. Bass n'a pas persuad\u00e9 le Tribunal que le rapport de M. Lee devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. En effet, il a soulign\u00e9 qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire que l'on dispose de donn\u00e9es et de documents afin que l'on puisse faire du travail plus pr\u00e9cis. Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la capacit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis a \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement r\u00e9duite en raison du manque de donn\u00e9es convenables n\u00e9cessaires pour cette pr\u00e9cision. Ce manque de pr\u00e9cision est toutefois loin d'avoir comme cons\u00e9quence que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le rapport de M. Lee ne puisse pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e comme prouvant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que, selon toute vraisemblance, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte du groupe plaignant et celle du groupe de comparaison \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9quivalentes.\n[920] Il reste une autre question \u00e0 examiner, laquelle a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration que Postes Canada a fait \u00e0 la page 264 du chapitre 11 de ses observations \u00e9crites, c'est-\u00e0-dire :\n[Traduction]\nToute analyse d'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vertu de l'article 11 est incompl\u00e8te et impr\u00e9cise sans une analyse de l'ensemble des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte. Une analyse compl\u00e8te est non seulement n\u00e9cessaire; c'est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment exig\u00e9 par l'article 11 et, par cons\u00e9quent, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel d'une preuve prima facie.\n[921] La question r\u00e9sultante que le Tribunal doit trancher est la suivante : une analyse raisonnablement fiable a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprise par la plaignante quant aux composantes indirectes de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration afin de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l'article 11 de la Loi?\n[922] Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal accepte, \u00e0 partir de la preuve, que la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle l'examen des composantes indirectes a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en l'esp\u00e8ce est loin de ce \u00e0 quoi on aurait pu s'attendre quant \u00e0 une \u00e9tude conjointe employeur-employ\u00e9 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale . Elle n'est pas pr\u00e8s de ce que l'on pourrait consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant une pratique normale ou accept\u00e9e. Ni la Commission, ni l'Alliance n'ont trait\u00e9 de l'affaire lors de l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Alliance, durant le processus d'audience de la plainte, le soin d'embaucher M. Lee, un expert en analyse contractuel et en \u00e9valuation de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte pour entreprendre une \u00e9tude d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. Cette \u00e9tude comportait, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, l'examen de nombreuses conventions collectives et de nombreux r\u00e9gimes d'avantages sp\u00e9ciaux qui existaient durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Ces conventions et ces r\u00e9gimes ont impliqu\u00e9 Postes Canada et les deux syndicats repr\u00e9sentant le groupe plaignant CR et le groupe de comparaison PO.\n[923] Tel qu'elle appara\u00eet dans son rapport PSAC-55, la conclusion de M. Lee, contest\u00e9e du point de vue de la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e par M. Bass, \u00e9tait que les dispositions contractuelles en vigueur quant \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte \u00e9taient [Traduction] exactement les m\u00eames ou \u00e9taient \u00e9quivalentes d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale . Lorsqu'il y avait des diff\u00e9rences, M. Lee a estim\u00e9 qu'elles \u00e9taient mineures et que, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas [Traduction] elles n'avaient aucune valeur \u00e9quivalente en salaire qui pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme importante aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale . Il a poursuivi en concluant qu'[Traduction] il n'existe aucune diff\u00e9rence dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte qui devrait \u00eatre incluse dans le calcul des rajustements qui peuvent devoir \u00eatre faits quant au groupe plaignant CR.\n[924] Le travail de M. Lee, malgr\u00e9 les critiques de M. Bass, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente section de la d\u00e9cision, constitue-t-il une r\u00e9ponse raisonnablement fiable \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'examiner l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi?\n[925] Durant l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, aucun \u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la plaignante ou par la Commission, malgr\u00e9 le fait que la Loi exige un recensement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui font partie de la d\u00e9finition de salaire (paragraphe 11(7)).\n[926] M. Lee a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par la plaignante bien apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience, et, en cons\u00e9quence de son embauche tardive, celui-ci n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier les donn\u00e9es relatives aux avantages ou d'\u00e9tablir leurs co\u00fbts. Il a fait du mieux qu'il a pu, compte tenu de la situation \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait confront\u00e9.\n[927] Compte tenu de ces circonstances, le Tribunal s'est inspir\u00e9 de la m\u00e9thode du spectre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t pour traiter de la fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable des renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s par l'\u00c9quipe professionnelle dans ses \u00e9valuations des emplois (paragraphe [696]). Le Tribunal a conclu qu'il ne pouvait pas qualifier le rapport de M. Lee ainsi que ses r\u00e9sultats comme \u00e9tant d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure ou d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable moyenne . Le Tribunal conclut toutefois que sa m\u00e9thode et les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure .\n[928] Le fait que l'analyse a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 un mauvais moment, par un seul t\u00e9moin expert, et a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les valeurs \u00e9quivalentes en salaire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte pour le groupe plaignant CR et pour le groupe de comparaison PO, s'\u00e9quilibraient sensiblement, ne signifie pas, selon le Tribunal, que le paragraphe 11(7) n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Il ne signifie pas non plus que l'analyse de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te ou forc\u00e9ment inexacte.\n[929] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l'Alliance, par l'entremise du t\u00e9moignage de M. Lee, a satisfait aux exigences de la Loi en examinant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte figurant au paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi, lesquels sont compris dans la d\u00e9finition de salaire .\n[930] Le Tribunal conclut \u00e9galement que l'Alliance a satisfait \u00e0 l'exigence de la preuve prima facie en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi en prouvant, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lee et, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'il n'y avait essentiellement, entre le groupe des employ\u00e9s CR et le groupe des employ\u00e9s PO, aucune diff\u00e9rence quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte dont on devrait tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider s'il y avait disparit\u00e9 salariale en vertu du paragraphe 11(1).\nIX. LES R\u00c9PARATIONS A. Contexte [931] Les dispositions suivantes de la Loi traitent de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'accorder des r\u00e9parations :\nPlainte jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e\n53(2) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\n[...]\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\ne) d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\nIndemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale\n53(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\nInt\u00e9r\u00eats\n53(4) Sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 48.9, le membre instructeur peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l'indemnit\u00e9 au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu'il estime justifi\u00e9s.\n[932] Manifestement, le Tribunal s'est vu conf\u00e9rer de vastes pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration par l'article 53 de la Loi pour rem\u00e9dier aux cons\u00e9quences de la discrimination lorsqu'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en vertu de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e.\n[933] Comme la Commission l'a soulign\u00e9 dans ses observations, ces pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration devraient permettre \u00e0 la victime d'un traitement ou d'une pratique discriminatoire d' obtenir une r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale . La Commission a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration suivante faite par le juge Marceau dans la d\u00e9cision Morgan alors qu'il traitait de l'\u00e9valuation en droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle ou en droit de la personne des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats recouvrables par une victime :\nDans les deux cas, le principe est le m\u00eame : la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e doit \u00eatre remise dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit. Tout autre but entra\u00eenerait un enrichissement sans cause et un appauvrissement injustifi\u00e9 parall\u00e8le228.\n[934] La meilleure fa\u00e7on d'interpr\u00e9ter l'expression obtenir une r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale est comme signifiant que la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e doit \u00eatre remise dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit.\n[935] Il est \u00e9galement pertinent de mentionner, comme la Commission l'a fait dans ses observations, l'examen fait par le juge Hugessen de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi alors que lui et ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient saisis d'une cause de parit\u00e9 salariale :\nSelon moi, cette disposition conf\u00e8re simplement et explicitement le pouvoir d'ordonner le paiement \u00e0 une victime des pertes de salaire qu'elle a subies en raison d'un acte discriminatoire. Pareille ordonnance est n\u00e9cessairement ax\u00e9e sur le pass\u00e9 et r\u00e9sulte de la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la question suivante : Quelle est la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dont cette victime a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence de l'acte discriminatoire? Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de cette disposition ne justifie l'opinion selon laquelle cette r\u00e9paration doit \u00eatre obtenue \u00e0 tout le moins de fa\u00e7on minimale , ou qu'elle ne doit pas remonter au-del\u00e0 de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de [la] plainte . Une plainte pour cause de discrimination renvoie n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 des pratiques ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la plainte m\u00eame; on peut difficilement se plaindre d'un acte discriminatoire qui ne serait pas encore survenu. Certes, la discrimination peut se poursuivre, de sorte que le Tribunal accordera \u00e9galement r\u00e9paration pour le futur, mais ce fait ne doit pas occulter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente de r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice pass\u00e9229.\n[936] Dans cette m\u00eame d\u00e9cision MDN susmentionn\u00e9e, le juge Hugessen a fait la d\u00e9claration suivante qu'il a \u00e9tay\u00e9e en citant un extrait pertinent tir\u00e9 de l'ouvrage de S.M. Waddam, lequel a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe [679] :\n\u00c0 mon avis, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la Cour, sachant que la partie demanderesse a subi des dommages, ne peut refuser d'accorder r\u00e9paration uniquement parce que le montant pr\u00e9cis des dommages est difficile ou impossible \u00e0 \u00e9tablir. Le juge doit faire de son mieux \u00e0 l'aide des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il dispose230.\n[937] Il y a un autre facteur contextuel important dont il faut tenir compte. Celui-ci a trait \u00e0 l'incidence possible, sur une adjudication de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, de toute incertitude quant \u00e0 la nature, l'\u00e9tendue et la valeur des pertes encourues. Le juge Marceau a trait\u00e9 de cette question. Il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nIl me semble qu'il ne faut pas confondre la preuve d'une perte v\u00e9ritable et de son lien avec l'acte discriminatoire avec la preuve de l'ampleur de la perte. Pour d\u00e9montrer l'existence du pr\u00e9judice donnant droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l'acte discriminatoire, le plaignant aurait certainement obtenu le poste. De plus, aux fins d'\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice, point n'est besoin de d\u00e9montrer la probabilit\u00e9 de celui-ci. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve d'une possibilit\u00e9, pourvu qu'elle soit s\u00e9rieuse, suffit \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l'existence du pr\u00e9judice. Par contre, pour conna\u00eetre l'ampleur du pr\u00e9judice et les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il entra\u00eene, il m'appara\u00eet impossible de rejeter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que, de toute mani\u00e8re, le poste aurait pu \u00eatre refus\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sence de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'incertitude emp\u00eacherait le tribunal d'accorder les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il accorderait en l'absence de celui-ci. L'indemnit\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par le tribunal serait r\u00e9duite en fonction du degr\u00e9 d'incertitude231. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[938] Deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes qui illustrent le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le juge Marceau ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attention du Tribunal. L'une de ces d\u00e9cisions est Chopra c. Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et du Bien-\u00eatre social, dans laquelle le plaignant demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour une perte de salaire d\u00e9coulant du fait qu'il n'avait pas obtenu une affectation int\u00e9rimaire et qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 comme candidat \u00e9ligible dans un concours relatif \u00e0 un poste de niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 au sein de son minist\u00e8re232. Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 au plaignant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats beaucoup moins importants en raison du degr\u00e9 relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'incertitude quant \u00e0 sa possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussite lors du concours final. Cette d\u00e9cision fait actuellement l'objet d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[939] La deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision est Singh c. Statistique Canada, dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu que le plaignant avait fait l'objet de discrimination en raison de son \u00e2ge parce que son nom n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit sur une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 relative \u00e0 des postes particuliers \u00e0 Statistique Canada233. Toutefois, des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s au plaignant en tenant compte qu'on lui accorderait un poste et un traitement inf\u00e9rieur de deux \u00e9chelons au poste et au traitement demand\u00e9s par lui et la CCDP au motif qu' il n'[\u00e9tait] pas du tout certain que la progression de M. Singh aurait suivi le chemin que celui-ci anticipait234. La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale235.\n[940] Alors que la pr\u00e9sence de l'incertitude lorsqu'il est question d'\u00e9tablir l'importance des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ne devrait pas, ne doit pas en fait, emp\u00eacher le Tribunal d'accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, cette incertitude peut, n\u00e9anmoins, entra\u00eener une r\u00e9duction, tr\u00e8s significative dans certaines circonstances, de la valeur du montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[941] Compte tenu de la classification faite par le Tribunal des renseignements sur l'emploi utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation des postes CR et des emplois PO comme \u00e9tant d' une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure (paragraphe [699]), le Tribunal conclut qu'il existe un degr\u00e9 important d'incertitude. Cette incertitude d\u00e9coule de la classification la plus basse dans la fourchette d'acceptabilit\u00e9 , laquelle l'emporte sur une \u00e9valuation des dommages occasionn\u00e9s par une perte de salaire pour un montant auquel on pourrait s'attendre si les renseignements sur l'emploi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure - le niveau le plus souhaitable pour une cause en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[942] Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment semblable d'incertitude d\u00e9coule de la classification, par le Tribunal, des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte comme \u00e9tant de fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure (paragraphe [927]).\n[943] Si ont tient compte de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'incertitude qui ont une incidence sur l'aspect tr\u00e8s important de l'appr\u00e9ciation de l'ampleur de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, le Tribunal cro\u00eet que, selon toute vraisemblance, si les renseignements sur l'emploi et les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure , l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus conforme \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. En d'autres mots, plus les renseignements sur l'emploi et les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte sont fiables, plus la d\u00e9termination de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est pr\u00e9cise. Cette d\u00e9termination est cruciale quant \u00e0 l'importance des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui seront adjug\u00e9s.\n[944] Reconnaissant ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'incertitude dans l'\u00e9tat des renseignements sur l'emploi et dans les documents sur les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte, le Tribunal conclut qu'il ne peut pas accepter, en totalit\u00e9, l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tablie par l'Alliance et endoss\u00e9e par la Commission.\nB. Les composantes de la r\u00e9paration (i) L'adjudication au titre de la perte de salaire [945] En somme, le Tribunal favorise la m\u00e9thode niveau\/courbe propos\u00e9e par M. Kervin et la Commission pour \u00e9tablir l'\u00e9tendue de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 \u00e9liminer (paragraphe [844]). M. Kervin et la Commission ont toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que leurs calculs de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n'\u00e9taient que des estimations. Le co\u00fbt final des rajustements individuels pour chaque employ\u00e9 CR exigera un examen des dossiers des employ\u00e9s en collaboration avec Postes Canada.\n[946] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal conclut que la question des renseignements sur l'emploi et la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une incertitude dans la d\u00e9termination de l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Cette incertitude, \u00e0 son tour, demande pour une r\u00e9duction de l'adjudication pour perte de salaire.\n[947] \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence des autres articles de la Loi, l'article 11 n'apporte pas de distinction nette entre la preuve de responsabilit\u00e9 et la preuve de pr\u00e9judice. Il ne propose pas non plus une m\u00e9thode claire pour mesurer le pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant d'une conclusion de discrimination. Il est donc n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal traite de la distinction entre la preuve de responsabilit\u00e9 et la preuve de pr\u00e9judice ainsi que des moyens de mesure du pr\u00e9judice possible.\n[948] Suite \u00e0 l'analyse spectrale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e quant \u00e0 ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'incertitude, le Tribunal conclut qu'un \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fond\u00e9 sur une preuve de fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable sup\u00e9rieure devrait, logiquement, donner lieu \u00e0 une adjudication \u00e0 100 p. 100 de la perte de salaire, une conclusion fond\u00e9e sur une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable moyenne \u00e0 une adjudication de 75 p. 100, et une conclusion fond\u00e9e sur une fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 une adjudication de 50 p. 100 ou moins.\n[949] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la proposition d\u00e9finitive d'adjudication au titre de la perte de salaire pour chaque employ\u00e9 CR admissible, peu importe la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e, devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite de 50 p. 100 en conformit\u00e9 avec l'\u00e9tat de fiabilit\u00e9 raisonnable inf\u00e9rieure des renseignements sur l'emploi pertinents et des formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte.\n(ii) Les arr\u00e9rages - La p\u00e9riode d'indemnisation [950] La Commission a demand\u00e9 que l'adjudication au titre de la perte de salaire soit r\u00e9troactive au 16 octobre 1981, la date de la constitution de Postes Canada en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 aux propos suivants tenus par le juge Hugessen dans la d\u00e9cision MDN, dans laquelle on a reconnu la capacit\u00e9 d'un tribunal \u00e0 s'\u00e9carter de la limite d'un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte fix\u00e9e par la pratique de la Commission :\nDans des circonstances ordinaires, la limite d'un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, fix\u00e9e par la pratique de la Commission me semble \u00e9tablir un juste \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s en jeu. Comme tout d\u00e9lai de prescription, ce d\u00e9lai est en quelque sorte arbitraire et j'en temp\u00e9rerais le caract\u00e8re arbitraire en statuant que le Tribunal peut le modifier s'il estime que les faits commandent qu'il soit prolong\u00e9 ou \u00e9court\u00e9 dans une instance donn\u00e9e236.\n[951] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision MDN, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et elle a fait valoir que la date de prise d'effet pour les calculs des pertes de salaire devrait \u00eatre le 16 octobre 1981. Selon l'Alliance, il serait injuste pour les victimes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique d'agir autrement.\n[952] Postes Canada a fait valoir que l'Alliance n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie que tout \u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dont Postes Canada pourrait \u00eatre tenue responsable en vertu de l'article 11 existait avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Postes Canada a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que le Tribunal, dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Phase II)237 dans laquelle l'intim\u00e9 a reconnu sa responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 11, n'a adjug\u00e9 aucun arr\u00e9rage pour une quelconque p\u00e9riode de temps avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. On a ordonn\u00e9 que le rajustement des salaires prenne effet \u00e0 compter de la date du d\u00e9but de l'\u00e9tude du Comit\u00e9 mixte - c'est-\u00e0-dire environ 3 mois et demi apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Selon Postes Canada, les faits en l'esp\u00e8ce ne favorisent pas le versement de paiements r\u00e9troactifs.\n[953] Le juge Hugessen dans la d\u00e9cision MDN, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, a mentionn\u00e9 que la port\u00e9e de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi est n\u00e9cessairement ax\u00e9e sur le pass\u00e9 lorsqu'il a ordonn\u00e9 le paiement des pertes de salaire occasionn\u00e9es par une pratique discriminatoire238.\n[954] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 24 ao\u00fbt 1983 mais, durant 1984 et 1985, elle n'a fait l'objet d'aucune enqu\u00eate active de la part de la Commission. L'Alliance et Postes Canada \u00e9taient occup\u00e9es \u00e0 autre chose \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, notamment \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration du plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois System One. La Commission a r\u00e9activ\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate en octobre 1985.\n[955] Le Tribunal estime que, compte tenu de la nature syst\u00e9mique de la discrimination en vertu de l'article 11, on devrait reconna\u00eetre une certaine p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9. En m\u00eame temps, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la d\u00e9cision Morgan, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, a affirm\u00e9 que l'on doit faire preuve de bon sens lorsque l'on cr\u00e9e une p\u00e9riode d'indemnisation et que l'on doit imposer une certaine limite \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'auteur du pr\u00e9judice.\n[956] Compte tenu qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour souligner l'argument que la pr\u00e9sente plainte devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente, le Tribunal conclut que l'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 la pratique fr\u00e9quente de la Commission de limiter cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte constituerait un \u00e9quilibre raisonnable en toutes circonstances. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que le 24 ao\u00fbt 1982 constitue la date de d\u00e9but appropri\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode d'indemnisation.\n[957] Quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps qui devrait \u00eatre couverte par les arr\u00e9rages de salaire, il est soulign\u00e9 que l'avocat de l'Alliance a pr\u00e9venu le Tribunal, en juin 2003, que l'Alliance et Postes Canada avaient conclu un protocole d'entente, en date du 6 juin 2002, en vertu de la convention collective alors en vigueur, lequel protocole pr\u00e9voyait l'introduction d'un nouveau plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. Le nouveau plan a remplac\u00e9 les normes de classification existantes du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et a cr\u00e9\u00e9 six niveaux administratifs, A1 \u00e0 A6, dans lesquels des anciens CR allaient \u00eatre reclass\u00e9s, s'il y avait lieu. La date de mise en uvre du nouveau plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 3 ao\u00fbt 2002 et la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur des nouveaux taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement au 3 juin 2002.\n[958] L'avocat de l'Alliance a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plage r\u00e9sultante des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des CR d\u00e9coulant du nouveau plan \u00e9tait, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que la plage des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des PO INT et des PO EXT en vertu de la convention du STTP expirant en janvier 2003. Qu'est-ce que tout cela signifiait?\n[959] Ce que cela signifiait pour l'avocat de l'Alliance, du point de vue de l'incidence sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte, a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 comme suit :\n[Traduction]\n\u00ab [...] cela indique la ligne de d\u00e9marcation de la limite ext\u00e9rieure de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale239 \u00bb.\n\u00ab [...] vraisemblablement, cela repr\u00e9sente la o\u00f9 la plainte prend fin, la limite ext\u00e9rieure, le param\u00e8tre ext\u00e9rieur de la plainte240 \u00bb.\n[960] La position de l'avocat de l'Alliance est renforc\u00e9e par le fait que le protocole d'entente du 6 juin 2002 \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat direct d'un protocole d'entente (annexe D) de la convention collective Postes Canada\/Alliance alors en vigueur et qui expirait le 31 octobre 2004. Dans ce protocole d'entente \u00e9tait conscrit l'agr\u00e9ment de Postes Canada et de l'Alliance (et du Syndicat des employ\u00e9s des postes et des communications) que le nouveau plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois envisag\u00e9 serait [Traduction] exempt de discrimination bas\u00e9e sur le sexe et devrait r\u00e9pondent aux exigences de l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne .\n[961] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la p\u00e9riode d'arr\u00e9rage de salaire sera la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 24 ao\u00fbt 1982 et le 2 juin 2002, apr\u00e8s quoi il ne devrait plus y avoir d'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre le groupe plaignant CR et le groupe de comparaison PO. De plus, le Tribunal conclut que, avec les nouveaux taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des anciens CR prenant effet le 3 juin 2002, on n'aura pas \u00e0 faire une inclusion dans les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de base par niveau \u00e0 cette date, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les nouveaux niveaux administratifs A1 \u00e0 A6, \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, \u00e9taient compatibles avec l'article 11.\n(iii) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [962] Le paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu'il estime justifi\u00e9s, dans toute ordonnance de paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 rendue en vertu de l'article 53. Une telle ordonnance est soumise aux r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies en vertu du paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi, lequel est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nR\u00e8gles de pratique\n48.9(2) Le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant, notamment\ni) l'adjudication des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[963] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que dans le pass\u00e9 il y a eu un d\u00e9bat quant \u00e0 savoir si le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne avait comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des int\u00e9r\u00eats car il n'y avait aucune disposition dans la Loi quant \u00e0 de telles adjudications. Une telle disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e dans les modifications apport\u00e9es en 1988 \u00e0 l'article 48.9 et au paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi.\n[964] Les trois parties ont renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (dat\u00e9e du 8 janvier 2000), lequel est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nInt\u00e9r\u00eats\n9(12) \u00c0 moins d'instructions contraires de la part du membre instructeur, tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne doivent\na) \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en utilisant le taux applicable aux obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada, et\nb) commencer \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 l'acte discriminatoire s'est produit.\n[965] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont compos\u00e9s de deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, notamment, d'une indemnisation quant \u00e0 la perte de rendement des sommes non vers\u00e9es ainsi que d'une indemnisation quant \u00e0 la perte de leur valeur. Elle a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles est une disposition provisoire et non une disposition d\u00e9finitive et qu'il permet au Tribunal d'adjuger des int\u00e9r\u00eats autrement que ce qui y est \u00e9nonc\u00e9.\n[966] Selon la Commission, les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce et le fait que les employ\u00e9s touch\u00e9s attendent un rajustement de salaire depuis plus de 20 ans justifiaient une adjudication plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse que ce qui est permis par le paragraphe 9(12). La Commission a demand\u00e9 une adjudication d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s au taux pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi sur tribunaux judiciaires, ce qui constituerait une indemnisation plus compl\u00e8te241.\n[967] La pr\u00e9tention de l'Alliance \u00e9tait que le Tribunal devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'adjuger des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 un taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et qu'il devrait favoriser l'adjudication d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s, calcul\u00e9s semestriellement, au taux pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[968] L'Alliance et la Commission ont estim\u00e9 que leurs positions respectives sur la question de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 \u00e9taient \u00e9tay\u00e9es par l'ouvrage de Waddams, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, dans lequel on a conclu que l'adjudication d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s, en tant que principe, pourrait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions.\n[969] La position de Postes Canada \u00e9tait qu'il ne conviendrait pas d'adjuger des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s sans d\u00e9montrer, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Morgan, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, l'existence d'un besoin ou d'une circonstance sp\u00e9cial quant \u00e0 l'indemnisation de la perte r\u00e9elle subie. Selon Postes Canada, ni la Commission, ni l'Alliance n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve pour \u00e9tayer une adjudication exceptionnelle d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s ou une adjudication d'un taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui des obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada.\n[970] Malgr\u00e9 la longue dur\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente cause, laquelle dur\u00e9e a occasionn\u00e9 un jugement tardif quant \u00e0 la cause des employ\u00e9s plaignants, le Tribunal conclut que la preuve dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi n'a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l'existence d'aucun besoin ou d'aucune circonstance sp\u00e9cial justifiant l'adjudication d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s.\n[971] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples devraient \u00eatre payables lors de l'adjudication d\u00e9finitive au titre de la perte de salaire, avec r\u00e9duction de 50 p. 100. Ces int\u00e9r\u00eats devraient \u00eatre fix\u00e9s selon le taux des obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada et commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 compter de la date du d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire le 24 ao\u00fbt 1982. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats devraient \u00eatre sur une base annuelle en utilisant le taux des obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada en vigueur le 1er septembre de chaque ann\u00e9e vis\u00e9e.\n(iv) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats apr\u00e8s jugement [972] Comme il est probable qu'il y aura des retards entre la date de la d\u00e9cision finale du Tribunal et la date de paiement des adjudications aux employ\u00e9s qui y ont droit, la Commission et l'Alliance ont fait valoir que des int\u00e9r\u00eats apr\u00e8s jugement devraient \u00eatre vers\u00e9s en conformit\u00e9 avec les dispositions de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[973] Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 cette opinion, sujet \u00e0 la condition que tout int\u00e9r\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement doit \u00eatre calcul\u00e9, \u00e0 partir de la date de l'Ordonnance du Tribunal, sur l'adjudication de la perte de salaire d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, r\u00e9duit de 50 p. cent.\n(v) Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [974] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve \u00e9tayait une conclusion par le Tribunal que Postes Canada a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment pos\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires et que le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale devrait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n[975] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que sans que ce soit de leur faute, les employ\u00e9s touch\u00e9s ont attendu pendant environ 20 ans pour que leur plainte soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. L'Alliance a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que les efforts ant\u00e9rieurs qu'elle a faits en vue de n\u00e9gocier une solution \u00e0 la table de n\u00e9gociation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s par l'employeur.\n[976] L'Alliance \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d'opinion que Postes Canada avait consciemment \u00e9vit\u00e9 de s'assurer que les fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par le groupe CR \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine \u00e9taient de valeur \u00e9gale \u00e0 celles ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par le groupe PO \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Au contraire, Postes Canada a choisi de ne faire valoir que des critiques et des arguments de nature technique et juridique con\u00e7us dans le but de se soustraire \u00e0 ses obligations pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 11.\n[977] Un autre argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'Alliance est l'incidence importante que la violation de l'article 11 par l'intim\u00e9e a eu, principalement, sur les petits salari\u00e9s du groupe CR. La privation du revenu constituant l'\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration peut raisonnablement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, dans des cas particuliers, comme ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions perdues et le Tribunal devrait en tenir compte dans son ordonnance rem\u00e9diatrice.\n[978] Enfin, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9ception et la frustration occasionn\u00e9es par le temps qu'il a fallu pour obtenir r\u00e9paration devraient \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9es par des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[979] Tout en reconnaissant qu'aucune indemnisation p\u00e9cuniaire ne peut pas vraiment effacer les r\u00e9percussions qu'ont eu tant d'ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration insuffisante, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que chacun des employ\u00e9s du groupe CR devrait recevoir une indemnisation en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi et que le montant de ladite indemnisation devrait \u00eatre fix\u00e9 par le Tribunal. L'Alliance a propos\u00e9 que l'adjudication soit r\u00e9partie au prorata en fonction du nombre d'ann\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes travaill\u00e9es par chacun des employ\u00e9s \u00e9ligibles.\n[980] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 taux simple calcul\u00e9s en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l'Ontario devraient \u00eatre vers\u00e9s quant \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\n[981] La Commission a soulign\u00e9 que, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral ainsi qu'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. La Commission a toutefois mentionn\u00e9 que dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, elle n'avait pris aucune position quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'Alliance.\n[982] Postes Canada a fait valoir qu'il ne convenait pas d'adjuger une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en l'esp\u00e8ce et pr\u00e9tendu que l'Alliance n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal aucune preuve de la nature de celle qui est exig\u00e9e pour \u00e9tayer une telle demande.\n[983] Postes Canada a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que le droit concernant les indemnit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales est clair et que le tribunal l'a bien \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Phase II). Voici ce que le tribunal a affirm\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9cision :\nNous estimons que l'ordonnance de payer une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(3)b) de la Loi exige de faire la preuve des effets de la pratique discriminatoire sur les individus concern\u00e9s. Une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice morale est une indemnit\u00e9 personnelle qui est habituellement consentie dans le contexte d'une discrimination directe. Lors des audiences, un tribunal se prononcera sur l'adjudication d'une indemnit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage d'individus, t\u00e9moignage portant sur les effets qu'a eus sur lui ou sur elle la discrimination (voir R. v. Cranston (1997), T.D. 1\/97 (C.H.R.T.)). Ainsi, le Tribunal est en mesure d'observer le comportement du plaignant lors de son t\u00e9moignage et d'en tirer des conclusions, \u00e0 savoir, dans les circonstances, s'il est justifi\u00e9 ou non d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. \u00c0 notre avis, l'impact des d\u00e9lais qui a suscit\u00e9 des d\u00e9ceptions, des frustrations, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame de la tristesse ou de la col\u00e8re, m\u00eame s'il s'agit de r\u00e9actions l\u00e9gitimes, n'est pas \u00e0 la hauteur de la norme concernant le pr\u00e9judice moral et la perte de dignit\u00e9 que l'alin\u00e9a 53(3)b) s'emploie \u00e0 r\u00e9parer.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, la pratique discriminatoire tire son origine des attitudes et de l'histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu'ont en commun les hommes et les femmes. Les attitudes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la femme au travail \u00e9voluent gr\u00e2ce aux efforts de sensibilisation et d'\u00e9ducation, et aux lois. Il s'agit d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique, inh\u00e9rent au r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l'employeur. En se rendant \u00e0 la demande de la Commission et de l'Alliance, le Tribunal consentirait en masse des indemnit\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9judice moral, ce qu'il estime n'est pas l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'alin\u00e9a 53(3)b) de la Loi.\nNous ne doutons pas que certains plaignants ont ressenti un sentiment de perte, et que certains ont ressenti un sentiment de perte plus fort que d'autres. Nous convenons aussi qu'il n'est pas pratique que les individus concern\u00e9s par cette affaire viennent t\u00e9moigner devant le Tribunal quant aux effets qu'ils ont subis en raison de la pratique discriminatoire. Cependant, ces facteurs ne nous incitent pas \u00e0 consentir en masse des indemnit\u00e9s en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(3)b)242.\n[984] Le Tribunal souligne que dans l'extrait susmentionn\u00e9 de l'affaire Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Phase II), le tribunal examinait l'alin\u00e9a 53(3)b) de la version de la Loi qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la version amend\u00e9e de 1998. Cet alin\u00e9a \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n53(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de cinq mille dollars, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion, selon le cas :\na) que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9;\nb) que la victime a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[985] Le tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, traitait donc de l'argument de la Commission que, en cons\u00e9quence de la pratique discriminatoire, les victimes ont souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral (ancien alin\u00e9a 53(3)b)). Le tribunal en question ne traitait pas, dans ce contexte, de la question de savoir si une personne avait commis un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 (ancien alin\u00e9a 53(3)a)).\n[986] Par contre, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada a commis un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi actuelle. Il n'a fait aucune mention directe du pr\u00e9judice moral mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi actuelle.\n[987] L'utilisation par Postes Canada de la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Phase II) pour \u00e9tayer son rejet de la pr\u00e9tention de l'Alliance \u00e9tait donc, selon le Tribunal, quelque peu mal fond\u00e9e, car la d\u00e9cision du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor portait clairement sur la souffrance des victimes en rapport avec le pr\u00e9judice moral et non pas sur une personne qui a commis un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 .\n[988] Toutefois, en toute \u00e9quit\u00e9 pour Postes Canada, l'Alliance semble avoir examin\u00e9 les aspects de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) ainsi que ceux du paragraphe 53(3), quoiqu'elle a limit\u00e9 sa demande \u00e9crite au paragraphe 53(3)243. Par exemple, tout en all\u00e9guant que Postes Canada a commis un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, elle a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que ses victimes ont v\u00e9cu de grandes d\u00e9ceptions et de grandes frustrations et ont pu subir une blessure morale qui s'apparente au pr\u00e9judice moral dont il est fait mention \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e).\n[989] Compte tenu que l'Alliance a limit\u00e9 ses observations aux dispositions du paragraphe 53(3), le Tribunal concentre sa d\u00e9cision, sans la limiter, sur la dimension curative de l'article 53 de la Loi. Alors que l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada a contribu\u00e9 aux longs d\u00e9lais exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s dans le cadre de la plainte et a prolong\u00e9 le processus par ses critiques et ses arguments de nature technique et juridique, le Tribunal estime que l'on n'a pas fourni une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e suffisante pour que le Tribunal soit amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que Postes Canada a commis un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[990] L'acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 est, apr\u00e8s tout, un acte de discrimination syst\u00e9mique qui, comme concept, a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e involontaire. De m\u00eame, la Loi est une loi qui vise des mesures correctives plut\u00f4t qu'une loi qui vise \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer et \u00e0 punir.\n[991] Compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le Tribunal ne conclut pas que Postes Canada a vraisemblablement pratiqu\u00e9 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Le Tribunal ne conclut pas non plus qu'une preuve suffisante a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour documenter la mesure dans laquelle les victimes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, individuellement ou collectivement, ont pu subir un pr\u00e9judice moral, aussi difficile que cela puisse \u00eatre de le d\u00e9montrer lorsque l'on a affaire \u00e0 un grand nombre d'employ\u00e9s.\n[992] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut qu'aucune adjudication n'est justifi\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) ou en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi.\n(vi) Les frais juridiques [993] Selon l'Alliance, les frais juridiques, notamment les honoraires et les d\u00e9bours associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'adjudication de la plainte, laquelle a comport\u00e9 plus de 400 jours d'audience [Traduction] sont \u00e9normes . Afin de garantir une indemnisation compl\u00e8te des victimes, l'Alliance a estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel que les frais juridiques soient pris en compte. Selon l'Alliance, il est arriv\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 que l'avocat du plaignant ait apport\u00e9 une dimension importante \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation du dossier du plaignant, comme l'Alliance l'a fait en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[994] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il est admis que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques ainsi qu'une indemnit\u00e9 pour les autres d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es par la victime en cons\u00e9quence de l'acte discriminatoire. L'avocat de l'Alliance a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans Grover c. Conseil national de recherches du Canada [1992], D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 12 (QL). Dans cette d\u00e9cision le tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer les frais juridiques du plaignant selon le tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[995] L'Alliance a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites [1994], A.C.F. n\u00b0 364 (C.F.) (QL) et \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le tribunal dans Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel) [2001] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 43 (QL). Selon l'Alliance, ces deux d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient favorables \u00e0 l'inclusion de frais juridiques raisonnables dans l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un plaignant qui a gain de cause.\n[996] Par cons\u00e9quent l'Alliance a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne l'adjudication de ses frais juridiques. Elle propose que ces frais soient calcul\u00e9s selon une base indemnitaire cons\u00e9quente en conformit\u00e9 avec le tarif pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l'Ontario ainsi que dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile.\n[997] La Commission a pr\u00e9tendu que bien que dans le pass\u00e9 il y a pu y avoir un certain nombre d'incoh\u00e9rences dans les adjudications de frais juridiques, la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente confirme la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux dans ce domaine. La Commission a notamment renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Nkwazi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ainsi qu'\u00e0 Premakumar c. Air Canada, et s'est inspir\u00e9e du passage suivant tir\u00e9 ce cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision :\nJe suis d'avis que l'atteinte des objectifs visant l'indemnisation des victimes formul\u00e9s dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est davantage bien servie en veillant \u00e0 ce que les plaignants ayant gain de cause puissent obtenir le remboursement des frais juridiques raisonnables entra\u00een\u00e9s dans le cadre de l'instruction d'une plainte concernant une atteinte aux droits de la personne244.\n[998] Compte tenu que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue pendant 20 ans et que les frais juridiques et les d\u00e9bours li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce litige complexe auquel ont particip\u00e9 de nombreux t\u00e9moins experts et de nombreux t\u00e9moins profanes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9normes , la Commission s'est montr\u00e9e favorable \u00e0 une adjudication du plein montant des frais juridiques en faveur du groupe plaignant. La Commission a reconnu le [Traduction] r\u00f4le tr\u00e8s actif jou\u00e9 par l'Alliance dans la pr\u00e9sente, [Traduction] notamment dans le paiement de d\u00e9pens importants occasionn\u00e9s par le processus d'\u00e9valuation des emplois non fond\u00e9 sur le sexe entrepris par M. Wolf et ses coll\u00e8gues 245.\n[999] La Commission a conclu que ces facteurs militaient en faveur d'une adjudication \u00e0 l'Alliance du plein montant des frais juridiques.\n[1000] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que la pr\u00e9sente cause ne se pr\u00eatait pas \u00e0 une adjudication de frais juridiques. Alors que les proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 longues et complexes, Postes Canada a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Phase II) dans laquelle une adjudication de frais juridiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e inopportune.\n[1001] De fa\u00e7on ambigu\u00eb, Postes Canada dans ses observations de la fin, a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende la d\u00e9cision suivante :\n[Traduction]\nEn vertu d'une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale du paragraphe 53(1) de la Loi, que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes soit rembours\u00e9e par la CCDP et\/ou l'AFPC quant \u00e0 des frais juridiques raisonnables246.\n[1002] Le Tribunal fait remarquer que la pr\u00e9sente cause fut non seulement longue et complexe mais fut \u00e9galement plut\u00f4t tortueuse. Des all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites concernant le r\u00f4le possible qu'aurait jou\u00e9 Postes Canada dans cette tortuosit\u00e9, mais on peut \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendre que la Commission n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8tement libre de toute responsabilit\u00e9 que, elle a pu \u00e9galement contribuer \u00e0 cette tortuosit\u00e9 par la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle a g\u00e9r\u00e9 l'\u00e9tape de l'enqu\u00eate de la plainte. On peut \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendre que m\u00eame l'Alliance a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette tortuosit\u00e9 en ne voyant pas, lors de l'\u00e9tape de formation de la plainte, \u00e0 ce que les formes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration indirecte \u00e0 laquelle renvoie le paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi soient inclus dans les calculs de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[1003] Toutefois, tel qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la Loi ne vise pas \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer et ce n'est pas non plus ce que le Tribunal a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire. Une fois rendue dans l'ar\u00e8ne adjudicative du tribunal, chaque partie a choisi d'agir selon ses droits respectifs et a choisi et affin\u00e9 ses strat\u00e9gies en fonction de la plainte. Chaque partie a embauch\u00e9 son propre conseiller juridique et lui a donn\u00e9 les directives appropri\u00e9es.\n[1004] Compte tenu du caract\u00e8re involontaire de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination syst\u00e9mique en l'esp\u00e8ce et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement l'ensemble des arguments et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, le Tribunal conclut que chaque partie devrait assumer ses propres frais juridiques, y compris les d\u00e9bours connexes.\n(vii) R\u00e9tention de comp\u00e9tence [1005] L'Alliance et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal se d\u00e9clare comp\u00e9tent, pour traiter des questions qui, selon elles, pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es lors de l'ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Elles ont demand\u00e9 que ce soit en fonction de leurs besoins que le Tribunal se d\u00e9clare comp\u00e9tent.\n[1006] Dans le but d'aider l'ensemble des parties, selon les circonstances, le Tribunal acc\u00e8de \u00e0 cette demande.\nX. RESPONSABILIT\u00c9 CONJOINTE SYNDICAT-EMPLOYEUR QUANT \u00c0 LA DISCRIMINATION SALARIALE A. Les observations de Postes Canada [1007] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que, si le Tribunal devait conclure que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, l'Alliance, en tant que syndicat repr\u00e9sentant le groupe plaignant, et Postes Canada, en tant qu'employeur, devraient \u00eatre tenues conjointement responsables de la pratique discriminatoire.\n[1008] Le fondement de cette pr\u00e9tention de Postes Canada \u00e9tait son argument voulant que, en tant que principe, un syndicat et un employeur partagent la responsabilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 toute disposition, notamment une disposition discriminatoire, qui est n\u00e9goci\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une convention collective.\n[1009] \u00c0 l'appui de cette position, Postes Canada s'est fond\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9cisions Central Okanagan School District No 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 790, et Canada Safeway Ltd. c. Saskatchewan [1997] S.J. No.502 (Sask. C.A.).\nB. La position de l'Alliance [1010] L'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi interdit clairement l'imposition d'une responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 quiconque autre que l'employeur.\n[1011] De plus, l'Alliance a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9cision Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier et al. a force de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 11(1)247.\n[1012] L'Alliance a demand\u00e9 avec insistance au Tribunal de conclure que les causes cit\u00e9es par Postes Canada pourraient faire l'objet d'une distinction.\nC. La position de la Commission [1013] Les pr\u00e9tentions de la Commission ont soulign\u00e9 celles de l'Alliance.\nD. L'analyse du Tribunal [1014] La d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour d'appel dans Bell Canada, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par l'Alliance comme d\u00e9cision de principe quant \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi, comprend des affirmations cat\u00e9goriques voulant que l'article 11 de la Loi tient uniquement l'employeur responsable de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale relativement au travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Par exemple, au paragraphe 56 de cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nPour des motifs qui lui sont propres, le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi, \u00e0 l'article 11, de tenir uniquement l'employeur responsable des disparit\u00e9s salariales relativement au travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 part \u00e9gale des syndicats, soit implicitement en vertu de l'article 11, soit indirectement au moyen de dispositions comme l'article 10, pour avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la fixation de salaires diff\u00e9rents relativement \u00e0 un travail de valeur \u00e9gale irait carr\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'encontre du texte clair de la Loi et de l'intention \u00e9vidente du l\u00e9gislateur. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, un syndicat peut para\u00eetre servir ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats et agir contrairement \u00e0 l'\u00e9thique lorsqu'il utilise le m\u00e9canisme de plainte pr\u00e9vu par l'article 11 pour forcer, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, la r\u00e9vision de la convention collective qu'il a tout juste n\u00e9goci\u00e9e, mais, en l'absence de mauvaise foi--le juge des requ\u00eates n'a pas tir\u00e9 une conclusion particuli\u00e8re de mauvaise foi en l'esp\u00e8ce -- la loi ne l'interdit pas. La Cour applique la Loi telle qu'elle est, et non telle qu'elle aurait pu \u00eatre248.\n[1015] Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par l'une des cours ayant un pouvoir de contr\u00f4le sur le Tribunal. Elle comprenait la discussion susmentionn\u00e9e de la m\u00eame disposition qui est en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est-il tenu de suivre cette d\u00e9cision?\n[1016] La Cour a commenc\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 dans Bell Canada en stipulant qu'elle ne se pronon\u00e7ait pas sur une interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9finitive de l'article 11 de la Loi. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLe juge des requ\u00eates a commis une erreur en omettant totalement de tenir compte des articles 43, 44 et 49 de la Loi et en partant de la pr\u00e9misse que la principale question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce porte sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 11 (paragraphe 8 de ses motifs [\u00e0 la page 85]). Il ne s'agissait pas du tout de la question \u00e0 trancher \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape. La d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e est la demande de formation d'un tribunal des droits de la personne. Il incombera \u00e0 ce tribunal d'examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes, et le tribunal ne sera li\u00e9 d'aucune fa\u00e7on par l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'enqu\u00eateur a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 11 et que la Commission a vraisemblablement adopt\u00e9e. Ceux qui s'attendaient \u00e0 ce qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Cour se prononce sur des questions relatives \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation et \u00e0 l'application de l'article 11 sans avoir eu l'avantage de disposer de la d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard seront d\u00e9\u00e7us; tout ce que le juge des requ\u00eates a dit doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme des remarques incidentes, et je n'\u00e9mets aucun commentaire \u00e0 leur sujet249.\n[1017] Comme l'indiquent les propos de la Cour d'appel, la d\u00e9cision Bell Canada, laquelle fut invoqu\u00e9e par l'Alliance et la Commission dans leurs observations, avait fondamentalement trait \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander la formation d'un tribunal des droits de la personne en vertu de l'article 49 de la Loi.\n[1018] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe syndicat-employ\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 11 de la Loi demeure enti\u00e8re pour ce qui est de sa d\u00e9cision.\n[1019] Le paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi mentionne clairement sur qui repose la responsabilit\u00e9. La disposition de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale [...] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[1020] Ce libell\u00e9 peut \u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 celui des autres dispositions de la Loi, comme l'article 10, lequel traite explicitement des associations d'employ\u00e9s de m\u00eame que les employeurs, et comme l'article 7, lequel ne comprend aucun facteur limitatif.\n[1021] Si on se fonde \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation claire et directe du paragraphe 11(1), l'argument qu'un syndicat puisse encourir une responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Le renvoi par Postes Canada aux d\u00e9cisions Renaud et Safeway n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'aucune utilit\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, car ces d\u00e9cisions avaient toutes deux trait \u00e0 des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui traitaient de la responsabilit\u00e9 du syndicat et elles peuvent \u00eatre distingu\u00e9es pour ce motif. La cause en l'esp\u00e8ce ne traite pas de cela. En fait, l'article de la Loi est tr\u00e8s clair dans son libell\u00e9 qui mentionne que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale. Il n'y est fait mention d'aucun autre organisme et le libell\u00e9 ne manque pas de clart\u00e9.\n[1022] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne peut pas accepter la pr\u00e9tention de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe .\nXI.

Grant Sinclair, pr\u00e9sident Pierre Deschamps, membre\n[TRADUCTION]\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] La plaignante, CEP, a l'intention d'appeler comme t\u00e9moin M. Richard Shillington et de le qualifier de t\u00e9moin expert en statistique appliqu\u00e9e pour rendre un t\u00e9moignage dans la pr\u00e9sente audience. L'intim\u00e9e, Bell Canada, demande la production de certains rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par M. Shillington pour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux pages 14 et 15 de son curriculum vit\u00e6, qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s comme pi\u00e8ce CEP-34. Bell affirme qu'elle veut utiliser ces documents aux fins du contre-interrogatoire de M. Shillington \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses comp\u00e9tences en tant qu'expert.\n[2] Avec le consentement des parties, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u des photocopies de ces rapports afin qu'il les examine de fa\u00e7on confidentielle. Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal y renvoie en les nommant les pi\u00e8ces GNWT, CPC-1 et CPC-2.\nLA PI\u00c8CE GNWT\n[3] Cette pi\u00e8ce est constitu\u00e9e de trois rapports, deux dat\u00e9s du 28 mars 2001 et un dat\u00e9 du 19 mars 2001. La Commission pr\u00e9tend qu'il existe un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement relativement \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce GNWT. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette pi\u00e8ce parce que les rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour Ian Fine, l'avocat de la Commission, pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s et aux fins des n\u00e9gociations en vue d'un r\u00e8glement dans l'affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest. Dans son affidavit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, M. Fine affirme que la Commission s'est appuy\u00e9e sur ces rapports pour \u00e9tablir sa position au cours des n\u00e9gociations en vue d'un r\u00e8glement. Il affirme en outre que ces rapports confidentiels n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s ou utilis\u00e9s par la Commission autrement que dans le cours des discussions en vue d'un r\u00e8glement.\nABSENCE DE PRIVIL\u00c8GE POUR LA Commission\n[4] La Commission soutient qu'il existe un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige pour les pi\u00e8ces CPC-1 et CPC-2. La pi\u00e8ce CPC-1 comprend cinq rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en 1996-1997 par M. Shillington. La pi\u00e8ce CPC-2 est un rapport de six pages dat\u00e9 du 28 mai 1999 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par M. Shillington. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces deux pi\u00e8ces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es \u00e0 la demande de Fiona Keith, l'avocate de la Commission dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[5] La premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention de Bell est que la Commission ne peut pr\u00e9tendre en droit \u00e0 l'existence d'un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige ou d'un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement. Bell appuie sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. (TCDP), D\/367, D\/422-3.\n[6] La d\u00e9cision Dhanjal ne comporte aucune question se rapportant au privil\u00e8ge. Dans l'addenda \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a fait des commentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du comportement de l'avocat de la Commission, comportement que le Tribunal a d\u00e9crit comme excessivement accusatoire. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait d'avis que le r\u00f4le de l'avocat de la Commission ressemble au r\u00f4le de l'avocat de la Couronne dans une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle, comme M. le juge Sopinka l'a d\u00e9crit dans l'arr\u00eat R c. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 326. Ce r\u00f4le est celui du ministre de la Justice qui repr\u00e9sente l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (page 341).\n[7] L'arr\u00eat Stinchcombe a \u00e9tabli qu'il existe une obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour la Couronne de divulguer \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense les fruits de son enqu\u00eate. La justification de cette obligation est que les renseignements \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard font partie du domaine public et ne doivent pas servir seulement \u00e0 obtenir une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, mais qu'ils doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 s'assurer que justice soit rendue (page 333).\n[8] Suivant l'article 51 de la LCDP, l'avocat de la Commission a le r\u00f4le de repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Par analogie, Bell pr\u00e9tend que la Commission a la m\u00eame obligation que la Couronne, \u00e0 savoir l'obligation de divulguer tous les renseignements pertinents. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne peut pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 aucun privil\u00e8ge.\n[9] Selon le Tribunal, le fait que Bell s'appuie sur l'arr\u00eat Stinchcombe entra\u00eene une application erron\u00e9e des faits de l'arr\u00eat Stinchcombe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire et une interpr\u00e9tation incompl\u00e8te de Stinchcombe. Cet arr\u00eat traite d'une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle et \u00e9tablit un \u00e9quilibre entre la Couronne et la d\u00e9fense, comme l'exige l'article 7 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, et ce qui en r\u00e9sulte.\n[10] On retrouve une autre distinction entre une instance en mati\u00e8re criminelle et une instance devant le Tribunal dans les motifs du juge Sopinka lorsqu'il souligne qu'il n'existe pas une obligation pour la d\u00e9fense de divulguer quoi que ce soit \u00e0 la poursuite (page 333). Bell n'a jamais adopt\u00e9 la position que, en tant qu'intim\u00e9e lors de l'audience devant le Tribunal, elle n'a pas une obligation de divulgation.\n[11] Ce qui est encore plus important, c'est que l'arr\u00eat Stinchcombe n'affirme aucunement que la Couronne ne puisse jamais invoquer un privil\u00e8ge. Les motifs du juge Sopinka \u00e9noncent le contraire. Il \u00e9tablit tr\u00e8s clairement que la Couronne a une obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de divulguer les renseignements \u00e0 moins que la non-divulgation puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par le droit au privil\u00e8ge (page 340).\nABSENCE DE PRIVIL\u00c8GE RELATIF AU LITIGE QUANT AUX PI\u00c8CES CPC-1 OU CPC-2\n[12] Bell pr\u00e9tend ensuite que m\u00eame s'il existe un privil\u00e8ge, la Commission y a renonc\u00e9 pour les pi\u00e8ces CPC-1 et CPC-2. Bell s'appuie sur les faits ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. L'avocat de l'Alliance de la fonction publique dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Shillington de pr\u00e9parer pour lui une analyse. Selon les transcriptions de l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes fournies au Tribunal, l'AFPC consultait M. Shillington. Il aidait l'AFPC \u00e0 comprendre le rapport de M. Killingsworth et il l'aidait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du contre-interrogatoire de ce dernier, un statisticien expert appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par Postes Canada.\n[13] M. Shillington, pour effectuer l'analyse, avait besoin de certains renseignements qu'il a demand\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Killingsworth qui les lui a remis. Il a ensuite pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l'analyse qui consistait, selon les transcriptions, en cinq graphiques et en une feuille d'analyse Excel. Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, nous renvoyons \u00e0 ces cinq graphiques et \u00e0 cette feuille d'analyse Excel en les nommant le travail de juin 1999.\n[14] Lors du contre-interrogatoire, l'avocat de l'AFPC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Killingsworth s'il reconnaissait que les graphiques et la feuille d'analyse \u00e9taient exacts et si ces documents lui semblaient raisonnables. M. Killingsworth a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, alors l'avocat de l'AFPC lui a demand\u00e9 d'essayer de reproduire l'analyse de M. Shillington. M. Killingsworth a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait capable de faire des graphiques tr\u00e8s similaires, mais non identiques, en utilisant, selon ce qu'il a dit, les m\u00eames renseignements qu'il avait fournis \u00e0 M. Shillington.\n[15] Les graphiques et la feuille d'analyse pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par M. Shillington n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. L'avocat de Postes Canada s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'ils le soient. Les graphiques pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par M. Killingsworth ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve comme pi\u00e8ces 161, 162, 163, 164, etc., de l'AFPC.\n[16] Bell soutient qu'une pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle il existe un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du travail effectu\u00e9 par M. Shillington pour la Commission dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes n'est pas d\u00e9fendable. Dans ses observations, Bell pr\u00e9tend qu'il est de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique que l'ensemble ou une partie de son travail pour la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ces 161, 162 et 163 de l'AFPC par l'avocat de l'AFPC lors du contre-interrogatoire de M. Killingsworth. Bell affirme que la Commission doit par cons\u00e9quent avoir d\u00e9voil\u00e9 le travail de M. Shillington \u00e0 une autre partie, l'AFPC.\n[17] Bell pr\u00e9tend ensuite que, lors de l'examen de la question du privil\u00e8ge, l'ensemble du travail effectu\u00e9 par M. Shillington pour la Commission dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes se rapportant aux questions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de parit\u00e9 salariale doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme un tout. C'est-\u00e0-dire, il y a un lien qui est \u00e9tabli entre le travail de juin 1999 et les pi\u00e8ces CPC-1 et CPC-2 par le renvoi \u00e0 la question vis\u00e9e, \u00e0 celui qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le travail et \u00e0 la nature des questions.\n[18] La derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention de Bell est qu'il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que la Commission, puisqu'elle a renonc\u00e9 au privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du travail de juin 1999 effectu\u00e9 par M. Shillington, a renonc\u00e9 au privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'ensemble du travail qu'il a effectu\u00e9 pour la Commission dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes se rapportant \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[19] Le Tribunal n'accepte pas ces pr\u00e9tentions. Premi\u00e8rement, les transcriptions dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes montrent que les graphiques et la feuille d'analyse pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par M. Shillington n'\u00e9taient pas du travail effectu\u00e9 pour la Commission, mais qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande de l'avocat de l'AFPC.\n[20] Deuxi\u00e8mement, Bell a d\u00e9natur\u00e9 les faits. Il n'est pas exact que l'ensemble ou une partie du travail effectu\u00e9 par M. Shillington pour la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ces 161, 162, 163, etc., de l'AFPC. Les faits sont qu'aucune partie de son travail n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Les pi\u00e8ces 161, 162, 163, etc., de l'AFPC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par M. Killingsworth.\n[21] Troisi\u00e8mement, il est clair que l'avocat de l'AFPC n'avait pas l'intention de prot\u00e9ger le travail de M. Shillington d'un examen minutieux par l'autre partie lorsqu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce travail \u00e0 M. Killingsworth aux fins du contre-interrogatoire et il n'a pas fait de pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[22] Finalement, m\u00eame si on tient pour acquis que le travail de M. Shillington pour l'AFPC a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 pour la Commission et a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat de l'AFPC et rendu public, le Tribunal ne partage pas l'opinion qu'il existe un lien suffisant entre ce travail et les pi\u00e8ces CPC-1 et CPC-2. Bell, il faut convenir, n'a pas de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents jurisprudentiels pour appuyer sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle l'ensemble du travail de M. Shillington doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un tout. La pr\u00e9tention de Bell ne peut pas s'appuyer sur une simple affirmation, sans plus.\nABSENCE DE PRIVIL\u00c8GE \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DU R\u00c8GLEMENT - PI\u00c8CE GNWT\n[23] Quant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce GNWT, Bell conteste l'affirmation de la Commission portant sur le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement. Bell affirme que le r\u00e8glement est un document public; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement r\u00e9pandu dans le public, en particulier aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s actuels et des anciens employ\u00e9s au moyen d'une campagne d'information, et il y a des documents qui sont joints \u00e0 l'entente de r\u00e8glement qui traitent des questions techniques et statistiques, y compris de la m\u00e9thodologie et du fondement.\n[24] La politique sous-tendant le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement est qu'on devrait encourager des parties \u00e0 r\u00e9gler leurs litiges sans proc\u00e8s. Il s'ensuit alors que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, en encourageant le r\u00e8glement des litiges, exige que des documents cr\u00e9\u00e9s ou des communications faites aux fins des n\u00e9gociations de r\u00e8glement fassent l'objet d'un privil\u00e8ge. (Voir l'arr\u00eat Pirie c. Wyld, [1886] O.J. 188; Sopinka et al., Law of Evidence in Canada, (2e \u00e9d. 1999), aux paragraphes 14. 201 et 14. 213.)\n[25] Il est \u00e9galement bien \u00e9tabli en droit que le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement s'applique aux communications faites avec l'intention expresse ou implicite qu'elles ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9es et qu'il ne prend pas fin si les n\u00e9gociations en vue du r\u00e8glement \u00e9chouent ou si le r\u00e8glement est conclu. Le privil\u00e8ge s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 des instances subs\u00e9quentes qui n'ont pas de liens avec le litige ant\u00e9rieur. (Voir Sopinka et al., aux paragraphes 14.216 et 14.224; Middelkamp c. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, [1992] B.C.J. no 1947; 71 B.C.L.R. (2nd) 276 (C.A.C.B.).)\n[26] Le t\u00e9moignage d'Ian Fine est que les rapports de M. Shillington ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour apporter une aide dans les n\u00e9gociations en vue du r\u00e8glement. On n'a jamais eu l'intention qu'ils soient rendus publics ni qu'ils soient utilis\u00e9s ou divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins autres que celles d'un r\u00e8glement.\n[27] Le fait que le r\u00e8glement conclu entre les parties soit de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique signifie-t-il que tous les documents utilis\u00e9s lors des n\u00e9gociations qui ont conduit au r\u00e8glement perdent leur caract\u00e8re confidentiel? C'est ce que Bell pr\u00e9tend et, au soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention, Bell a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 deux affaires, \u00e0 savoir : Hill c. Gordon-Daly Grenadier Securities, (2001) 56 O.R. (3rd) 388, et Gay c. UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America, [2003] N.S.J. no 442.\n[28] Selon le Tribunal, aucune de ces affaires n'est utile \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de Bell. La d\u00e9cision Hill se rapportait \u00e0 une poursuite suivant la Loi sur les valeurs mobili\u00e8res de l'Ontario pour un abus de confiance. En vue d'une entente de r\u00e8glement entre la Commission des valeurs mobili\u00e8res de l'Ontario et les d\u00e9fendeurs, ces derniers ont fait certaines admissions dans l'entente de r\u00e8glement. Compte tenu de ces admissions, la CVMO a conclu que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'avaient pas agi de fa\u00e7on juste et honn\u00eate avec certains de leurs clients.\n[29] Ces clients ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un recours collectif contre les d\u00e9fendeurs et, au soutien de ce recours, ils voulaient s'appuyer sur les admissions des d\u00e9fendeurs contenus dans l'entente de r\u00e8glement. Les d\u00e9fendeurs invoquaient l'existence d'un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les documents de r\u00e8glement. La Cour divisionnaire de l'Ontario a statu\u00e9 que le privil\u00e8ge ne s'appliquait pas dans ces circonstances.\n[30] La Cour a soutenu que les directives de la CVMO pr\u00e9voyaient que toute entente de r\u00e8glement serait de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique. Les d\u00e9fendeurs ont conclu l'entente de r\u00e8glement en sachant parfaitement que tout ce qu'ils admettraient serait rendu public. Il serait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'ils avaient renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute pr\u00e9tention de confidentialit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 tout privil\u00e8ge.\n[31] Cette affaire est clairement diff\u00e9rente des faits dans l'affaire GTNO. Le r\u00e8glement dans l'affaire GTNO n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu suivant un texte l\u00e9gislatif. On ne peut pas conclure, comme on l'a fait dans la d\u00e9cision Hill, que toute attente \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la confidentialit\u00e9 ou d'un privil\u00e8ge tombe lorsque le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame, non les n\u00e9gociations ayant conduit au r\u00e8glement, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu public.\n[32] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gay, la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une action contre la d\u00e9fenderesse, UNUM Life Insurance Company, en r\u00e9clamant les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d'assurance contre les accidents. Cette action faisait suite \u00e0 une action qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre certains m\u00e9decins et un h\u00f4pital pour faute professionnelle. L'action pour faute professionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en m\u00e9diation. Le contrat de m\u00e9diation contenait une clause de confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyant que toutes les communications entre les parties faisaient l'objet d'un privil\u00e8ge et \u00e9taient faites sous r\u00e9serve de tous les droits.\n[33] Aux fins de la m\u00e9diation, les m\u00e9decins d\u00e9fendeurs avaient divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante des rapports se rapportant \u00e0 la question de leur responsabilit\u00e9 professionnelle qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par leurs experts. La compagnie d'assurance d\u00e9fenderesse demandait la production des rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les experts. La Cour en a ordonn\u00e9 la production en soutenant qu'une fois que les rapports des experts \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante, la confidentialit\u00e9 tombait qu'il soit ou non pr\u00e9vu une r\u00e9serve de tous les droits.\n[34] Selon le Tribunal, les faits dans l'affaire GTNO sont si diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la d\u00e9cision Gay qu'ils rendent non applicable la conclusion de la d\u00e9cision Gay.\n[35] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Bell est rejet\u00e9e.\nJ.

CONCLUSION\n[1] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu'il a fait l'objet de discrimination en raison de sa couleur durant sa formation pratique \u00e0 titre de membre de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC), et que cette discrimination a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la cessation subs\u00e9quente de son emploi, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'art. 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En outre, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9 par la GRC \u00e0 cause de sa couleur au cours de sa formation, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'art. 14 de la Loi.\n[2] Le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par avocat au cours de l'instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal. L'avocat de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a vers\u00e9 au dossier un expos\u00e9 initial le premier jour de l'audience et n'a ni assist\u00e9 ni particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience par la suite. L'audience proprement dite a dur\u00e9 51 jours et s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Vancouver et Ottawa. Trente-neuf t\u00e9moins ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[3] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessous, j'ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la couleur du plaignant n'a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le ni dans la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 alors qu'il \u00e9tait au service de la GRC, ni dans son cong\u00e9diement subs\u00e9quent. Le plaignant a trouv\u00e9 sa formation tr\u00e8s stressante. Cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode agr\u00e9able de sa vie. Bien que l'employeur ait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s exigeant \u00e0 son endroit durant sa formation, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 qu'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa couleur ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la mani\u00e8re dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9. J'ai \u00e9galement conclu qu'il n'a pas fait pas l'objet de harc\u00e8lement en raison de sa couleur.\nI. FAITS A. Entr\u00e9e au service de la GRC [4] Le plaignant est un Montr\u00e9alais de race noire. En 1994, il s'est inscrit \u00e0 un programme sp\u00e9cial administr\u00e9 par la GRC visant \u00e0 enseigner \u00e0 des Ha\u00eftiens et des Canadiens les techniques polici\u00e8res \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de la GRC \u00e0 Regina (commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t). \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Ha\u00efti \u00e9tait dans une p\u00e9riode transitoire sur le plan politique. Le programme visait \u00e0 aider le pays \u00e0 se doter d'un corps de police constitu\u00e9 d'agents nouvellement form\u00e9s. Les dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s du programme pr\u00e9voyaient joindre les rangs du corps de police ha\u00eftien. Le plaignant a termin\u00e9 le programme avec succ\u00e8s mais, pour des motifs ayant trait \u00e0 sa double citoyennet\u00e9 (canadienne et ha\u00eftienne), il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'accompagner les autres recrues \u00e0 Ha\u00efti. Apr\u00e8s sa formation \u00e0 Regina, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour terminer ses \u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales. Comme il avait alors d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat profond pour l'activit\u00e9 polici\u00e8re, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en toute bonne foi une demande d'inscription au programme de formation des recrues de la GRC \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t, peu apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales. Apr\u00e8s avoir subi les nombreux examens d'entr\u00e9e administr\u00e9s par la GRC, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis au programme en avril 1996.\n[5] Ayant choisi d'entreprendre sa formation le plus t\u00f4t possible, le plaignant n'a eu d'autre choix que de suivre celle-ci en anglais. La formation en fran\u00e7ais devait d\u00e9buter quelques mois plus tard. La langue maternelle du plaignant est le fran\u00e7ais, mais il avait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque une certaine connaissance de l'anglais. Durant son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le plaignant a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aide d'ouvrages bilingues, tant et si bien que sa connaissance de l'anglais s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9e au fil du temps. Sa formation a dur\u00e9 six mois et il a obtenu son dipl\u00f4me en octobre 1996.\nB. Formation pratique - Premier et deuxi\u00e8me mois [6] Apr\u00e8s sa formation \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 comme policier aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux au d\u00e9tachement de la GRC \u00e0 Burnaby, en Colombie-Britannique, afin d'y suivre sa formation pratique. Ce stage de formation professionnelle des recrues est administr\u00e9 en vertu du programme de formation pratique, d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e9galement sous le nom de formation pratique des recrues (FPR). Ce programme est d'une dur\u00e9e de six mois. La recrue est membre de la GRC pendant cette p\u00e9riode, mais elle peut \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e si elle ne r\u00e9ussit pas le programme de formation pratique. Durant sa FPR, un membre r\u00e9gulier de la GRC est jumel\u00e9 \u00e0 la recrue \u00e0 titre de formateur ou de mentor. Le formateur fait \u00e9quipe avec la recrue dans la voiture de patrouille pendant la majeure partie de la p\u00e9riode de formation et \u00e9value ponctuellement le rendement du nouveau membre. Un rapport d'\u00e9valuation est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 tous les deux mois. Au moment o\u00f9 le dernier rapport est \u00e9tabli apr\u00e8s six mois, la recrue doit satisfaire \u00e0 toutes les exigences pour r\u00e9ussir sa FPR.\n[7] Burnaby est, bien s\u00fbr, une vaste municipalit\u00e9 faisant partie du Grand Vancouver. Le gouvernement du Canada et la ville de Burnaby ont conclu une entente en vertu de laquelle la GRC assure \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re des services de police. Le d\u00e9tachement de la GRC \u00e0 Burnaby est le deuxi\u00e8me en importance au pays. Le plaignant ne s'\u00e9tait jamais rendu \u00e0 Burnaby auparavant et savait peu de choses au sujet de cette ville. Il est arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0-bas le ou vers le 15 novembre 1996, deux semaines apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me de la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport par son formateur attitr\u00e9, le gendarme (gend.) John Haney.\n[8] La premi\u00e8re rencontre du plaignant avec son formateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 amicale. Le gend. Haney a invit\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 habiter chez lui jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il se trouve un logement. Le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de travail le lendemain de son arriv\u00e9e. Le gend. Haney l'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux autres employ\u00e9s de la GRC. Il s'est mis en frais d'aider le stagiaire \u00e0 se trouver un appartement et une succursale bancaire bien situ\u00e9e o\u00f9 il pourrait ouvrir un compte. Malgr\u00e9 ce d\u00e9but relativement amical de leur relation de travail, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le gend. Haney a commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s quelques jours \u00e0 faire montre d'une attitude discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit.\n[9] D\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Burnaby, le plaignant a voulu s'acheter une voiture. Il jetait un coup d'il aux annonces class\u00e9es dans le journal. Beaucoup d'annonces renfermaient la mention OBO (or best offer; ou la meilleure offre), qui faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au prix demand\u00e9. L'anglais \u00e9tant sa langue seconde, le plaignant ne savait pas ce que signifiait cette abr\u00e9viation. Il croyait \u00e0 tort qu'il s'agissait du nom d'un r\u00e9sident de la ville qui avait beaucoup de voitures \u00e0 vendre. Alors qu'il \u00e9tait dans la voiture de patrouille avec le gend. Haney, le plaignant a dit qu'il songeait \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 OBO en vue d'acheter une de ses voitures. En entendant cela, le gend. Haney a pouff\u00e9 de rire. Le plaignant ne savait pas pourquoi. Plus tard, ils se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s dans un restaurant-minute pour prendre le petit d\u00e9jeuner en compagnie d'autres membres de la GRC de leur d\u00e9tachement. Le gend. Haney a racont\u00e9 aux autres ce que le plaignant lui avait dit et tout le monde s'est esclaff\u00e9. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que le plaignant a appris ce que signifiait l'abr\u00e9viation OBO et pourquoi les autres riaient.\n[10] \u00c0 compter de ce jour-l\u00e0, le gend. Haney et d'autres membres de la GRC ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 surnommer le plaignant OBO. Le plaignant admet qu'il a tol\u00e9r\u00e9 pendant trois ou quatre jours de se faire appeler ainsi et qu'en fait, il esquissait m\u00eame un large sourire lorsqu'on racontait l'histoire concernant les annonces class\u00e9es. Cependant, l'emploi du surnom a persist\u00e9 pendant plusieurs mois. Des personnes qu'il connaissait \u00e0 peine utilisaient ce surnom. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il se sentait comme un bouffon lorsqu'on s'adressait \u00e0 lui de cette fa\u00e7on. En outre, le surnom comporte \u00e0 son avis des connotations raciales. Il soutient que l'expression or best offer \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e durant les ventes aux ench\u00e8res d'esclaves dans l'Am\u00e9rique d'avant la guerre civile, ce qu'il trouvait particuli\u00e8rement offensant.\n[11] Le gend. Haney se souvenait de la discussion qui a eu lieu dans la voiture de patrouille au sujet des annonces class\u00e9es. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant et lui-m\u00eame ont ri de l'erreur. Toutefois, il a soulign\u00e9 que sa r\u00e9action ne comportait pas de connotation raciale. Il a simplement employ\u00e9 le terme OBO par la suite comme surnom dr\u00f4le et comme marque d'affiliation au reste de l'\u00e9quipe. Selon le gend. Haney, de nombreux membres du d\u00e9tachement, dont lui-m\u00eame, avaient des surnoms. L'emploi de surnoms \u00e9tait typique de la camaraderie qui existait entre eux et qui n'\u00e9tait pas sans rappeler les rapports qu'entretiennent entre eux les joueurs d'une \u00e9quipe sportive. Il nie fermement que le plaignant lui ait jamais indiqu\u00e9 express\u00e9ment ou implicitement qu'il \u00e9tait offens\u00e9 ou que l'utilisation du surnom lui d\u00e9plaisait. Le plaignant riait ou n'avait aucune r\u00e9action lorsqu'on l'interpellait de cette fa\u00e7on. Le gend. Haney a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une vid\u00e9o amateur que sa conjointe a tourn\u00e9e lors d'un party qui a eu lieu chez ce dernier le 30 novembre 1996, deux semaines apr\u00e8s que le plaignant eut commenc\u00e9 sa FPR. On peut voir sur cette vid\u00e9o une douzaine d'invit\u00e9s, dont le plaignant. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, la conjointe du gend. Haney qui tenait le cam\u00e9scope s'adresse au plaignant en disant All\u00f4, OBO. On voit alors le plaignant esquisser un sourire et r\u00e9agir de fa\u00e7on aimable.\n[12] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu'un autre incident au cours duquel le gend. Haney a fait montre d'une attitude discriminatoire s'est produit dans les d\u00e9buts de sa FPR. Avant une s\u00e9ance de breffage au d\u00e9tachement, le gend. Haney a vu le plaignant en train de saluer le gend. Ader Albert, qui est lui aussi de race noire et d'origine ha\u00eftienne. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le gend. Haney a esquiss\u00e9 un geste de la main et pass\u00e9 la remarque suivante : [TRADUCTION] Est-ce la fa\u00e7on dont vous, les Noirs, vous serrez la main? \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait eu l'impression en entendant cette remarque qu'on se moquait de lui. Le gend. Albert a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait souvenance de cette sc\u00e8ne, mais qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas senti offusqu\u00e9. Il ne se rappelle pas que le plaignant ait alors manifest\u00e9 des signes de d\u00e9sapprobation. Selon le gend. Albert, le gend. Haney voulait simplement faire une farce. Le gend. Haney n'a aucun souvenir de l'incident.\n[13] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'au cours des deux premiers mois de sa formation, le gend. Haney a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 critiquer vivement son rendement et que les relations entre eux ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer. Le formateur trouvait \u00e0 redire sur une bonne partie des choses que faisait le plaignant. Le temps de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un appel est devenu un sujet de discorde. Le gend. Haney estimait que le plaignant mettait trop de temps \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 un endroit. Parfois, il s'\u00e9garait. Le plaignant fait remarquer qu'il venait d'arriver \u00e0 Burnaby et qu'il ne connaissait pas encore la ville. C'est la raison pour laquelle il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de louer un appartement \u00e0 Burnaby. Il voulait rester dans cette ville m\u00eame lorsqu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en service afin de se familiariser avec l'endroit. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le gend. Haney faisait montre d'impatience \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mesurer \u00e0 l'aide de sa montre le temps qu'il lui fallait pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel. Il appert que le gend. Haney devenait parfois tellement enrag\u00e9 par la fa\u00e7on d'agir du plaignant qu'il criait apr\u00e8s lui et frappait sur la voiture avec ses mains. Une fois, le plaignant a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 au gend. Haney qu'ils \u00e9taient tous deux des adultes et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de crier.\n[14] Au dire du plaignant, le fait que le gend. Haney le chronom\u00e9trait constamment lui causait un \u00e9norme stress et l'amenait parfois \u00e0 faire des erreurs. Il se sentait harcel\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de cette pratique. Ses coll\u00e8gues recrues n'\u00e9taient pas soumis \u00e0 ce r\u00e9gime; en fait, presque aucun des membres de la GRC qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce a dit se souvenir d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re au cours de sa formation pratique, bien que plusieurs aient admis s'\u00eatre fait dire durant leur FPR qu'ils mettaient trop de temps pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel ou ex\u00e9cuter leurs autres fonctions.\n[15] Le gend. Haney reconna\u00eet que le plaignant a manifest\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement face au stress que lui imposait le fait qu'on mettait en doute ses comp\u00e9tences au volant en le chronom\u00e9trant. Cependant, le formateur soutient que cet outil se voulait un moyen de corriger un d\u00e9faut chez le plaignant. Il est important qu'un policier puisse r\u00e9agir \u00e0 un appel rapidement et de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire. Au d\u00e9but, les temps de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant \u00e9taient m\u00e9diocres et il avait du mal \u00e0 s'orienter dans la ville. Le chronom\u00e9trage s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 un moyen efficace malgr\u00e9 les protestations du plaignant. En l'espace d'un mois, les temps de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant se sont am\u00e9lior\u00e9s et ont atteint un niveau acceptable. Le gend. Haney reconna\u00eet qu'aucune des autres recrues confi\u00e9es \u00e0 des coll\u00e8gues \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on. Il affirme n\u00e9anmoins que cet outil auquel il avait song\u00e9 dans le cas du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile, voire ing\u00e9nieux, et qu'il pourrait se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile \u00e9galement pour d'autres stagiaires. Il ne se souvient d'aucun incident particulier au cours duquel il aurait \u00e9lev\u00e9 la voix ou frapp\u00e9 sur la voiture avec ses mains pour manifester son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 ce sujet, comme le pr\u00e9tend le plaignant. Le gend. Haney ne nie pas que ses critiques constructives \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant aient pu \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es par le plaignant comme des vocif\u00e9rations.\n[16] Le gend. Haney ne se contentait pas de chronom\u00e9trer le plaignant lorsque celui-ci r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 un appel. Il prenait note du temps qu'il fallait \u00e0 son stagiaire pour r\u00e9diger un rapport de police. Le gend. Haney pr\u00e9tendait que le plaignant prenait trop de temps pour r\u00e9diger ses rapports et que la qualit\u00e9 de ceux-ci \u00e9tait m\u00e9diocre, tant pour ce qui est du fond que de la forme (syntaxe et orthographe). Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consigner le temps que le plaignant mettait \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter cette t\u00e2che, toujours dans le but d'am\u00e9liorer son rendement. Le gend. Haney pr\u00e9tend avoir eu moins de succ\u00e8s avec cette m\u00e9thode qu'avec le moyen mis au point pour r\u00e9duire le temps de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant \u00e0 un appel.\n[17] Au dire du plaignant, le fait qu'on prenait note du temps qu'il lui fallait pour r\u00e9diger ses rapports lui causait un stress suppl\u00e9mentaire et nuisait \u00e0 son rendement. En outre, il signale que, contrairement aux autres recrues, il n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger ses rapports \u00e0 l'aide des ordinateurs qui se trouvaient au d\u00e9tachement ou dans la voiture de patrouille. S'il avait pu le faire, il aurait apport\u00e9 directement \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran les changements n\u00e9cessaires, notamment au moyen du correcteur orthographique, avant d'imprimer ses textes. Le gend. Haney lui avait cependant demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9diger ses rapports manuellement. Souvent, il lui demandait de recommencer lorsqu'il manquait quelque chose. Il devait parfois s'y reprendre \u00e0 plusieurs fois, ce qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, exigeait qu'il consacre encore plus de temps \u00e0 ses rapports. Le gend. Haney critiquait \u00e9galement l'\u00e9criture du plaignant, insistant pour qu'il \u00e9crive en lettres moul\u00e9es plut\u00f4t qu'en cursive lorsqu'il remplissait des formules ou r\u00e9digeait des rapports, et m\u00eame lorsqu'il consignait des renseignements dans son carnet. Le plaignant soutient qu'il avait une \u00e9criture soign\u00e9e et que ces commentaires \u00e9taient injustifi\u00e9s. Il estime que le gend. Haney s'acharnait sur lui et qu'il \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres recrues. Le gend. Haney \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait important d'apprendre \u00e0 r\u00e9diger un rapport manuellement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'un policier ne dispose pas toujours d'un ordinateur. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement indispensable, selon lui, que le plaignant soigne son \u00e9criture. Le policier qui avait form\u00e9 le gend. Haney durant sa FPR avait toujours insist\u00e9 sur ces points. Le gend. Haney voulait faire profiter le plaignant des bienfaits de cette formation.\n[18] Le gend. Haney avait \u00e9galement recours \u00e0 un autre outil : le journal quotidien d'entra\u00eenement. \u00c0 compter de la mi-d\u00e9cembre 1996, le gend. Haney s'est mis \u00e0 consigner les activit\u00e9s accomplies par le plaignant durant chaque quart de travail. \u00c0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e, le plaignant devait lire le journal quotidien d'entra\u00eenement et r\u00e9diger une auto-\u00e9valuation de rendement fond\u00e9e sur une \u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 3 (m\u00e9diocre \u00e0 excellent). Son formateur \u00e9tablissait ensuite sa propre \u00e9valuation en se fondant sur la m\u00eame \u00e9chelle, apr\u00e8s quoi le plaignant et lui expliquaient comment ils en \u00e9taient venus \u00e0 leurs conclusions respectives. Le gend. Haney consignait des suggestions quant aux points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer. La plupart du temps, ils en arrivaient tous les deux \u00e0 un score identique - habituellement 2. Ce syst\u00e8me de notation a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pendant un peu plus d'un mois, jusqu'\u00e0 la mi-janvier 1997. Cependant, le gend. Haney et certains membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation du plaignant ont continu\u00e9 par la suite de r\u00e9diger dans le journal d'entra\u00eenement des \u00e9valuations sommaires de rendement, jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode initiale de FPR. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. Haney a dit avoir eu recours au journal d'entra\u00eenement pour cerner et faire comprendre au plaignant les points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer.\n[19] L'utilisation du journal d'entra\u00eenement aga\u00e7ait le plaignant. Le gend. Haney aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 employer cet outil aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s le pr\u00e9tendu exc\u00e8s de col\u00e8re qu'il aurait eu dans la voiture de patrouille et qui aurait suscit\u00e9 la r\u00e9probation du plaignant. Le plaignant estime que son formateur a eu recours au journal d'entra\u00eenement en guise de repr\u00e9sailles envers lui.\n[20] Lors du party de No\u00ebl du d\u00e9tachement, le plaignant a eu l'occasion de s'entretenir avec son superviseur, le caporal (cap.) Peter Fischer, \u00e0 qui il s'est plaint de la m\u00e9thode difficile du gend. Haney et du fait qu'il hurlait apr\u00e8s lui. Le cap. Fischer a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la plainte. Il a consult\u00e9 son propre superviseur, le sergent (serg.) Dwight Watts, puis a rencontr\u00e9 le gend. Haney afin d'entendre sa version des faits. Le formateur lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00e9cel\u00e9 des lacunes chez le plaignant. Il a soutenu qu'il travaillait \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ces probl\u00e8mes et qu'il s'effor\u00e7ait de le faire sans \u00eatre trop s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu ces explications, et eu \u00e9gard au fait que le plaignant n'avait pas demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9signation d'un nouveau formateur, le cap. Fischer a enjoint le plaignant de se conformer aux instructions du gend. Haney.\n[21] Au d\u00e9but de janvier 1997, \u00e0 l'occasion d'une autre conversation, le serg. Watts a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il voulait \u00eatre jumel\u00e9 \u00e0 un nouveau formateur pendant le reste de sa formation pratique. Le plaignant a rejet\u00e9 l'offre. Il a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les choses allaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 tellement mal pour lui, il ne voulait pas envenimer la situation en donnant l'impression de se d\u00e9rober devant une situation difficile. Deux autres t\u00e9moins, le gend. Maxime St-Fleur et le gend. Oakland Knight, ont affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'ils avaient demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9signation de nouveaux formateurs durant leur FPR au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Fait int\u00e9ressant, ces deux recrues \u00e9taient elles aussi de race noire. Le gend. St-Fleur \u00e9tait un francophone d'origine ha\u00eftienne qui, \u00e0 l'instar du plaignant, venait du Qu\u00e9bec. Les recrues en question n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi leur FPR apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode initiale de six mois, et ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s que leur FPR eut \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e de plusieurs mois qu'elles sont parvenues \u00e0 le faire. Aujourd'hui, ces personnes sont toutes les deux des membres r\u00e9guliers actifs de la GRC.\n[22] Le 20 janvier 1997, le gend. Haney a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 apr\u00e8s deux mois le rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement du plaignant, conform\u00e9ment au programme de formation pratique. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'attendait \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation relativement positive, compte tenu des r\u00e9sultats figurant dans le journal d'entra\u00eenement, o\u00f9 on lui avait attribu\u00e9 la plupart du temps la note moyenne de 2. Le rapport d'\u00e9valuation renfermait une grille \u00e9num\u00e9rant 28 crit\u00e8res en fonction desquels devait \u00eatre cot\u00e9 le rendement de la recrue. Les diverses cotes possibles \u00e9taient les suivantes : sup\u00e9rieur, comp\u00e9tent ou \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer. Ce fut pour le plaignant un choc d'apprendre que le gend. Haney avait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait des points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer relativement \u00e0 dix des crit\u00e8res. Les lacunes mentionn\u00e9es avaient trait \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir un probl\u00e8me, aux communications \u00e9crites, \u00e0 la connaissance et \u00e0 l'application du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures, \u00e0 l'aptitude \u00e0 recueillir des renseignements et \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de mener une enqu\u00eate et de recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ses comp\u00e9tences au volant et en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du policier, ainsi que son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions, laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[23] La formule de rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement renfermait une section r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux commentaires de la recrue. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il souscrivait aux observations du gend. Haney et qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sireux d'am\u00e9liorer sa grammaire anglaise. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il appr\u00e9ciait la formation dispens\u00e9e par son formateur jusqu'alors et qu'il allait faire de son mieux pour am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences.\n[24] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas du tout d'accord, en fait, avec l'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9tablie par le gend. Haney, faisant remarquer qu'on n'avait relev\u00e9 aucune des lacunes en question au moment o\u00f9 il a obtenu son dipl\u00f4me de la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t. Cependant, plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont indiqu\u00e9 que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus \u00e0 l'entra\u00eenement \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t ne laissent pas n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9sager que la recrue aura autant de succ\u00e8s durant sa formation pratique dans le monde r\u00e9el. Le gend. Haney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en tout \u00e9tat de cause, le fait de trouver qu'un stagiaire avait des points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer impliquait simplement que la recrue devait faire des progr\u00e8s en vue d'atteindre la norme. Il a fait remarquer qu'un grand nombre des lacunes du plaignant \u00e9taient interreli\u00e9es. Il avait constat\u00e9, par exemple, que le plaignant avait une pi\u00e8tre connaissance des lois et r\u00e8glements provinciaux et municipaux que les policiers du d\u00e9tachement de la GRC \u00e0 Burnaby \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s de faire respecter. \u00c0 cause de ces lacunes, le plaignant prenait des d\u00e9cisions mal avis\u00e9es dans divers domaines, notamment lorsqu'il s'agissait de mener une enqu\u00eate sur les lieux d'un crime ou de recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Le gend. Haney a fait observer qu'il y avait \u00e9galement des mots d'encouragement dans le rapport d'\u00e9valuation. Il y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait une personne intelligente qui avait la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussir. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 dans le rapport que certaines difficult\u00e9s r\u00e9dactionnelles du plaignant \u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre imputables au fait que l'anglais \u00e9tait sa langue seconde.\n[25] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement vex\u00e9 du fait que le rapport ne fasse aucunement \u00e9tat des bons coups ou des exploits qu'il avait r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au cours des deux premiers mois de sa formation. Un incident hors de l'ordinaire \u00e9tait survenu dans un restaurant local o\u00f9 le plaignant et le gend. Haney prenaient leur d\u00eener le 27 novembre 1996. Le plaignant a remarqu\u00e9 qu'un client qui venait de prendre une bouch\u00e9e de nourriture \u00e9tait en train de s'\u00e9touffer et avait peine \u00e0 respirer. Le plaignant est aussit\u00f4t intervenu, ex\u00e9cutant la manuvre de Heimlich pour expulser les aliments, tandis que le gend. Haney demandait par radio qu'on d\u00e9p\u00eache des ambulanciers sur les lieux. Les efforts du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9s de succ\u00e8s et ont permis de sauver la vie du client. \u00c0 la suite de l'incident, le gend. Haney s'est content\u00e9 de passer le commentaire suivant au moment o\u00f9 ils se sont rassis \u00e0 leur table pour terminer leur repas : [TRADUCTION] Beau travail, en passant.\n[26] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'apr\u00e8s le retour au poste, le gend. Haney n'a fait aucun effort particulier pour informer des sup\u00e9rieurs de son exploit ou pour signaler celui-ci de fa\u00e7on officielle \u00e0 d'autres membres du d\u00e9tachement. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 que le plaignant et lui avaient racont\u00e9 l'incident \u00e0 leurs coll\u00e8gues et superviseurs apr\u00e8s \u00eatre retourn\u00e9s au poste. Toutefois, les gend. Haney n'a pas jug\u00e9 opportun de r\u00e9diger et de diffuser une note concernant leur propre exploit. Cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme de l'auto-promotion. Il valait mieux laisser \u00e0 leurs superviseurs le soin de souligner l'exploit. En fait, plusieurs jours plus tard, apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9tachement eut re\u00e7u du client du restaurant une lettre remerciant le plaignant et le gend. Haney de lui avoir sauv\u00e9 la vie, le surint. R.W. Fenske, qui \u00e9tait l'officier responsable du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note de service les f\u00e9licitant pour leur conduite. Une copie de la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e au dossier personnel du plaignant. Cependant, le gend. Haney n'a pas, pour sa part, fait \u00e9tat de la prouesse du plaignant dans le rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement qu'il a \u00e9tabli apr\u00e8s les deux premiers mois.\n[27] Fait int\u00e9ressant, le superviseur du gend. Haney n'a pas manqu\u00e9 quelques mois plus tard de signaler l'exploit en termes \u00e9logieux dans l'\u00e9valuation annuelle de rendement de ce dernier. Le cap. Fischer a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que l'\u00e9valuation annuelle de rendement et l'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9tablis au cours d'une FPR sont deux choses diff\u00e9rentes. L'\u00e9valuation annuelle de rendement a pour objet de signaler toutes les r\u00e9alisations attest\u00e9es - positives ou n\u00e9gatives - d'un policier. Si le plaignant avait r\u00e9ussi sa FPR, sa propre \u00e9valuation annuelle de rendement aurait fait mention de l'exploit. En revanche, le rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement ne vise qu'\u00e0 indiquer si la recrue a atteint le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis par rapport \u00e0 chacun des 28 crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la norme de formation pratique.\nC. Formation pratique - Troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me mois [28] Au cours des deux mois qui ont suivi, le gend. Haney a constat\u00e9 des progr\u00e8s chez le plaignant; toutefois, il a continu\u00e9 de d\u00e9plorer ses lacunes dans certains domaines. Le formateur \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la qualit\u00e9 des notes et des rapports de son stagiaire. Le gend. Haney lui avait conseill\u00e9 d'imiter sa fa\u00e7on formel de prendre des notes. Il semble que le plaignant n'ait pas pris mod\u00e8le sur le style de son formateur; cependant, d'autres membres de la GRC ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, d'habitude, un agent est libre d'adopter la m\u00e9thode de prise de notes qu'il lui convient, pourvu que celles-ci soient suffisamment claires et puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es lors d'une audience en cour. Le gend. Haney a fait remarquer que, peu importe la m\u00e9thode de prise de notes utilis\u00e9e, certains faits doivent absolument \u00eatre signal\u00e9s, ce que le plaignant n'arrivait pas \u00e0 faire apr\u00e8s presque quatre mois de formation.\n[29] En ce qui concerne l'\u00e9tablissement des rapports, le gend. Haney trouvait encore que le plaignant avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 consigner les renseignements pertinents et que les travaux de r\u00e9daction prenaient trop de temps. Cependant, le gend. Haney avait bon espoir que le plaignant pourrait s'am\u00e9liorer. Dans au moins un cas o\u00f9 il avait ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de recommencer son rapport, le r\u00e9sultat final \u00e9tait beaucoup mieux. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 plusieurs fois dans le journal d'entra\u00eenement que le plaignant pourrait r\u00e9ussir en s'appliquant davantage. Il est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le journal d'entra\u00eenement que le plaignant rechignait de plus en plus, chaque fois qu'on lui ordonnait de recommencer son travail.\n[30] Le gend. Haney a \u00e9galement fait \u00e9tat des difficult\u00e9s du plaignant \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions sur le terrain. \u00c0 son avis, le plaignant devait am\u00e9liorer sa connaissance de base du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures pour faire des progr\u00e8s sur ce plan. En outre, le gend. Haney encourageait le plaignant \u00e0 poser des questions et \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 profit l'exp\u00e9rience des autres lorsqu'il devait prendre des d\u00e9cisions.\n[31] Pour sa part, le plaignant contestait ces opinions et reprochait au gend. Haney de ne pas s'\u00eatre acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de lui dispenser une formation ad\u00e9quate. Selon la norme de formation du programme de formation pratique, la GRC s'attendait \u00e0 ce que le formateur fasse montre de respect dans ses rapports avec son stagiaire et \u00e9tablisse avec lui une bonne relation de travail. La recrue est cens\u00e9e se sentir \u00e0 l'aise avec son formateur. Ce dernier devait \u00e0 son tour pr\u00eacher par l'exemple. Ce genre de relation n'a jamais exist\u00e9 entre le plaignant et le gend. Haney. Le plaignant \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement mal \u00e0 l'aise, \u00e0 cause des critiques r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de son formateur. Il se rendait chaque jour au travail en se demandant \u00e0 quoi ce dernier trouverait \u00e0 redire.\n[32] Si ses comp\u00e9tences laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, c'\u00e9tait parce que son formateur ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 suffisamment de r\u00e9troaction au sujet de ce qu'il devait faire pour s'am\u00e9liorer. Le plaignant a d\u00fb prendre en main son propre perfectionnement. Il a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de sinscrire \u00e0 un cours de perfectionnement linguistique en anglais. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les lois et r\u00e8glements en vigueur, et il a visionn\u00e9 de nombreuses vid\u00e9ocassettes de formation dans ses temps libres, habituellement au d\u00e9tachement. Il restait souvent au bureau apr\u00e8s le travail. Malgr\u00e9 ces efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires, le plaignant n'a eu droit \u00e0 aucun renforcement positif de la part du gend. Haney. Au contraire, vers la fin de f\u00e9vrier 1997, le gend. Haney a dit au plaignant qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas fait pour \u00eatre policier et qu'il devrait songer \u00e0 se r\u00e9orienter. Le plaignant a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 sur un ton de d\u00e9fi qu'il voulait r\u00e9ussir et qu'il ne d\u00e9missionnerait pas.\n[33] Malgr\u00e9 le manque de soutien de la part de son formateur, le plaignant avait bon espoir que tous les efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'il d\u00e9ployait porteraient fruit et que son \u00e9valuation pour la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode de deux mois serait meilleure. S'il \u00e9tait aussi confiant, c'est en partie parce qu'il avait commenc\u00e9 vers la fin de janvier 1997 \u00e0 patrouiller seul le district. Son formateur n'\u00e9tant pas \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui, il \u00e9tait moins tendu; il avait suffisamment confiance en ses moyens pour faire face \u00e0 n'importe quel d\u00e9fi qui se pr\u00e9senterait. Le gend. Haney a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le plaignant, \u00e0 l'instar de toutes les recrues qui font leurs premi\u00e8res patrouilles en solo, \u00e9tait observ\u00e9 pendant ses quarts de travail par son formateur et d'autres coll\u00e8gues, qui \u00e9taient dans d'autres v\u00e9hicules. Par cons\u00e9quent, le gend. Haney donnait un coup de main au plaignant lors de toutes les interventions, sauf celles qui \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s routini\u00e8res. Le gend. Haney se souvient qu'\u00e0 l'occasion de ces patrouilles en solo, le plaignant a d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises aux proc\u00e9dures en vigueur lors de ses interventions et de ses enqu\u00eates sur divers incidents.\n[34] Le rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement \u00e9tabli en date du 17 mars 1997, apr\u00e8s quatre mois de formation, a confirm\u00e9 que le plaignant avait atteint le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis dans plusieurs domaines, notamment en ce qui touche ses comp\u00e9tences au volant et en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du policier, ainsi que pour ce qui est de sa capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir un probl\u00e8me et de recueillir des renseignements. Cependant, le gend. Haney concluait que le stagiaire avait encore des lacunes et devait am\u00e9liorer son aptitude \u00e0 communiquer ainsi que sa connaissance du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures. En outre, il devait am\u00e9liorer certaines comp\u00e9tences (recueillir des d\u00e9clarations, apprendre \u00e0 prendre les choses en main lors d'un incident). Le gend. Haney a jug\u00e9 que, en tout et pour tout, le plaignant devait faire des progr\u00e8s relativement \u00e0 six des 28 crit\u00e8res, comparativement \u00e0 dix selon le rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement dress\u00e9 apr\u00e8s deux mois. Le formateur encourageait le plaignant \u00e0 continuer de faire montre d'une attitude positive et de d\u00e9termination au cours des deux derniers mois de sa FPR, tout en l'exhortant \u00e0 faire des efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires pour parfaire ses comp\u00e9tences. Le gend. Haney a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 un certain nombre d'activit\u00e9s visant \u00e0 aider le plaignant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer sa connaissance du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures, notamment sa participation \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de s\u00e9ances d'enseignement hebdomadaires que lui donnerait le gend. Haney en dehors des heures de service.\n[35] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u par le rapport. Il \u00e9tait clair dans son esprit qu'il \u00e9tait victime d'une injustice. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il travaillait d'arrache-pied et d\u00e9ployait beaucoup d'efforts, sa situation ne s'am\u00e9liorait pas. Il avait constamment maille \u00e0 partir avec le gend. Haney. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que son formateur voulait le voir \u00e9chouer. De l'avis du plaignant, les desseins du gend. Haney \u00e9taient enracin\u00e9s dans les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qu'il avait \u00e0 son endroit et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la couleur de sa peau. Le plaignant affirme qu'un incident survenu juste avant la pr\u00e9paration de son rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement apr\u00e8s quatre mois confirme ses doutes.\n[36] Un jour, alors que le gend. Haney et lui rev\u00eataient leur uniforme dans le vestiaire du poste de police, le formateur a trait\u00e9 le plaignant de cul de Kirby Puckett (Kirby Puckett Ass). Le plaignant s'est montr\u00e9 offens\u00e9, croyant que le premier mot prononc\u00e9 \u00e9tait, en fait, curvy (courb\u00e9) et qu'il s'agissait d'une allusion aux caract\u00e9ristiques de son torse inf\u00e9rieur. Qui plus est, il a associ\u00e9 le terme \u00e0 certains st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes racistes accol\u00e9s aux personnes d'ascendance africaine. Ce n'est que plus tard, au moment o\u00f9 il a communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne pour d\u00e9poser sa plainte, que le plaignant a appris que Kirby Puckett \u00e9tait un c\u00e9l\u00e8bre joueur de base-ball d'origine afro-am\u00e9ricaine. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, le gend. Haney a utilis\u00e9 ce terme (de m\u00eame que le terme OBO) \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il cesse d'assurer sa formation en mai 1997. Le plaignant affirme qu'il n'a jamais exprim\u00e9 d'objection \u00e0 ce qu'on l'appelle de cette fa\u00e7on parce que sa carri\u00e8re d\u00e9pendait de l'\u00e9valuation du gend. Haney et qu'il ne voulait pas risquer d'avoir un affrontement avec lui.\n[37] Le gend. Haney ne nie pas avoir employ\u00e9 le terme cul de Kirby Puckett mais situe la chose en contexte. Le plaignant et lui, ainsi que plusieurs autres policiers, avaient pourchass\u00e9, \u00e0 pied et en voiture, un suspect \u00e0 travers les rues de Burnaby. Le cap. Fischer a par la suite diffus\u00e9 une note pour f\u00e9liciter tous les policiers de l'excellent travail accompli lors de l'arrestation de l'individu en question. Durant la poursuite, alors que le gend. Haney courait apr\u00e8s le suspect, le plaignant est sorti de sa voiture de patrouille pour se lancer lui aussi \u00e0 la poursuite de l'individu. De retour au poste de police, le gend. Haney a demand\u00e9 au plaignant pourquoi il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de sortir de son v\u00e9hicule et de courir derri\u00e8re lui. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu qu'il courait plus vite que lui et qu'il lui serait plus facile de rattraper le fuyard. Le gend. Haney s'est inscrit en faux contre cette affirmation et il s'en est suivi un \u00e9change au cours duquel chacun a tent\u00e9 de convaincre l'autre de son talent de coureur. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de la conversation, le gend. Haney a qualifi\u00e9 le plaignant, sur un ton que ce dernier a qualifi\u00e9 d'ironique et de satirique, de cul de Kirby Puckett.\n[38] Le gend. Haney \u00e9tait conscient du fait que Kirby Puckett \u00e9tait un joueur de base-ball extr\u00eamement puissant r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour son torse large et muscl\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 intronis\u00e9 au Temple de la renomm\u00e9e du base-ball en raison de ses qualit\u00e9s athl\u00e9tiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa remarque faisait allusion au talent de coureur que pr\u00e9tendait avoir le plaignant, qu'il voyait comme une personne qui, de par sa musculature et son apparence, ressemblait \u00e0 Kirby Puckett. Le ton sarcastique impliquait que, m\u00eame s'il pr\u00e9tendait avoir l'habilet\u00e9 de Kirby Puckett, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. Le gend. Haney n'a jamais pens\u00e9 \u00e0 la race du joueur et n'a jamais eu l'intention d'utiliser le terme comme \u00e9pith\u00e8te raciste. Le gend. Haney se souvient que cette conversation a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s cordiale. En fait, le plaignant s'est tourn\u00e9 vers un autre policier qui se trouvait pr\u00e8s d'eux pour lui raconter ce que le gend. Haney venait de lui dire. Le policier en question a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] \u00c7a va car nous le [gend. Haney] surnommons tous parfois Dumbo \u00e0 cause de la forme de ses oreilles. Lorsquil a entendu cela, le plaignant s'est esclaff\u00e9, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant le mot Dumbo \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Le gend. Haney pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant l'a appel\u00e9 Dumbo plusieurs fois par la suite.\n[39] Le gend. Haney insiste sur le fait qu'il a utilis\u00e9 le terme cul de Kirby Puckett \u00e0 cinq reprises tout au plus, et ce, dans les jours qui ont suivi la discussion en question dans le vestiaire. Il soutient que le plaignant ne s'est jamais oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de ce surnom et que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il aurait aussit\u00f4t cess\u00e9 de l'utiliser. Selon le gend. Haney, le plaignant et lui employaient tr\u00e8s rarement des surnoms et s'appelaient par leur pr\u00e9nom 99 % du temps.\n[40] Au dire du plaignant, l'attitude du gend. Haney \u00e0 son endroit en dehors du travail d\u00e9notait \u00e9galement un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable. La fianc\u00e9e du plaignant, Natalie Cerrato, \u00e9tait all\u00e9e retrouver ce dernier \u00e0 Burnaby vers la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1996. Elle travaillait dans une sandwicherie locale ainsi qu'au d\u00e9tachement, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Le gend. Haney la connaissait; pourtant, les fois o\u00f9 elle l'avait servi \u00e0 la sandwicherie et o\u00f9 ils s'\u00e9taient crois\u00e9s au d\u00e9tachement, il avait fait semblant de ne pas la conna\u00eetre. De plus, le gend. Haney et le plaignant n'ont pas particip\u00e9 ensemble \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s sociales en dehors des heures de travail, sauf \u00e0 quelques occasions. Le formateur n'a jamais invit\u00e9 le plaignant et sa fianc\u00e9e \u00e0 venir lui rendre visite \u00e0 son domicile.\n[41] Toutefois, plusieurs policiers de la GRC ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessairement normal que des membres entretiennent des liens d'amiti\u00e9 et se rencontrent en dehors du travail. Le gend. Haney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le plaignant \u00e9tait toujours libre de lui rendre visite chez lui \u00e0 Coquitlam et qu'il l'avait d'ailleurs fait \u00e0 plusieurs reprises au cours des premi\u00e8res semaines de sa FPR. Toutefois, le gend. Haney a \u00e9galement fait remarquer qu'au moment o\u00f9 Mme Cerrato est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Burnaby, ses rapports professionnels avec le plaignant \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 tendus. Leur interaction se limitait, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, \u00e0 leur relation formateur-recrue. Ils avaient des r\u00f4les distincts, situation qui a peut-\u00eatre [TRADUCTION] caus\u00e9 un peu de stress suppl\u00e9mentaire et d\u00e9teint sur les rapports du formateur avec Mme Cerrato. Le gend. Haney a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas d'avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 au domicile du plaignant.\nD. Formation pratique - Cinqui\u00e8me et sixi\u00e8me mois [42] Au d\u00e9but du cinqui\u00e8me mois de la FPR, le gend. Haney a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 donner au plaignant ses s\u00e9ances d'enseignement hebdomadaires sur le droit, les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures, mesure qu'il avait recommand\u00e9e dans son rapport d'\u00e9valuation de rendement apr\u00e8s quatre mois. Le plaignant admet que l'organisation de ces s\u00e9ances \u00e9tait une initiative de son formateur. Le gend. Haney donnait ces s\u00e9ances chez lui en dehors des heures de travail. Le plaignant et lui touchaient tous les deux une prime pour heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Ces s\u00e9ances duraient des heures, au cours desquelles le gend. Haney et le plaignant examinaient une multitude de sc\u00e9narios. Ce programme a pris fin apr\u00e8s la troisi\u00e8me semaine, sans doute parce que le gend. Haney a d\u00fb aller suivre une formation en dehors du d\u00e9tachement. Elles n'ont jamais repris, situation que le plaignant a d\u00e9plor\u00e9e. Le gend. Haney a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait pas l'intention de donner au plaignant des s\u00e9ances d'enseignement jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de sa FPR. L'objectif de ces s\u00e9ances \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer les domaines dans lesquels le plaignant avait encore des lacunes. Il appartiendrait ensuite au stagiaire de concentrer ses \u00e9tudes sur les domaines en question.\n[43] Tout comme lors du mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le plaignant et le gend. Haney n'ont fait \u00e9quipe qu'occasionnellement dans la m\u00eame voiture de patrouille au cours des cinqui\u00e8me et sixi\u00e8me mois de la FPR. \u00c0 l'instar de toutes les recrues, le plaignant patrouillait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en solo. De plus, il \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me d'affectations rotatives et \u00e9tait, par cons\u00e9quent, appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e9galement dans d'autres sections du d\u00e9tachement.\n[44] Le 27 avril 1997, le gend. Michel Merritt s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au domicile d'un appelant auquel le plaignant, qui travaillait seul, s'\u00e9tait rendu en tant qu'intervenant primaire. Le propri\u00e9taire et un des locataires se querellaient au sujet de l'usage du logement et l'incident a d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 en bousculade. Le gend. Merritt a par la suite bl\u00e2m\u00e9 le plaignant, lui reprochant d'avoir accord\u00e9 trop d'importance au r\u00e8glement du diff\u00e9rend civil et de ne pas s'\u00eatre concentr\u00e9 sur l'enqu\u00eate pour voies de fait pour laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9 sur les lieux. Le gend. Merritt a consign\u00e9 cette observation dans le journal d'entra\u00eenement.\n[45] Le gend. Haney a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le rapport final d'\u00e9valuation de rendement le 17 mai 1997. Il a conclu que le plaignant avait des lacunes dans les m\u00eames six domaines que ceux qui \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9s dans le deuxi\u00e8me rapport, tout en ajoutant qu'il y avait place \u00e0 am\u00e9lioration dans un septi\u00e8me domaine - la gestion des dossiers. \u00c0 l'appui de ses conclusions, le formateur a annex\u00e9 \u00e0 son rapport un document d\u00e9taill\u00e9 faisant \u00e9tat de plusieurs incidents.\n[46] La pr\u00e9occupation exprim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 g\u00e9rer des dossiers d\u00e9coulait de ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 tenir ses dossiers \u00e0 jour et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre promptement aux demandes de ses superviseurs et des procureurs de la Couronne, entre autres. Le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement d\u00e9sorganis\u00e9 et n'avait pas jug\u00e9 bon de suivre plusieurs suggestions qu'il lui avait faites en vue d'am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de gestion de dossiers. Les dossiers dans son porte-documents \u00e9taient souvent tout ab\u00eem\u00e9s. Le plaignant a apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience le porte-documents. Il s'agit d'un fourre-tout \u00e0 flancs souples qui ressemble \u00e0 un sac athl\u00e9tique. \u00c0 mon avis, ce n'est pas le genre de porte-document dont on se sert d'habitude pour transporter des dossiers.\n[47] Le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il nourrissait encore certaines inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 communiquer dans sa langue seconde, mais qu'il \u00e9tait heureux de constater que ce dernier suivait des cours d'anglais en dehors des heures de travail. Il \u00e9tait encore plus pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant d'\u00e9tablir sans trop tarder ses rapports d'incident et tous les documents connexes. Le gend. Haney \u00e9tait d'avis que les rapports pr\u00e9sentaient souvent des lacunes et qu'il y manquait des d\u00e9tails n\u00e9cessaires, ce qui obligeait \u00e0 les refaire et retardait leur production. Selon le gend. Haney, le plaignant avait encore besoin de beaucoup de conseils et de surveillance en ce qui touche la r\u00e9daction de documents.\n[48] Le formateur a fait remarquer que le plaignant avait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on notable sa connaissance du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures au cours des mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, mais qu'il y avait encore place \u00e0 am\u00e9lioration. Il a cit\u00e9 plusieurs cas o\u00f9 cette lacune avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vidente. Alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre section du d\u00e9tachement, une r\u00e9plique d'arme de poing a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte et saisie. On a d'abord soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 que l'arme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour commettre une s\u00e9rie de vols \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e. Le plaignant s'est vu confier la t\u00e2che de faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'arme puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en cour comme pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 conviction. Lorsqu'il est retourn\u00e9 au poste, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver un membre de la Section des enqu\u00eates g\u00e9n\u00e9rales (SEG) auquel il pouvait confier l'arme. Par cons\u00e9quent, il l'a laiss\u00e9e sans surveillance pendant plusieurs heures dans le panier qui \u00e9tait sur son pupitre, rompant ainsi la continuit\u00e9 de sa possession. Enfin de compte, le soup\u00e7on initial concernant l'arme \u00e9tait non fond\u00e9 et aucune accusation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e. Cependant, selon le gend. Haney, le plaignant aurait d\u00fb agir comme s'il s'agissait d'une pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 conviction. Le gend. Haney a confront\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 ce sujet. Le plaignant a vivement r\u00e9agi, faisant valoir que son formateur \u00e9tait trop exigeant \u00e0 son endroit.\n[49] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti l\u00e9s\u00e9 par les reproches du gend. Haney. Il n'avait mis l'arme dans son panier qu'apr\u00e8s que l'enqu\u00eateur de la SEG d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9 sur les lieux du crime lui eut dit qu'aucune accusation au criminel ne serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l'arme en question et que le plaignant devrait s'en d\u00e9faire. Dans les circonstances, le probl\u00e8me de la continuit\u00e9 de possession ne se posait plus. Le plaignant a tent\u00e9 d'expliquer la situation au gend. Haney, mais ce dernier a refus\u00e9 d'accepter son explication.\n[50] Un autre incident similaire s'est produit. Cette fois-l\u00e0, on avait saisi une petite quantit\u00e9 de marijuana. Il s'agissait en l'occurrence de ce qu'on appelle dans le jargon du m\u00e9tier une saisie de drogue sans inculpation. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de prendre possession de la drogue saisie et d'enclencher le processus de destruction. Pour ce faire, il fallait remplir un formulaire relativement complexe. Plut\u00f4t que de le faire sans tarder, le plaignant a gard\u00e9 la drogue dans son casier pendant un mois, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 la politique du d\u00e9tachement et de la GRC. Le gend. Haney a \u00e9crit dans le rapport d'\u00e9valuation que cette situation \u00e9tait imputable aux tergiversations du plaignant. Il a ajout\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que si le plaignant trouvait difficile la t\u00e2che de remplir le formulaire, il aurait d\u00fb demander de l'aide plut\u00f4t que de laisser simplement une substance contr\u00f4l\u00e9e dans son casier. Le gend. Haney \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que le plaignant commettait encore ce genre d'erreur apr\u00e8s six mois de formation pratique.\n[51] Le plaignant s'est inscrit en faux contre la fa\u00e7on dont le gend. Haney a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ces incidents dans son rapport. La drogue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une unit\u00e9 de liaison communautaire sous la surveillance du gend. Anthony Akow. Une fois que les suspects trouv\u00e9s en possession des stup\u00e9fiants eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crou\u00e9s, le gend. Akow a ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de mettre la drogue dans son casier en attendant que les suspects puissent \u00eatre interrog\u00e9s et qu'une d\u00e9cision soit prise quant \u00e0 l'opportunit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des accusations. Une semaine plus tard, et au cours des deux semaines qui ont suivi, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 au gend. Akow si une d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Ce dernier lui a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. Finalement, environ un mois apr\u00e8s la date de la saisie, le gend. Akow a dit au plaignant qu'aucune accusation ne serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et lui a donn\u00e9 l'ordre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la destruction de la drogue. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a rempli le formulaire requis selon les normes de la GRC. C'est lorsque le gend. Haney a vu la recrue remplir ce formulaire qu'il l'a accus\u00e9e d'avoir tergivers\u00e9 et de ne pas avoir suivi la politique et la proc\u00e9dure en vigueur. Le plaignant a tent\u00e9 d'expliquer \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu'il avait simplement suivi les ordres, mais le gend. Haney n'a rien voulu entendre et n'a pas tent\u00e9 de faire confirmer par le gend. Akow l'explication du plaignant. Le plaignant a dit lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il s'est senti an\u00e9anti et victimis\u00e9 par la fa\u00e7on dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par son formateur.\n[52] Le plaignant a cit\u00e9 le gend. Akow comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l'audience. La version du gend. Akow diff\u00e8re de celle du plaignant. Il se souvient d'avoir dit au plaignant le soir m\u00eame de la saisie qu'aucune accusation ne serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et qu'il devrait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la destruction de la drogue. Il se souvient d'avoir crois\u00e9 quelques semaines plus tard le plaignant au d\u00e9tachement. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, le gend. Akow \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de police satellite et ne venait que tr\u00e8s rarement au bureau principal. Le plaignant l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas encore d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de la drogue. Le gend. Akow a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 d'entendre cela et se souvient d'avoir dit au plaignant que s'il ne connaissait pas la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, il devrait demander conseil \u00e0 son formateur ou \u00e0 un autre policier. Le plaignant n'a pas dit au gend. Akow \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque qu'il avait mis la marijuana dans son casier. Le gend. Akow ne l'a appris que peu de temps avant de venir t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience du Tribunal. \u00c0 son avis, il ne convenait pas de mettre la drogue \u00e0 cet endroit. Il y avait au poste de police deux s\u00e9ries d\u00e9sign\u00e9es de casiers o\u00f9 l'on gardait provisoirement des choses qui devaient servir de pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction. C'est \u00e0 cet endroit que le plaignant aurait d\u00fb entreposer la substance saisie. Le plaignant aurait d\u00fb conna\u00eetre l'existence de ces casiers, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi il aurait d\u00fb demander conseil \u00e0 son formateur ou \u00e0 un autre policier.\n[53] En ce qui concerne l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le gend. Haney a fait remarquer dans son rapport final d'\u00e9valuation que les notes du plaignant \u00e9taient encore incompl\u00e8tes. Il lui arrivait souvent de ne pas consigner dans son carnet des observations importantes; de plus, des d\u00e9tails importants (dates de naissance, num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, heures, etc.) \u00e9taient souvent manquants.\n[54] Les relations du plaignant avec le public ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es probl\u00e9matiques. Dans son rapport final d'\u00e9valuation, le gend. Haney a fait \u00e9tat de deux engueulades que le plaignant avait eues avec des citoyens. Son attitude conflictuelle \u00e9tait non professionnelle et inacceptable.\n[55] En outre, le gend. Haney a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 ses inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de prendre des d\u00e9cisions, ajoutant qu'il ferait sans doute des progr\u00e8s sur ce plan au fur et \u00e0 mesure que sa connaissance du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures ainsi que de leur application s'am\u00e9liorait. Il encourageait le plaignant \u00e0 demander conseil \u00e0 des membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur de la GRC et \u00e0 des experts afin de parfaire ses connaissances \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le gend. Haney a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit que le plaignant devait utiliser une approche fond\u00e9e sur le bon sens pour r\u00e9soudre des situations. \u00c0 titre d'exemple, le formateur a cit\u00e9 le cas o\u00f9 le plaignant a redonn\u00e9 \u00e0 un individu un v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9 qu'on avait retrouv\u00e9, sans avoir d'abord v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 son identit\u00e9 et le certificat d'immatriculation. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9 l'individu en question et qu'il avait convers\u00e9 avec lui en fran\u00e7ais avant de lui redonner le v\u00e9hicule. Il avait \u00e9tabli avec certitude que cette personne \u00e9tait bel et bien le concessionnaire d'automobiles qui avait signal\u00e9 le vol. Le gend. Haney a une fois de plus fait la sourde oreille aux explications que le plaignant tentait de lui donner.\n[56] Dans son rapport, le gend. Haney a conclu que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l'\u00e9thique du travail du plaignant \u00e9tait douteuse et que cela constituait un aspect \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer. Il avait tendance \u00e0 \u00e9carter les critiques faites dans le but de l'aider et il avait l'habitude de se comparer aux autres recrues en formation \u00e0 Burnaby, plut\u00f4t que de se concentrer sur ce qu'il devait faire personnellement pour r\u00e9ussir. N\u00e9anmoins, le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 qu'en redoublant d'effort et en \u00e9tant anim\u00e9 du d\u00e9sir d'apprendre, le plaignant pourrait r\u00e9ussir le programme de formation pratique. Il a donc recommand\u00e9 de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de formation du plaignant. Le sous-officier responsable de la formation \u00e0 Burnaby, le cap. Richard Cousins, a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que m\u00eame si, en th\u00e9orie, une recrue qui ne r\u00e9ussit pas sa FPR initiale de six mois peut faire l'objet d'une recommandation de lib\u00e9ration, la p\u00e9riode de formation est, d'apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience, habituellement prolong\u00e9e dans un tel cas. Selon le cap. Cousins, le fait de ne pas satisfaire \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 la fin de la FPR initiale est une indication non pas de l'incapacit\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussir, mais plut\u00f4t du fait qu'il doit \u00eatre davantage encadr\u00e9 et qu'il doit se perfectionner en vue de pouvoir atteindre les normes.\n[57] Le plaignant s'est inscrit en faux contre le rapport final d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tabli par le gend. Haney. Il se souvient que, malgr\u00e9 la conclusion plus ou moins optimiste du rapport, le gend. Haney lui avait dit quelques semaines auparavant qu'il n'y avait aucune garantie qu'une prolongation serait recommand\u00e9e dans son cas. Il avait ouvertement \u00e9mis des doutes quant \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant \u00e9tait fait pour \u00eatre policier. Ces observations avaient \u00e9videmment eu l'effet de d\u00e9courager encore plus le plaignant, qui avait fait des efforts consid\u00e9rables pour s'am\u00e9liorer.\n[58] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement choqu\u00e9 par les affirmations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le rapport selon lesquelles il ne s'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment appliqu\u00e9 et n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler fort. Il pr\u00e9tend que le gend. Haney l'accusait souvent durant sa FPR d'\u00eatre lent et paresseux. Le plaignant soutient que ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient non seulement non fond\u00e9es, mais aussi qu'elles t\u00e9moignaient de profonds pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux associ\u00e9s \u00e0 un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif voulant que les personnes de race noire soient paresseuses et l\u00e9thargiques. La communication de ces accusations par le gend. Haney aux superviseurs et \u00e0 d'autres membres de la GRC a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ternir de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9versible sa r\u00e9putation au sein du d\u00e9tachement.\n[59] Contrairement \u00e0 ce que les constatations de son formateur donnaient \u00e0 entendre, le plaignant se sentait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'aise dans son r\u00f4le de policier. Il se sentait \u00e0 l'aise lorsqu'il effectuait seul des patrouilles et face aux appels de toutes sortes auxquels il avait eu \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre par le pass\u00e9.\n[60] Une fois de plus, il \u00e9tait frustr\u00e9 de constater que le rapport ne faisait \u00e9tat d'aucun de ses nombreux bons coups ou des gestes exceptionnels qu'il avait pos\u00e9s au cours des deux mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Par exemple, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'on lui ait reproch\u00e9 d'avoir mis dans le panier qui \u00e9tait dans son bureau la r\u00e9plique d'arme de poing d'un suspect, il avait pris l'initiative de faire des recherches sur le d\u00e9tenu et avait d\u00e9couvert que ce dernier \u00e9tait un immigrant sous le coup d'une ordonnance d'expulsion. Le suspect avait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9 en d\u00e9tention puis remis aux autorit\u00e9s de l'Immigration.\n[61] Le rapport ne faisait pas mention non plus d'un autre cas o\u00f9 il avait bien r\u00e9agi qui \u00e9tait survenu le 16 avril 1997. Alors qu'il \u00e9tait en affectation dans une autre section et qu'il se dirigeait vers le palais de justice dans une voiture de police banalis\u00e9e en compagnie du gend. C.L. Ramos, le plaignant a observ\u00e9 une personne qui tentait de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer par effraction dans un v\u00e9hicule gar\u00e9. Ils se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s et ont appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 le suspect, qui \u00e9tait en possession de biens vol\u00e9s et avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de violence. Le gend. Ramos a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note de service (la Fiche de rendement 1004) f\u00e9licitant le plaignant de [TRADUCTION] son enthousiasme et de son excellente \u00e9thique du travail. Plusieurs superviseurs ont souscrit \u00e0 la note et l'ont f\u00e9licit\u00e9 en passant divers commentaires (bon travail, excellent, etc.).\n[62] Le 18 avril 1997, soit deux jours plus tard, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre section. Alors qu'il faisait \u00e9quipe avec le gend. R.S. Burns en tant que passager dans une voiture de police banalis\u00e9e, il a vu deux personnes en train de s'enfuir du lieu d'une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 altercation avec un troisi\u00e8me individu. Le plaignant est sorti de la voiture et a pourchass\u00e9 \u00e0 pied les deux suspects. Apr\u00e8s avoir appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 et immobilis\u00e9 le premier, il s'est mis \u00e0 la poursuite du deuxi\u00e8me suspect, qu'il a \u00e9galement attrap\u00e9. L'un et l'autre faisait l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate pour voies de fait et enl\u00e8vement. Le gend. Burns a indiqu\u00e9 par la suite que le plaignant avait fait montre de beaucoup d'enthousiasme en appr\u00e9hendant les suspects et que sa d\u00e9cision d'intervenir \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Le rapport d'\u00e9valuation ne faisait pas \u00e9tat de cette action d'\u00e9clat. Cependant, le gend. Haney a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que ce n'est que peu de temps avant son t\u00e9moignage en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ce fait.\n[63] Le plaignant souligne que le rapport passait \u00e9galement sous silence son travail au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ainsi, il ne faisait aucunement mention du fait qu'il s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 volontaire pour pr\u00e9senter des sc\u00e9narios aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves inscrits au projet Acad\u00e9mie de la jeunesse 1997 visant \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre la GRC aupr\u00e8s des jeunes. Le policier responsable de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement avait par la suite fait parvenir une lettre au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby pour exprimer sa gratitude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la contribution du plaignant.\n[64] Le gend. Haney conteste l'allusion voulant qu'il n'ait pas relev\u00e9 les succ\u00e8s du plaignant au cours de sa formation. Il soutient qu'il en a bel et bien tenu compte dans son \u00e9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Cependant, en bout de ligne, l'objectif du rapport d'\u00e9valuation et du programme de formation pratique en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer, au regard de tous les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis, si la recrue \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente. La norme du programme de formation pratique, qui tenait lieu de manuel des op\u00e9rations aux fins de la FPR, pr\u00e9cisait que les formateurs devaient, lorsqu'ils \u00e9tablissaient un rapport d'\u00e9valuation, se borner \u00e0 d\u00e9crire les points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ou les qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures. Si aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment semblable n'\u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9, on pr\u00e9sumait que la recrue \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente dans tous les domaines. S'il constatait quelque chose de [TRADUCTION] remarquablement mauvais, le formateur devait proposer dans son rapport des mesures correctives. En outre, le gend. Haney a ajout\u00e9 que son r\u00f4le en tant que formateur \u00e9tait de fournir au plaignant une appr\u00e9ciation exacte, franche et honn\u00eate de son niveau de rendement. Selon le gend. Haney, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 malhonn\u00eate de mettre en relief les r\u00e9alisations du plaignant et de minimiser ses lacunes. Cela aurait nui \u00e0 la formation du plaignant.\n[65] Dans la section du rapport final d'\u00e9valuation r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux observations du stagiaire, le plaignant n'a pas formul\u00e9 d'objection v\u00e9ritable, s'\u00e9tant r\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 tr\u00e8s fort au cours des deux mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et qu'il comprenait qu'il devait continuer de tenter d'am\u00e9liorer certains aspects. Il disait accepter la prolongation de sa FPR et d\u00e9clarait qu'il prouverait qu'il \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent dans tous les domaines.\nE. Premi\u00e8re prolongation de la formation pratique - Premier mois [66] Le cap. Cousins, qui dirigeait le programme de formation, a fait sienne la recommandation du gend. Haney visant \u00e0 prolonger de trois mois la p\u00e9riode de formation du plaignant. Comme on souhaitait recommencer \u00e0 neuf, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de muter le plaignant \u00e0 un autre district de la ville. Il allait travailler avec de nouveaux coll\u00e8gues et superviseurs, ainsi qu'avec un nouveau formateur. Il exercerait encore ses fonctions \u00e0 partir de l'immeuble principal du d\u00e9tachement. Pour sa part, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 au superviseur de son \u00e9quipe, le serg. Watts, si on pouvait cette fois le jumeler \u00e0 un formateur bilingue. Le gend. Haney ne parlait pas fran\u00e7ais, et le plaignant estimait qu'il aurait dans certains cas \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux compris par son formateur s'il avait pu s'exprimer dans sa langue maternelle.\n[67] Le serg. Watts a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le gend. Dave Carr, qu'il consid\u00e9rait comme tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tent et fort respect\u00e9 par ses coll\u00e8gues, \u00e0 titre de formateur durant la p\u00e9riode de prolongation. Le gend. Carr occupait un poste exigeant l'utilisation des deux langues officielles (c.-\u00e0-d. un poste bilingue). Cependant, au dire du plaignant, le gend. Carr avait peine \u00e0 dire une phrase en fran\u00e7ais. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait \u00e0 aucun moment \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de communiquer en fran\u00e7ais avec son nouveau formateur, particuli\u00e8rement dans les situations o\u00f9 il fallait prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Pour sa part, le gend. Carr a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de parler au plaignant presque exclusivement en anglais, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce dernier devait am\u00e9liorer sa connaissance de l'anglais.\n[68] La formation pratique du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du 13 juin 1997. Il a rencontr\u00e9 le gend. Carr et le cap. Lyle Avery, son nouveau superviseur. Ils ont discut\u00e9 des aspects probl\u00e9matiques et ont dress\u00e9 une liste de mesures correctives. Parmi ces mesures figurait l'engagement du plaignant \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les aptitudes de r\u00e9daction et le style des autres membres, \u00e0 accompagner durant ses temps libres d'autres policiers au cours de leurs patrouilles en voiture et \u00e0 adopter les techniques d'organisation personnelle du gend. Carr. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que les liens de communication entre les trois policiers seraient maintenus en tout temps. Le cap. Avery a soulign\u00e9 que le gend. Carr et lui voulaient que le plaignant r\u00e9ussisse.\n[69] La r\u00e9action du plaignant \u00e0 ce plan d'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 mitig\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait pour sa part m\u00e9content parce que la GRC n'avait pas jug\u00e9 opportun de le faire passer et de juger qu'il avait r\u00e9ussi sa formation pratique, mais il a continu\u00e9 de manifester une attitude positive et ouverte \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces directives. Somme toute, son plus ardent d\u00e9sir \u00e9tait de r\u00e9ussir.\n[70] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que le style du gend. Carr comme formateur contrastait grandement sous plusieurs rapports avec celui du gend. Haney. Le gend. Carr lui permettait de se servir des ordinateurs disponibles pour r\u00e9diger ses documents, ce qui lui permettait de produire beaucoup plus rapidement ses rapports. En outre, le ton du gend. Carr \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s professionnel; il ne criait pas apr\u00e8s le plaignant. Le gend. Carr ne l'interpellait pas en utilisant les \u00e9pith\u00e8tes soi-disant racistes qu'employait son ancien formateur (OBO et cul de Kirby Puckett). Le gend. Carr a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait auparavant entendu parler de la m\u00e9prise du plaignant relativement \u00e0 l'utilisation du terme OBO, mais que ce n'est que le jour o\u00f9 il a vu le plaignant \u00e9changer des messages avec le gend. Albert \u00e0 l'aide de l'ordinateur install\u00e9 dans la voiture de patrouille qu'il a entendu le surnom cul de Kirby Puckett. Le gend. Albert s'\u00e9tait adress\u00e9 ainsi au plaignant qui lui avait r\u00e9pondu en utilisant lui aussi un surnom. Le plaignant avait alors expliqu\u00e9 au gend. Carr que cul de Kirby Puckett \u00e9tait un surnom dont on l'avait affubl\u00e9 une fois. Il n'avait pas exprim\u00e9 de m\u00e9contentement quant \u00e0 l'emploi du terme.\n[71] N\u00e9anmoins, le gend. Carr avait recours \u00e0 certaines des techniques de formation du gend. Haney. Ainsi, il notait dans un journal les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la journ\u00e9e. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que la moindre erreur de sa part faisait l'objet d'une note dans le journal. Le gend. Carr prenait note \u00e9galement du temps qu'il fallait au plaignant pour r\u00e9diger ses rapports. Chaque fois qu'il commettait une erreur, le gend. Carr ne se g\u00eanait pas pour demander comment quelqu'un qui avait plus de six mois d'exp\u00e9rience pratique pouvait faire une telle erreur. Les tentatives du plaignant pour imputer ces lacunes \u00e0 la soi-disant pi\u00e8tre formation que le gend. Haney lui avait dispens\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par le gend. Carr. Cette r\u00e9action a eu l'effet d'une douche froide sur le plaignant, qui devint r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 poser des questions pour savoir comment ex\u00e9cuter certaines t\u00e2ches, ce qui a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 aggraver le probl\u00e8me.\n[72] Une conversation qu'il a eue avec le gend. Carr et le cap. Avery plusieurs semaines apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation n'a fait qu'accentuer sa frustration. Les deux membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur ont tent\u00e9 de le convaincre de songer \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner et \u00e0 se r\u00e9orienter. Leurs commentaires l'ont profond\u00e9ment perturb\u00e9. Il estimait que l'opinion qu'ils avaient de lui n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e et \u00e9tait injuste. Il ne pouvait comprendre pourquoi on avait prolong\u00e9 sa FPR si on \u00e9tait aussi certain qu'il ne r\u00e9ussirait pas. Comment pouvait-on pr\u00e9tendre qu'il recommen\u00e7ait \u00e0 neuf, alors qu'ils nourrissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 son endroit? Il \u00e9tait an\u00e9anti.\n[73] Le gend. Carr conteste ces all\u00e9gations. Le cap. Avery et lui d\u00e9siraient parler au plaignant des progr\u00e8s qu'il avait accomplis jusqu'alors. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu'il continuait d'\u00e9prouver des difficult\u00e9s dans sa formation et ils avaient jug\u00e9 opportun de proposer qu'il songe \u00e0 faire carri\u00e8re ailleurs que dans la police. Selon le gend. Carr, il \u00e9tait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du stagiaire qu'on se montre franc et honn\u00eate avec lui.\n[74] Le premier rapport d'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9par\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation (apr\u00e8s un mois), qui \u00e9tait dat\u00e9 du 3 ao\u00fbt 1997, faisait \u00e9tat des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es lacunes du plaignant. Le gend. Carr concluait qu'il y avait encore place \u00e0 am\u00e9lioration dans six des sept domaines o\u00f9 le plaignant pr\u00e9sentait des lacunes selon le rapport final du gend. Haney. On le consid\u00e9rait d\u00e9sormais comme comp\u00e9tent dans le septi\u00e8me domaine (gestion des incidents et des risques).\n[75] Le gend. Carr a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que le plaignant avait, en fait, d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence dans plusieurs des domaines o\u00f9 des lacunes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9es, et notamment en ce qui touche sa connaissance du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures et la gestion des dossiers. Toutefois, ces progr\u00e8s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9s dans les jours ou semaines ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport, et le gend. Carr estimait qu'il ne conviendrait de reclasser le plaignant tant qu'on n'aurait pas observ\u00e9 une certaine constance pendant une plus longue p\u00e9riode.\n[76] Le formateur estimait que le plaignant pr\u00e9sentait encore des lacunes \u00e9videntes dans plusieurs des autres domaines. L'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 communiquer demeurait probl\u00e9matique. Comme il avait encore de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire en anglais, il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement p\u00e9nible pour lui de r\u00e9diger des documents. Toutefois, le gend. Carr a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait des difficult\u00e9s non seulement pour ce qui est du contenu des rapports - il n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr des renseignements qu'il devait inclure -, mais aussi sur le plan de la forme. \u00c0 cause de ces probl\u00e8mes, il mettait un temps d\u00e9mesur\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger ses rapports; souvent, il devait s'y reprendre \u00e0 deux ou trois fois. Le gend. Carr a fait remarquer que le plaignant avait tendance \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger l'aspect paperasse, tellement r\u00e9diger \u00e9tait pour lui une t\u00e2che p\u00e9nible.\n[77] Le plaignant conteste le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette opinion. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il s'en remet aux constatations de la gend. Dana Lillies, qui avait remplac\u00e9 le gend. Carr \u00e0 titre de formatrice pendant dix quarts de travail en juillet 1997. Elle a \u00e9crit dans le journal qu'hormis le fait qu'il fallait remanier une phrase de temps \u00e0 autre, les travaux de r\u00e9daction du plaignant \u00e9taient satisfaisants. Elle n'a relev\u00e9 aucun probl\u00e8me quant au contenu des rapports. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle n'a observ\u00e9 aucune lacune importante relativement \u00e0 son rendement, bien qu'elle ait admis que tous les appels auxquels ils avaient r\u00e9pondu \u00e9taient de nature relativement courante. Dans un cas particulier, le plaignant avait r\u00e9agi rapidement et pourchass\u00e9 \u00e0 pied un suspect qui avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s'\u00e9chapper de la voiture de patrouille.\n[78] En outre, le gend. Carr a signal\u00e9 que le plaignant manquait de bon sens et prenait des d\u00e9cisions qui d\u00e9fiaient la logique. Par exemple, un jour o\u00f9 il se trouvait sur les lieux d'un d\u00e9c\u00e8s (cas de mort subite), il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'enregistrer la d\u00e9position d'un t\u00e9moin, dans une atmosph\u00e8re tumultueuse, alors que le cadavre \u00e9tait encore sur place et que les gens \u00e9taient sous le choc. On a fait remarquer au plaignant par la suite qu'une d\u00e9position \u00e9crite aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de beaucoup pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable dans les circonstances. Quelques semaines plus tard, le plaignant s'est rendu sur les lieux d'un vol de sac \u00e0 main. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 encore une fois d'enregistrer la d\u00e9position de la victime, qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e, sous un quai d'une gare de banlieue du Skytrain o\u00f9 il r\u00e9gnait un bruit infernal et o\u00f9 circulaient beaucoup de passants. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus opportun de prendre une br\u00e8ve d\u00e9position \u00e9crite. Au dire du plaignant, ces critiques sont injustes. Comme il avait constamment \u00e9t\u00e9 chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches, il avait pris l'habitude, a-t-il fait remarquer, d'enregistrer les d\u00e9positions plut\u00f4t que de les prendre sous la dict\u00e9e parce que c'\u00e9tait plus rapide.\n[79] De plus, le gend. Carr a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il y avait lieu ou non de d\u00e9poser des accusations contre quelqu'un. Dans un cas particulier, il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, avant d'avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, de ne pas inculper un jeune contrevenant. Il s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'un avertissement avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au jeune en question, \u00e9l\u00e9ment dont il faut tenir compte lorsqu'on d\u00e9cide s'il y a lieu de d\u00e9poser des accusations. Dans un autre cas, le plaignant a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur-le-champ au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'accusations alors qu'il s'agissait de voies de fait simples et qu'il \u00e9tait, de toute \u00e9vidence, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable selon l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que les parties r\u00e8glent l'affaire \u00e0 l'amiable. Le gend. Carr a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant et lui avaient \u00e9labor\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie visant \u00e0 lui apprendre \u00e0 r\u00e9agir aux situations avec bon sens et logique et que cette strat\u00e9gie serait mise en uvre au cours des deux autres mois de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation. En d\u00e9pit de ces pr\u00e9occupations, le formateur a admis dans le rapport que, malgr\u00e9 tout, le plaignant avait pris [TRADUCTION] certaines bonnes d\u00e9cisions dans les derniers temps.\n[80] En ce qui concerne les techniques d'enqu\u00eate sur les lieux d'un crime et de collecte d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le gend. Carr a fait remarquer que le plaignant \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 bout des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usage de son carnet. Cependant, le gend. Carr disait s'inqui\u00e9ter de ce que le plaignant paraisse souvent heureux de laisser des coll\u00e8gues prendre la rel\u00e8ve sur les lieux d'un crime plut\u00f4t que de prendre lui-m\u00eame les choses en main.\n[81] Dans ses conclusions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, le gend. Carr disait souscrire au constat du gend. Haney, \u00e0 savoir que le plaignant rejetait souvent le bl\u00e2me sur autrui. Il affirmait souvent que s'il continuait d'\u00e9prouver des difficult\u00e9s, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause du gend. Haney. Dans son rapport, le gend. Carr a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que chaque fois que la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de prendre des d\u00e9cisions logiques, fond\u00e9es sur le bon sens, \u00e9tait remise en question, ce dernier paraissait incapable de comprendre le principe et rejetait constamment le bl\u00e2me sur quelqu'un d'autre, pr\u00e9textant que l'individu en question lui avait dit de faire les choses de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[82] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance du document, le plaignant a consign\u00e9 ses propres observations sur la formule, comme il l'avait fait dans les rapports ant\u00e9rieurs d'\u00e9valuation de rendement. Il a \u00e9crit qu'il avait fait des efforts \u00e9normes depuis le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation de sa FPR et qu'il continuerait de faire de son mieux jusqu'\u00e0 la fin.\nF. Premi\u00e8re prolongation de la formation pratique - Deuxi\u00e8me mois [83] Dans le rapport d'\u00e9valuation suivant, qui porte la date du 31 ao\u00fbt 1997, le gend. Carr admet que le plaignant a vraiment [TRADUCTION] redoubl\u00e9 d'effort au cours du deuxi\u00e8me mois de sa prolongation. Il indique que le plaignant a accompagn\u00e9 d'autres policiers dans des voitures de patrouille pendant ses temps libres, notamment le gend. Luc Montmarquette, qui a consign\u00e9 ses observations sur une fiche de rendement 1004. De l'avis du gend. Montmarquette, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses appels de fa\u00e7on professionnelle, sans probl\u00e8me, et a fait montre d'un bon jugement dans ses rapports avec les victimes. Cependant, le gend. Montmarquette a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'ils n'avaient r\u00e9pondu qu'\u00e0 des appels peu importants durant leurs quarts de travail ensemble. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant poss\u00e9dait toutes les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre policier.\n[84] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 d'accompagner un autre policier, le gend. Randy Marx, pendant un quart de huit heures. Dans la fiche de rendement 1004 qu'il a remplie par la suite, le gend. Marx signale que le plaignant avait dirig\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eate dans une affaire d'agression et qu'il s'\u00e9tait comport\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s professionnelle. Le gend. Marx a constat\u00e9 l'existence d'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re barri\u00e8re linguistique dans ses conversations et la r\u00e9daction de ses rapports; toutefois, il a dit avoir bon espoir que les difficult\u00e9s que le plaignant \u00e9prouvait sur ce plan allaient s'estomper au fil du temps. Il estimait que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le plaignant s'\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de ses fonctions conform\u00e9ment aux attentes. Le gend. Marx a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'aurait aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 travailler avec lui \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[85] Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter, cependant, que le gend. Marx a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 cinq jours plus tard une autre fiche de rendement 1004 dans laquelle il semblait mettre un b\u00e9mol sur certains commentaires favorables formul\u00e9s dans sa note ant\u00e9rieure. Il a soulign\u00e9 le fait que son \u00e9valuation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un seul quart de travail et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure, par cons\u00e9quent, d'\u00e9valuer en profondeur le rendement du plaignant. Dans la fiche de rendement, le gend. Marx a indiqu\u00e9 que le plaignant avait peut-\u00eatre le sentiment d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mal \u00e9valu\u00e9 par ses formateurs, mais il a ajout\u00e9 que s'il avait travaill\u00e9 avec le stagiaire pendant un mois ou deux, il en serait peut-\u00eatre venu \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion qu'eux. Le gend. Marx a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re fiche de rendement 1004, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles le plaignant avait fait face durant sa FPR. Il s'est rendu compte par la suite que son premier rapport pourrait \u00eatre mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 et jugeait important de mettre les points sur les i. Le cap. Avery se souvient vaguement de s'\u00eatre entretenu avec le gend. Marx de la premi\u00e8re fiche de rendement et avoir dit \u00e0 ce dernier qu'il conviendrait de s'en tenir \u00e0 des observations r\u00e9elles et de s'abstenir de tirer des conclusions tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sans avoir eu l'occasion de travailler de fa\u00e7on suivie avec le stagiaire.\n[86] Le rapport d'\u00e9valuation faisait \u00e9tat de quelques am\u00e9liorations depuis l'\u00e9valuation ant\u00e9rieure. Le plaignant \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme comp\u00e9tent en ce qui touche la gestion des dossiers et la connaissance et l'application du droit, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures. Cependant, il avait encore des progr\u00e8s \u00e0 faire relativement \u00e0 trois des crit\u00e8res.\n[87] Le gend. Carr \u00e9tait encore d'avis que l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 communiquer laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. En raison de ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9diger en anglais, la r\u00e9daction des rapports demeurait une t\u00e2che p\u00e9nible. Le plaignant devait habituellement r\u00e9diger deux versions pour en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat acceptable. La version initiale devait souvent faire l'objet d'une correction d'\u00e9preuves par quelqu'un d'autre. Afin d'aider la plaignant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences r\u00e9dactionnelles, le gend. Carr avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui fournir des sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques enregistr\u00e9s sur des supports audio. Le plaignant devait \u00e9couter les bandes et se pratiquer \u00e0 r\u00e9diger des rapports destin\u00e9s au procureur de la Couronne. Le formateur faisait ensuite une relecture d'\u00e9preuves et apportait les corrections voulues. En outre, le plaignant s'est inscrit \u00e0 un cours sur l'art de r\u00e9diger offert par la GRC. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le gend. Carr a dit \u00eatre plut\u00f4t d\u00e9\u00e7u de constater que le plaignant n'avait pas cherch\u00e9 depuis son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Burnaby \u00e0 suivre un cours d'anglais structur\u00e9.\n[88] Le plaignant s'inscrit en faux contre cette derni\u00e8re remarque et l'insinuation qu'il n'avait rien fait pour am\u00e9liorer son anglais \u00e9crit. En janvier 1997, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Division E (Colombie-Britannique) \u00e0 Vancouver pour s'enqu\u00e9rir des cours d'anglais offerts dans la r\u00e9gion. Il s'est inscrit au cours qu'on lui avait recommand\u00e9 au Coll\u00e8ge Capicollo; toutefois, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le manuel du cours, il a constat\u00e9 que le volet grammaire \u00e9tait insuffisant. Il a donc demand\u00e9 qu'on l'autorise \u00e0 suivre par correspondance un cours mieux adapt\u00e9 qu'offrait l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu'on a estim\u00e9 qu'il valait mieux qu'il suive sa formation en Colombie-Britannique. Entre-temps, il s'est inscrit de sa propre initiative au cours de la GRC sur l'art de r\u00e9diger. Aucun de ses superviseurs ne lui avait jamais parl\u00e9 de ce cours. C'est un autre policier, le gend. Albert, qui avait lui-m\u00eame suivi le cours, qui a appris au plaignant l'existence de celui-ci.\n[89] Par ailleurs, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 par un commentaire que lui a fait \u00e0 ce sujet son superviseur, le cap. Lyle Avery. Pri\u00e9 d'expliquer pourquoi il mettait autant de temps \u00e0 r\u00e9diger ses rapports, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu qu'il traduisait du fran\u00e7ais vers l'anglais et qu'il corrigeait ensuite les fautes d'orthographe. Le cap. Avery a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 que son fils \u00e9tudiait le fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et qu'il ne lui fallait pas autant de temps pour faire ses devoirs. Le cap. Avery a ajout\u00e9 que l'explication ne r\u00e9sidait pas dans la barri\u00e8re linguistique, mais plut\u00f4t dans l'inaptitude du plaignant \u00e0 r\u00e9diger des rapports. Le plaignant croyait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal jug\u00e9. Il se sentait humili\u00e9 d'\u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9colier.\n[90] En ce qui concerne les techniques d'enqu\u00eate sur les lieux d'un crime et de collecte d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le gend. Carr a soutenu que le plaignant n'avait pas encore atteint le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis. Il a admis qu'il avait fait des progr\u00e8s dans certains domaines, notamment en ce qui touche la prise de d\u00e9positions et son temps de r\u00e9ponse aux appels. Cependant, le gend. Carr a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 des cas o\u00f9 le plaignant ne semblait pas conna\u00eetre la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des situations similaires \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises auparavant.\n[91] Abstraction faite des lacunes ayant trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction des rapports, il semble que la prise de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9tait l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui laissait le plus \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Le gend. Carr a fait observer que, lorsqu'il prenait des d\u00e9cisions, le plaignant avait tendance \u00e0 penser de fa\u00e7on lin\u00e9aire et avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 voir la situation dans son ensemble, y compris des \u00e9l\u00e9ments intangibles comme l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Le gend. Carr a fourni au plaignant d'autres sc\u00e9narios sur bande afin qu'il puisse s'exercer \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance des faits dans chaque affaire, le plaignant devait d\u00e9terminer s'il y avait lieu de d\u00e9poser des accusations. Le gend. Carr a constat\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir fait ces exercices, le plaignant commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 saisir la notion d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[92] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le gend. Carr a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait fait des progr\u00e8s le mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 fort pour combler ses lacunes. Le cap. Avery, \u00e0 titre de superviseur du gend. Carr et du plaignant, a ajout\u00e9 ses propres commentaires dans le rapport. Il a soulign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 l'honneur du plaignant d'avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 atteindre le niveau de comp\u00e9tence voulu dans certains domaines o\u00f9 l'on avait auparavant d\u00e9cel\u00e9 des lacunes. Le cap. Avery a reconnu que le plaignant poursuivait ses efforts en vue d'acqu\u00e9rir la comp\u00e9tence voulue dans les trois autres domaines et lui a donn\u00e9 l'assurance suivante : [TRADUCTION] Nous continuerons de vous fournir toute l'aide possible.\nG. Premi\u00e8re prolongation de la formation pratique - Troisi\u00e8me mois [93] Le 30 septembre 1997, au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9tabli son troisi\u00e8me et dernier rapport d'\u00e9valuation, le gend. Carr en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le plaignant avait atteint le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis dans les domaines des communications et des techniques d'enqu\u00eate sur les lieux d'un crime et de collecte d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Cependant, il y avait encore des progr\u00e8s \u00e0 faire en ce qui concerne la prise des d\u00e9cisions.\n[94] Le gend. Carr a indiqu\u00e9 que cet aspect \u00e9tait un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation depuis qu'il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 former le plaignant. Au d\u00e9but, le probl\u00e8me avait trait \u00e0 son incapacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider s'il y avait lieu de d\u00e9poser des accusations. L'exp\u00e9rience aidant, y compris le recours aux sc\u00e9narios, le plaignant avait fait des progr\u00e8s et on n'avait pas constat\u00e9 d'autres probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant, le gend. Carr estimait que le plaignant continuait d'avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre les d\u00e9cisions de base dans le m\u00e9tier de policier. Il ne regardait pas la situation dans son ensemble. Il semblait s'\u00e9nerver et prendre ses d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la h\u00e2te sans tenir compte de leurs cons\u00e9quences. Le gend. Carr et le gend. Albert, qui avait agi comme le formateur du plaignant pendant un certain nombre de quarts de travail en l'absence du gend. Carr, avaient tous deux constat\u00e9 ce probl\u00e8me et lui avaient conseill\u00e9 de ralentir la cadence et de bien m\u00fbrir ses d\u00e9cisions avant de les prendre.\n[95] Dans son rapport, le gend. Carr citait des exemples d'erreurs commises par le plaignant dans la prise de d\u00e9cision. Alors qu'il \u00e9tait en compagnie du gend. Albert, le plaignant a arr\u00eat\u00e9 une jeune voleuse \u00e0 l'\u00e9talage de 15 ans. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la ramener au foyer de groupe o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait. Son intention \u00e9tait de la d\u00e9poser devant le foyer et de s'en aller. En ne la raccompagnant pas jusqu'\u00e0 la porte pour la confier aux soins du personnel du foyer, il avait couru le risque qu'elle prenne la poudre d'escampette aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part.\n[96] Un autre incident s'\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 l'occasion de ce qui semblait \u00eatre une tentative de suicide. La femme \u00e9tait atteinte au thorax par balles. Plusieurs policiers \u00e9taient sur place. Le gend. Peter Maw supervisait l'op\u00e9ration. Alors que le gend. Carr et un autre policier dispensaient les premiers soins \u00e0 la femme bless\u00e9e, le plaignant a re\u00e7u l'ordre de surveiller un homme qui se trouvait sur les lieux - un \u00e9ventuel suspect. Quelques minutes plus tard, deux enqu\u00eateurs de la SEG sont arriv\u00e9s. Au d\u00e9but, il leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de trouver le suspect pour l'interroger. Ce dernier a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 seul sur un balcon, loin des lieux du crime, en train de griller une cigarette. Le plaignant \u00e9tait apparemment sorti pour aller chercher un magn\u00e9tophone dans la voiture de police et avait laiss\u00e9 le suspect sans surveillance.\n[97] L'un des enqu\u00eateurs, le gend. Theodore Van Overbeek, s'est par la suite plaint au cap. Avery du comportement du plaignant. Le plaignant a ni\u00e9 avoir mal agi, soutenant que le gend. Maw, un membre de rang sup\u00e9rieur, lui avait donn\u00e9 l'ordre d'aller chercher le magn\u00e9tophone. Il avait cru comprendre que le gend. Maw surveillerait le suspect dans l'intervalle. Le gend. Maw a contest\u00e9 cette affirmation lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Fait int\u00e9ressant, le gend. Van Overbeek a \u00e9tabli par la suite une fiche de rendement 1004 pour f\u00e9liciter le plaignant de la mani\u00e8re dont il avait recueilli les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lors de l'incident. Le gend. Van Overbeek a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 la note en question \u00e0 la demande du gend. Carr, qui lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que le plaignant avait besoin d'un certain renforcement positif.\n[98] Dans le rapport d'\u00e9valuation, le gend. Carr fait \u00e9tat d'un autre cas illustrant les lacunes du plaignant en ce qui concerne la prise de d\u00e9cisions. Le plaignant et lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9s sur les lieux d'une violente altercation entre deux surs adolescentes. Les parents \u00e9taient absents. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 la situation, le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'arr\u00eater les deux surs afin de les garder \u00e9loign\u00e9es l'une de l'autre. Le gend. Carr lui a reproch\u00e9 de ne pas avoir r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 ce qu'il ferait des deux jeunes contrevenantes qu'il avait arr\u00eat\u00e9es sans avoir l'intention de d\u00e9poser des accusations. Il n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de les incarc\u00e9rer. La m\u00e8re des deux surs est revenue \u00e0 la maison un peu plus tard. Le plaignant a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui confier l'affaire. Il a admis que sa d\u00e9cision initiale n'\u00e9tait pas la meilleure tout en soulignant qu'il n'avait jamais fait face \u00e0 pareille situation dans le pass\u00e9. Lorsqu'il a demand\u00e9 conseil au gend. Carr, celui-ci a insist\u00e9 pour qu'il prenne une d\u00e9cision sur-le-champ.\n[99] Le gend. Carr a soulign\u00e9 que chaque fois qu'il parlait au plaignant de ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions, celui-ci ne semblait pas croire qu'il y avait l\u00e0 un probl\u00e8me. Selon le gend. Carr, le plaignant r\u00e9pondait que toutes les difficult\u00e9s qu'il \u00e9prouvait \u00e9taient attribuables aux pressions qu'il subissait et aux probl\u00e8mes qui avaient exist\u00e9 entre lui et son premier formateur, le gend. Haney. Le gend. Carr a rejet\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention, faisant valoir qu'il n'avait constat\u00e9 rien qui lui permettait d'ajouter foi \u00e0 une telle affirmation depuis les trois mois et demi qu'il travaillait avec le plaignant. Le gend. Carr a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les diff\u00e9rends qui existent entre deux personnes ne peuvent affecter la capacit\u00e9 de prendre de bonnes d\u00e9cisions. Il a termin\u00e9 son rapport en faisant remarquer que le plaignant \u00e9tait aim\u00e9 par ses coll\u00e8gues, qu'il travaillait bien en \u00e9quipe et qu'il \u00e9tait un policier enthousiaste.\n[100] Le cap. Avery a ajout\u00e9 ses propres commentaires \u00e0 ceux du gend. Carr. Il a dit souscrire aux constatations de ce dernier. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me du plaignant r\u00e9sidait dans son incapacit\u00e9 de fonctionner sous pression [TRADUCTION] dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable en tant que membre d'une \u00e9quipe qui \u00e9tait constamment appel\u00e9e \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter des interventions en respectant des normes de qualit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e, tout en \u00e9tant en mesure de passer \u00e0 l'appel suivant sans faire l'objet d'une surveillance constante. Le cap. Avery a ajout\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 son avis, le plaignant avait eu la chance d'\u00eatre sous la tutelle de deux excellents formateurs.\n[101] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport final d'\u00e9valuation de rendement, le plaignant est rentr\u00e9 chez lui \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9 il a pass\u00e9 quelques semaines. Il \u00e9tait an\u00e9anti et d\u00e9courag\u00e9, \u00e9tant presque certain d'\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour ne pas avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 un des 28 crit\u00e8res de sa FPR. Au cours des mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le plaignant avait parl\u00e9 de ses difficult\u00e9s avec le cap. Les Allen. Le cap. Allen \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au Programme de repr\u00e9sentants divisionnaires des relations fonctionnelles (PRDRF) \u00e0 titre de sous-repr\u00e9sentant responsable du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Comme les membres de la GRC n'\u00e9taient pas syndiqu\u00e9s, on avait mis sur pied le PRDRF afin de repr\u00e9senter leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats collectifs et individuels au sein de la GRC. Lorsqu'il devint \u00e9vident vers la fin de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation que le plaignant ne satisferait pas \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res de sa FPR, le cap. Allen a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 laisser savoir \u00e0 la haute direction qu'il demanderait une deuxi\u00e8me prolongation de la FPR du plaignant.\n[102] La d\u00e9cision d'accorder ou non une deuxi\u00e8me prolongation appartenait au cap. Cousins, \u00e0 l'insp. Dennis Schlecker, l'officier responsable des op\u00e9rations au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, et au sergent d'\u00e9tat-major (serg. \u00e9.-m.) Colin Abel, le sous-officier responsable du programme de formation pratique \u00e0 la Division E, dont le r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 superviser la formation dispens\u00e9e par tous les d\u00e9tachements de la Division. Alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, plusieurs r\u00e9unions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9es afin de discuter de son avenir dans la GRC. Le serg. Watts et le gend. Carr ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que le plaignant ne serait pas en mesure de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ses lacunes relativement \u00e0 une des aptitudes fondamentales d'un policier, soit la capacit\u00e9 de prendre de bonnes d\u00e9cisions. Ils ont recommand\u00e9 de ne pas prolonger la formation du plaignant.\n[103] Le cap. Cousins h\u00e9sitait lui aussi \u00e0 accorder une nouvelle prolongation, mais il continuait de croire que le plaignant avait le potentiel n\u00e9cessaire pour devenir un membre comp\u00e9tent. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a affirm\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confort\u00e9 dans son opinion par les observations du cap. Allen. Le cap. Cousins a recommand\u00e9 de prolonger la FPR de deux mois, \u00e0 la condition que le plaignant reconnaisse qu'il avait des lacunes dans le domaine de la prise de d\u00e9cisions et qu'il fasse des efforts concert\u00e9s pour am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le cap. Cousins \u00e9tait d'avis que le stagiaire n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 atteindre le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis en partie parce qu'il avait tendance \u00e0 rejeter sur d'autres la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses lacunes et \u00e0 adopter une attitude indign\u00e9e lorsque ses formateurs tentaient de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 celles-ci.\n[104] L'insp. Schlecker a fait siennes les recommandations du cap. Cousins. La FPR du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e que l'insp. Schlecker a curieusement d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] d'au plus et d'au moins deux (2) mois dans la note de service qu'il a adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'officier responsable du d\u00e9tachement. Au cours de la prolongation, les \u00e9valuations porteraient sur la prise des d\u00e9cisions. Un nouveau formateur serait d\u00e9sign\u00e9, \u00e9tant entendu que cette personne donnerait des exemples illustrant les efforts faits pour aider le plaignant et les r\u00e9sultats de l'aide apport\u00e9e. Si le plaignant n'atteignait pas un niveau de rendement acceptable en mati\u00e8re de prise de d\u00e9cisions, on recommanderait d'office son cong\u00e9diement.\n[105] Lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, l'insp. Schlecker et le cap. Cousins ont indiqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois de leur carri\u00e8re, au cours de laquelle ils s'\u00e9taient occup\u00e9s de la formation de centaines de recrues, qu'ils voyaient une deuxi\u00e8me prolongation d'une FPR. Le serg. \u00e9.-m. Abel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le programme de formation pratique ne pr\u00e9voit pas express\u00e9ment la possibilit\u00e9 d'une deuxi\u00e8me prolongation.\nH. Deuxi\u00e8me prolongation de la formation pratique - Premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me semaines [106] Durant son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le plaignant a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ses observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rapport final d'\u00e9valuation du 30 septembre 1997. Une fois dactylographi\u00e9, le texte comptait 14 pages. Il a profit\u00e9 de l'occasion pour exprimer son opinion \u00e0 propos de tous les rapports d'\u00e9valuation ant\u00e9rieurs. Il a donn\u00e9 son point de vue sur certains incidents pour lesquels on lui avait adress\u00e9 des reproches. Il a soulign\u00e9 qu'on avait souvent omis dans ces rapports de mentionner les aspects positifs de son rendement. Au sujet de la p\u00e9riode de prolongation, il a indiqu\u00e9 que le gend. Carr \u00e9tait un excellent formateur. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le gend. Carr avait sacrifi\u00e9 beaucoup d'heures de loisirs pour l'aider \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 patient avec lui et qu'il l'avait trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable jusqu'\u00e0 la fin. Le plaignant n'a pas fourni d'\u00e9valuation, positive ou n\u00e9gative, au sujet du gend. Haney. Dans ses observations, le plaignant n'a jamais all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni insinu\u00e9 que le gend. Haney ou le gend. Carr l'avait trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. Le plaignant a conclu en disant que [TRADUCTION] nous apprenons tous de nos erreurs. Il demandait qu'on prolonge \u00e0 nouveau sa formation si ses sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e9taient d'avis que son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions laissait encore \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[107] \u00c0 son retour au d\u00e9tachement \u00e0 la mi-octobre 1997, le plaignant a remis ses observations. Il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des \u00e9changes que ses sup\u00e9rieurs avaient eus au sujet de sa FPR. Il avait tenu pour acquis qu'il serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Ce n'est qu'au moment de son arriv\u00e9e au d\u00e9tachement, le 16 octobre 1997, lorsqu'il a regard\u00e9 dans son panier et qu'il a trouv\u00e9 une copie de la note de service de l'insp. Schlecker \u00e9non\u00e7ant les conditions de sa nouvelle prolongation, qu'il a appris que sa formation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e.\n[108] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu'il travaillerait avec une toute nouvelle \u00e9quipe de policiers dans un district diff\u00e9rent - l'un des plus occup\u00e9s de Burnaby. Le serg. Murray Ross, qui \u00e9tait le chef de veille de l'\u00e9quipe, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de d\u00e9signer un formateur. De concert avec le sous-officier qui serait en charge de la patrouille, le cap. Larry Johnson, le serg. Ross a choisi comme nouveau formateur le gend. Dwayne McDonald. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le serg. Ross a d\u00e9crit le gend. McDonald comme un excellent policier qui avait beaucoup de maturit\u00e9, m\u00eame s'il avait relativement peu d'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Le gend. McDonald avait form\u00e9 d'autres policiers de la GRC; de plus, au cours de sa carri\u00e8re, alors qu'il \u00e9tait inspecteur des douanes, il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation de nouveaux douaniers.\n[109] Le 21 octobre 1997, le gend. McDonald et le cap. Johnson ont rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour discuter du type de formation qu'il recevrait. Les superviseurs ont convenu, et le plaignant s'est dit d'accord avec cela, qu'il ferait \u00e9quipe avec le formatteur pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de la prolongation. Il serait responsable de traiter, d'\u00e9tudier et de piloter tous les dossiers, et le gend. McDonald pourrait lui venir en aide, mais seulement s'il le lui demandait. Le gend. McDonald \u00e9valuerait le stagiaire strictement en fonction de son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions et r\u00e9digerait un compte rendu hebdomadaire d'activit\u00e9s. Le plaignant avait exprim\u00e9 la crainte que ses exp\u00e9riences avec ses formateurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents allaient jouer contre lui; toutefois, le gend. McDonald lui a donn\u00e9 l'assurance qu'il s'agirait d'un nouveau d\u00e9part. Le gend. McDonald avait pris connaissance du dossier du plaignant, y compris les rapports d'\u00e9valuation ant\u00e9rieurs, mais il ne savait rien du plaignant et ne connaissait que tr\u00e8s peu l'un de ses formateurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le gend. Carr. Dans une note de suivi, le gend. McDonald a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait bon espoir que cette strat\u00e9gie serait \u00e0 l'avantage du plaignant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'existerait aucun [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 favorable ou d\u00e9favorable contre lui.\n[110] Le gend. McDonald a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lors de cette rencontre, le plaignant \u00e9tait en pleine forme et semblait avoir h\u00e2te de commencer la formation. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, ils ont patrouill\u00e9 ensemble et se sont bien entendus. Ils ont beaucoup ri. Le plaignant a racont\u00e9 que le gend. Haney s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 tr\u00e8s dur envers lui mais qu'en revanche, le gend. Carr avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un bon formateur. Au cours des deux premi\u00e8res semaines, le plaignant a affich\u00e9 une attitude positive et \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s motiv\u00e9. Le gend. McDonald a qualifi\u00e9 de routiniers les appels dont ils s'\u00e9taient occup\u00e9s au cours de cette s\u00e9rie de quarts de travail, tout en faisant remarquer que le plaignant s'\u00e9tait bien tir\u00e9 d'affaire. Il semblait bien r\u00e9agir au stress professionnel, en d\u00e9pit de la pression \u00e9vidente qu'il subissait.\n[111] Le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait content de ses deux premi\u00e8res semaines de formation sous la tutelle du gend. McDonald. Son aptitude \u00e0 r\u00e9diger des rapports ne faisait plus l'objet de critiques et ses activit\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9es. N\u00e9anmoins, la situation le stressait, d'autant plus que son formateur avait tendance \u00e0 prendre des notes lorsqu'il faisait la moindre erreur, et ce, m\u00eame dans des domaines o\u00f9 il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 comp\u00e9tent. Cela dit, il a per\u00e7u comme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement positives les deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9valuations hebdomadaires du gend. McDonald, et \u00e9tait optimiste. Pour sa part, le gend. McDonald faisait montre \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 d'un optimisme mod\u00e9r\u00e9, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait trop t\u00f4t pour tirer des conclusions finales. La semaine suivante allait \u00eatre une toute autre histoire.\nI. Deuxi\u00e8me prolongation de la formation pratique - Troisi\u00e8me semaine [112] Le 6 novembre 1997, le plaignant et le gend. McDonald ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9s \u00e0 un immeuble d'appartements o\u00f9 un homme avait, semble-t-il, prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des menaces de mort. Le gend. St-Fleur, qui \u00e9tait lui aussi une recrue \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, et son formateur, le gend. Marx, \u00e9taient \u00e9galement en patrouille dans le secteur. Ce sont eux qui sont arriv\u00e9s les premiers sur les lieux. Ils s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 entretenus avec la victime au moment o\u00f9 les autres les ont rejoints. Indiquant que cet incident serait pour les deux formateurs une bonne occasion d'\u00e9valuer les deux stagiaires, le gend. Marx a propos\u00e9 de laisser \u00e0 ces derniers le soin de s'occuper des enqu\u00eates et, s'il y a lieu, des arrestations. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, leur superviseur, le cap. Johnson, \u00e9tait lui aussi arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux. Il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de voir comment le plaignant r\u00e9agirait.\n[113] Avant de donner le feu vert aux recrues, le gend. McDonald a indiqu\u00e9 au plaignant que c'est lui qui serait responsable du cas, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'appel leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 initialement. Le plaignant en a d\u00e9duit qu'il avait le pouvoir de donner des ordres aux autres policiers sur les lieux. Il a inform\u00e9 ceux-ci de son plan. Compte tenu des renseignements d\u00e9j\u00e0 recueillis, il semblait y avoir mati\u00e8re \u00e0 arrestation. Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 l'ordre au gend. St-Fleur de prendre la d\u00e9position de la victime. Dans l'intervalle, le plaignant proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 l'arrestation du suspect avec l'aide du gend. McDonald ou du gend. Marx.\n[114] Au dire du plaignant, son plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 sans explication par les policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur pr\u00e9sents. On lui a dit qu'il ne pouvait confier au gend. St-Fleur la t\u00e2che de prendre la d\u00e9position ou de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'arrestation du suspect. Le plaignant \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 la confusion, car il avait compris qu'ils devaient s'occuper du dossier ensemble. Il a donc demand\u00e9 aux formateurs pourquoi ils rejetaient son approche. La discussion a d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 en dispute. Il pr\u00e9tend que le gend. McDonald s'est mis en col\u00e8re, qu'il l'a saisi par le bras et a point\u00e9 un doigt contre sa poitrine. Il aurait cri\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il \u00e9tait seulement une recrue et qu'il devrait faire exactement ce qu'on lui demandait. Le gend. Marx et le gend. St-Fleur ont ensuite quitt\u00e9, et le plaignant s'est occup\u00e9 seul du dossier.\n[115] Le gend. Marx, le gend. McDonald et le cap. Johnson ont consign\u00e9 leurs observations initiales au sujet de l'incident sur trois fiches de rendement 1004 distinctes. Leurs souvenirs diff\u00e8rent de ceux du plaignant. Ils pr\u00e9tendent qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au d\u00e9part que le plaignant serait responsable du dossier. Le gend. McDonald a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les instructions donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 celles que le plaignant avait re\u00e7ues jusqu'alors dans le cadre de sa formation. Elles impliquaient qu'il serait responsable de toute l'enqu\u00eate, y compris la paperasse et les enqu\u00eates compl\u00e9mentaires. La seule diff\u00e9rence dans ce cas-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait que le gend. St-Fleur \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de l'aider, au besoin. Le gend. St-Fleur avait, selon le gend. Marx, un r\u00f4le d'appui. Les quatre policiers, y compris le gend. St-Fleur, ont tous indiqu\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9s de voir le plaignant commencer \u00e0 donner des ordres, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 deux policiers plus haut grad\u00e9s, alors qu'on lui avait express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 de s'occuper lui-m\u00eame du dossier en pr\u00e9cisant que les trois membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur l'observeraient.\n[116] De plus, lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris \u00e0 part et qu'on lui a expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de quelle fa\u00e7on on voulait qu'il m\u00e8ne l'enqu\u00eate, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 argumenter et a fait la sourde oreille. Selon le cap. Johnson, il a r\u00e9agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9fensive, ent\u00eat\u00e9e et arrogante. Pis encore, le plaignant a adopt\u00e9 ce ton alors que le groupe \u00e9tait dans le hall d'entr\u00e9e de l'immeuble. Plusieurs badauds surveillaient la sc\u00e8ne. Le gend. Marx a remarqu\u00e9 que le plaignant semblait ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de comprendre le message que les autres tentaient de lui transmettre et de prendre une d\u00e9cision. Il \u00e9tait incapable de suivre une directive simple dans une situation \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Le gend. McDonald a d\u00e9crit la conduite du plaignant comme inacceptable et non professionnelle. Il s'inqui\u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement du fait que les formateurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents du plaignant avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 relev\u00e9 ce genre de comportement et en avaient discut\u00e9 avec lui. Le gend. St-Fleur n'a pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de rapport \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, mais il a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait pas la moindre id\u00e9e des raisons pour lesquelles son coll\u00e8gue recrue \u00e9tait incapable de comprendre les instructions qu'on lui donnait. \u00c0 ses yeux, les directives \u00e9taient claires. Le gend. St-Fleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a m\u00eame tent\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 de reformuler et d'expliquer les instructions en fran\u00e7ais, mais que le plaignant refusait de l'\u00e9couter.\n[117] L'incident a suscit\u00e9 dans l'esprit du cap. Johnson de s\u00e9rieux doutes quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du plaignant. Le plaignant semblait ne pas du tout savoir ce qu'il devait faire et, lorsqu'on lui a donn\u00e9 des directives, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas les suivre. Le cap. Johnson a qualifi\u00e9 de bl\u00e2mable le comportement du plaignant dans cette affaire tout en indiquant que son manque de jugement et son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient vraiment mati\u00e8re \u00e0 inqui\u00e9tude. Le cap. Johnson avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement d\u00e9rout\u00e9 par le comportement du plaignant qu'il avait perdu confiance dans la capacit\u00e9 de ce dernier [TRADUCTION] d'accomplir ses fonctions sans avoir quelqu'un qui regarde par-dessus son \u00e9paule. Dans la fiche de rendement qu'il a remplie, le cap. Johnson a conclu que si le plaignant continuait d'avoir un [TRADUCTION] rendement m\u00e9diocre, il \u00e9tait douteux qu'il puisse demeurer au service de la GRC.\n[118] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, le plaignant a re\u00e7u des copies des fiches de rendement n\u00e9gatives. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il s'est dit outr\u00e9 que ces trois policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur de la GRC aient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9diger trois rapports n\u00e9gatifs distincts au sujet de cet incident. Il s'agissait \u00e0 son avis d'une r\u00e9action excessive. En fait, la plupart des nombreux t\u00e9moins en l'esp\u00e8ce qui connaissaient la GRC \u00e0 un titre ou un autre ne se souvenaient pas d'avoir jamais vu un membre faire l'objet de trois fiches de rendement 1004 n\u00e9gatives pour un m\u00eame incident. Le plaignant est d'avis qu'un seul rapport n\u00e9gatif aurait suffi. Il soutient que les trois rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s afin de [TRADUCTION] l'\u00e9craser psychologiquement.\n[119] Les trois policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur ont tous indiqu\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils avaient chacun d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment d'\u00e9tablir une fiche de rendement 1004 n\u00e9gative au sujet de l'incident. Ils ne se sont pas consult\u00e9s avant ou pendant la r\u00e9daction de leur rapport. Le gend. McDonald pr\u00e9tend que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que trois policiers relativement exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s avaient observ\u00e9 la conduite d'un membre de rang inf\u00e9rieur dans un contexte de formation, et compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l'incident, il \u00e9tait usuel que chacun d'eux veuille consigner par \u00e9crit ses observations. Il nie avoir \u00e9lev\u00e9 la voix ou point\u00e9 son doigt contre la poitrine du plaignant.\n[120] Le plaignant s'est par la suite excus\u00e9 de son comportement aupr\u00e8s des trois membres; cependant, il a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses uniquement parce qu'il d\u00e9sirait maintenir de bonnes relations avec son formateur et son superviseur. Il soutient qu'il n'avait pas tort et que le probl\u00e8me d\u00e9coulait d'erreurs de communication.\n[121] Le plaignant a fait l'objet d'une autre fiche de rendement 1004 n\u00e9gative avant la fin de cette semaine-l\u00e0. Cette fiche avait trait \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui avaient d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 5 novembre 1997, soit le jour avant l'incident pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 des menaces de mort. Le plaignant avait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 une camionnette qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e dans un parc de stationnement de l'a\u00e9roport. Le v\u00e9hicule renfermait beaucoup de mat\u00e9riel de jardinage, notamment une tondeuse \u00e0 gazon, des g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices et du mat\u00e9riel motoris\u00e9. On ne savait pas \u00e0 qui appartenaient les biens. \u00c0 la demande du gend. McDonald, le plaignant a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un avis de biens r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s devant \u00eatre diffus\u00e9 au moyen de la banque nationale de donn\u00e9es de la police - CIPC. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'ils sont diffus\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale, ces avis doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9s par un superviseur. Le plaignant a donc soumis l'avis en question \u00e0 l'approbation du cap. Wesley Waters, qui \u00e9tait le surveillant de voirie affect\u00e9 au quart suivant. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au cap. Waters de mettre l'avis sur le tableau d'affichage utilis\u00e9 lors des breffages, ce qui signifiait qu'on demanderait \u00e0 tous les policiers se pr\u00e9sentant au travail d'\u00eatre \u00e0 l'aff\u00fbt de toute information concernant le vol de ces biens. Le cap. Waters a examin\u00e9 la liste des biens r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s et constat\u00e9 que beaucoup d'entre eux \u00e9taient fabriqu\u00e9s par Honda. Il savait d'exp\u00e9rience que le fabricant enregistrait les num\u00e9ros de s\u00e9rie pour ce genre de mat\u00e9riel et les noms des propri\u00e9taires et qu'il pourrait facilement indiquer au plaignant \u00e0 qui les biens appartenaient. Il n'\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de diffuser un avis ou d'\u00e9tablir un rapport destin\u00e9 au tableau d'affichage en vue de trouver qui \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des biens vol\u00e9s.\n[122] Le cap. Waters a cherch\u00e9 le num\u00e9ro de Honda Canada dans l'annuaire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et l'a donn\u00e9 au plaignant en lui conseillant de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 la compagnie le lendemain. Cependant, plut\u00f4t que de faire cet appel, le plaignant est all\u00e9 trouver un autre superviseur et lui a demand\u00e9 d'informer les autres \u00e9quipes, faisant fi des instructions que le cap. Waters lui avait donn\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[123] Le 11 novembre 1997, le cap. Waters a crois\u00e9 le plaignant, qui \u00e9tait venu au d\u00e9tachement alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9. Il s'est enquis aupr\u00e8s de la recrue du r\u00e9sultat de son appel chez Honda. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait pas encore pu faire l'appel parce qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cour toute la journ\u00e9e le 6 novembre. En fait, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le cap. Waters qu'il avait en tout \u00e9tat de cause diffus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale, par le biais du CIPC, un avis de biens r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s. Le cap. Waters s'est f\u00e2ch\u00e9. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il avait simplement \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Honda. Le cap. Waters s'inqui\u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que la victime du vol - sans doute un jardinier paysagiste - ait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de l'usage de son mat\u00e9riel pendant de nombreux jours et ait probablement perdu de l'argent \u00e0 cause de ce retard. Le lendemain, le cap. Waters a lui-m\u00eame t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de Honda. En l'espace de quelques minutes, il a obtenu le nom et l'adresse du propri\u00e9taire.\n[124] Le cap. Waters a reproch\u00e9 au plaignant dans une fiche de rendement 1004 de ne pas avoir tenu compte de l'avis d'un enqu\u00eateur plus haut grad\u00e9 et plus chevronn\u00e9, ce qui avait retard\u00e9 la remise des biens au propri\u00e9taire et entra\u00een\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate inutile (c.-\u00e0-d. l'avis national du CIPC).\n[125] Pour sa part, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre all\u00e9 trouver le cap. Waters surtout pour qu'il corrige les fautes d'orthographe dans son rapport sur les pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction. Par ailleurs, il n'y avait rien de mal, au dire du plaignant, \u00e0 demander \u00e0 l'autre surveillant de voirie d'informer les policiers affect\u00e9s au quart suivant de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des biens en question. Il s'agissait d'une pratique courante. Le lendemain, soit le 6 novembre, il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'appel concernant les menaces de mort, au cours duquel il s'est querell\u00e9 avec ses coll\u00e8gues de rang sup\u00e9rieur pr\u00e9sents. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de communiquer avec Honda en raison de cette situation. Le lendemain (vendredi 7 novembre), il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au quart de soir\u00e9e et les bureaux du fabricant \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9s lorsqu'il a tent\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner dans la soir\u00e9e. Par la suite, alors qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas de service, il s'\u00e9tait rendu au poste \u00e0 son troisi\u00e8me jour de cong\u00e9 (le 11) avec l'intention de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Honda.\n[126] Toutefois, il y a lieu de noter que l'appel du 6 novembre concernant les menaces de mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u \u00e0 la fin du quart de travail, apr\u00e8s 17 h. L'intim\u00e9e soutient que le plaignant a eu amplement l'occasion de communiquer avec Honda plus t\u00f4t ce jour-l\u00e0, mais qu'il a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment choisi de passer outre aux instructions du cap. Waters.\n[127] Le plaignant a fait remarquer que les biens ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus \u00e0 leur propri\u00e9taire le 13 novembre, soit un peu plus d'une semaine apr\u00e8s le vol. Il a soutenu qu'il s'agissait d'un d\u00e9lai tr\u00e8s court comparativement aux d\u00e9lais de plusieurs mois qui s'\u00e9coulent habituellement avant que des biens vol\u00e9s soient rendus \u00e0 leurs propri\u00e9taires l\u00e9gitimes. Il a \u00e9galement fait observer que le jardinier paysagiste \u00e9tait tellement content d'avoir r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 son mat\u00e9riel qu'il a offert un cadeau au plaignant en signe de gratitude. De l'avis du cap. Waters, ce dernier point n'est pas pertinent puisque le propri\u00e9taire ne savait tout simplement pas que ses biens auraient pu lui \u00eatre rendus plus rapidement si le plaignant avait suivi ses instructions initiales.\n[128] Dans le compte rendu sommaire d'activit\u00e9s de cette semaine-l\u00e0, le gend. McDonald a indiqu\u00e9 que la FPR du plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] moins que positive. Il a admis que le stagiaire subissait beaucoup de pression, ce qui n'\u00e9tait certes pas sans lui causer une certaine angoisse. Le gend. McDonald a ajout\u00e9 qu'il souhaitait ne pas s'attarder seulement aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9gatifs; par cons\u00e9quent, il a cit\u00e9 une couple de cas o\u00f9 le plaignant avait bien r\u00e9agi et bien tir\u00e9 son \u00e9pingle du jeu.\nJ. Deuxi\u00e8me prolongation de la formation pratique - Quatri\u00e8me semaine [129] La s\u00e9rie suivante de quarts de travail s'est \u00e9chelonn\u00e9e du 13 au 19 novembre 1997. Au dire du gend. McDonald, ce fut une semaine sans histoire au cours de laquelle les appels re\u00e7us \u00e9taient relativement routiniers et avaient exig\u00e9 un travail d'enqu\u00eate ou des suivis minimes. N\u00e9anmoins, le gend. McDonald a tout de m\u00eame relat\u00e9 trois incidents o\u00f9, selon lui, la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de prendre des d\u00e9cisions a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[130] Le premier incident avait trait \u00e0 un appel banal. Quelqu'un avait dit avoir vu deux hommes sortir d'un appartement avec un t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur qu'ils avaient mis dans une voiture. Le plaignant s'est rendu sur les lieux et a imprudemment gar\u00e9 la voiture de patrouille en plein milieu d'un arr\u00eat d'autobus alors que beaucoup d'espaces de stationnement \u00e9taient libres. Il a fallu que le gend. McDonald lui indique qu'il vaudrait mieux garer la voiture ailleurs. Dans les moments qui ont suivi, le plaignant et lui ont vu quelqu'un sortir de l'appartement. Le plaignant s'est approch\u00e9 de l'individu et lui a demand\u00e9 s'il r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 cet endroit. L'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. Le plaignant allait le laisser quitter les lieux dans sa voiture. Le gend. McDonald est intervenu et a rappel\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il fallait demander \u00e0 l'individu de s'identifier et de fournir de plus amples d\u00e9tails relativement \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[131] Apr\u00e8s que l'individu eut fourni au plaignant l'information demand\u00e9e, le gend. McDonald a d\u00fb intervenir au moment o\u00f9 ce dernier s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 monter dans la voiture de patrouille pour quitter les lieux. Il lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il restait \u00e0 faire. Le plaignant a sembl\u00e9 \u00eatre pris au d\u00e9pourvu; il a fallu que le formateur lui demande express\u00e9ment de trouver les occupants r\u00e9els de l'appartement et de leur parler, ce que le plaignant a finalement fait. On a ainsi pu \u00e9tablir qu'il s'agissait simplement d'un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Le gend. McDonald a reproch\u00e9 au plaignant son manque de sens commun dans l'ex\u00e9cution de cette [TRADUCTION] t\u00e2che polici\u00e8re des plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires. Il n'aurait pas d\u00fb avoir \u00e0 lui donner des instructions.\n[132] Le deuxi\u00e8me incident n\u00e9gatif attest\u00e9 qui est survenu cette semaine-l\u00e0 avait trait \u00e0 un mandat d'arrestation contre un jeune contrevenant que le plaignant et le gend. McDonald avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver. Le formateur a fait remarquer qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une t\u00e2che polici\u00e8re simple. Cependant, il a fallu qu'il demande au plaignant d'informer le service de police de Vancouver de leur activit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur des limites de la ville et de communiquer avec leur propre r\u00e9partiteur au moment de leur retour \u00e0 Burnaby. Cette derni\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e lors d'une op\u00e9ration minut\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9sente un certain risque. Si le r\u00e9partiteur ne re\u00e7oit pas de nouvelles des policiers dans le laps de temps indiqu\u00e9, il communique avec eux par radio pour leur demander si tout va bien.\n[133] D\u00e8s leur arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du jeune contrevenant, le plaignant a arr\u00eat\u00e9 l'adolescent de 14 ans; toutefois, il a fallu que le gend. McDonald lui rappelle d'aller informer la m\u00e8re de l'adolescent de ce qui se passait. Dans son rapport, le gend. McDonald a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une des \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9vues dans la proc\u00e9dure op\u00e9rationnelle normale et qu'un membre ayant 12 mois d'exp\u00e9rience aurait d\u00fb avoir le r\u00e9flexe de faire cela.\n[134] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a exprim\u00e9 sa frustration \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce bl\u00e2me. Comme la m\u00e8re ne parlait pas anglais, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la sur de dix ans du jeune contrevenant d'expliquer la situation \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Le jeune contrevenant lui-m\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 que sa m\u00e8re comprenait. Le gend. McDonald a refus\u00e9 d'accepter l'explication du plaignant voulant qu'il ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 inform\u00e9 la m\u00e8re.\n[135] Le dernier incident attest\u00e9 qui est survenu cette semaine-l\u00e0 avait rapport \u00e0 un appel d'un chauffeur de taxi qui s'\u00e9tait plaint qu'une adolescente de 14 ans avait refus\u00e9 de payer une course et l'avait menac\u00e9 au moyen d'un couteau. Le plaignant et le gend. McDonald ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les premiers \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9s sur les lieux. Le gend. Marx, le gend. St-Fleur et le cap. Johnson ont eux aussi r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'appel. \u00c0 titre d'intervenant primaire, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de s'occuper du dossier. Il s'est entretenu quelques minutes avec le chauffeur pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit. Il s'est ensuite rendu \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l'adolescente, \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de laquelle cette derni\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait engouffr\u00e9e \u00e0 sa sortie de la voiture taxi. Le gend. McDonald pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant l'a aussit\u00f4t appr\u00e9hend\u00e9e, l'a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, lui a pass\u00e9 les menottes et l'a install\u00e9e sur la banquette arri\u00e8re de la voiture de police.\n[136] Le gend. McDonald a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre en doute dans une optique constructive la d\u00e9cision que venait de prendre le plaignant. Il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que la recrue avait r\u00e9agi apr\u00e8s n'avoir entendu qu'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la m\u00e9daille. Il a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il avait recueilli la version de l'adolescente avant de l'appr\u00e9hender. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative et est retourn\u00e9, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la voiture pour faire confirmer par elle l'infraction. Sa version \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle du chauffeur. Elle avait dit \u00e0 ce dernier qu'elle irait dans la maison faire des arrangements en vue de r\u00e9gler la course parce qu'elle n'avait pas d'argent sur elle. Comme il ne voulait pas qu'elle parte sans payer, le chauffeur de taxi l'a pourchass\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 la maison puis a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 crier et \u00e0 frapper sur la porte. Elle \u00e9tait effray\u00e9e et a saisi un couteau de cuisine qu'elle lui a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la fen\u00eatre pour lui faire peur. Comme l'a indiqu\u00e9 le gend. St-Fleur dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle n'avait pas l'intention de blesser le chauffeur. Elle voulait simplement qu'il parte. Elle lui avait montr\u00e9 le couteau \u00e0 travers la fen\u00eatre pour le faire reculer et se d\u00e9fendre.\n[137] Le plaignant est ensuite retourn\u00e9 voir le gend. McDonald pour lui raconter la version de l'adolescente. Le gend. McDonald lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau quelle d\u00e9cision il devrait prendre. Le plaignant n'ayant pas r\u00e9pondu, le cap. Johnson est intervenu pour demander \u00e0 nouveau qu'elle allait \u00eatre sa d\u00e9cision. Le gend. McDonald a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le plaignant ne semblait pas s\u00fbr. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s que les autres lui aient indiqu\u00e9 que le chauffeur de taxi n'avait pas divulgu\u00e9 tous les faits et qu'il n'y avait pas vraiment eu d'infraction, que le plaignant a r\u00e9agi en rel\u00e2chant l'adolescente. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. McDonald a indiqu\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait finalement la bonne, mais qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de la prendre lui-m\u00eame. Il avait fallu lui poser des questions incitatives ou mettre en doute son jugement dans une optique constructive. Le gend. McDonald n'est pas persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant aurait fait par lui-m\u00eame le bon choix.\n[138] Pour sa part, le plaignant conteste la fa\u00e7on dont le gend. McDonald a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les faits. Lors de sa conversation initiale avec le chauffeur, ce dernier lui a dit que l'adolescente lui avait mis un couteau sur la gorge et l'avait menac\u00e9. Le plaignant estimait avoir suffisamment d'information pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'arrestation. Il s'\u00e9tait entretenu avec l'adolescente et avait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'elle mentait. Il l'avait ensuite arr\u00eat\u00e9e afin qu'elle soit sous observation et pour faire enqu\u00eate.\n[139] Pendant qu'il conversait avec l'adolescente, les autres policiers avaient eu l'occasion de parler au chauffeur et de se rendre compte qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 certains faits de mani\u00e8re inexacte. Ils disposaient donc de renseignements que n'avait pas le plaignant et \u00e9taient mieux plac\u00e9s que lui pour savoir qu'une arrestation n'\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu'on ne lui a pas pos\u00e9 de questions incitatives et que son jugement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question de fa\u00e7on constructive lorsqu'il a rejoint les autres policiers \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. Ils l'ont plut\u00f4t encercl\u00e9 et l'ont confront\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on agressive. Ces derniers ne lui ont pas fait part des renseignements qu'ils venaient d'apprendre et ont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment choisi de jouer avec lui et de le contraindre \u00e0 tenter de d\u00e9fendre sa d\u00e9cision. On l'a fait sentir comme un imb\u00e9cile. Les questions n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es sur un ton poli. Les autres lui ont cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s, particuli\u00e8rement le cap. Johnson, qui a hurl\u00e9 que tout le monde attendait qu'il prenne [TRADUCTION] d\u00e8s maintenant sa d\u00e9cision et qu'il leur dise ce qu'il entendait faire. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que l'affaire a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e parce qu'il a r\u00e9ussi, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses talents de n\u00e9gociateur, \u00e0 convaincre le chauffeur de ne pas d\u00e9poser d'accusations.\n[140] Le gend. McDonald et le cap. Johnson nient avoir \u00e9lev\u00e9 la voix et insistent sur le fait qu'ils voulaient simplement \u00e9valuer la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de prendre des d\u00e9cisions.\nK. Deuxi\u00e8me prolongation de la formation pratique - Cinqui\u00e8me et sixi\u00e8me semaines [141] La s\u00e9rie suivante de quarts de travail a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 21 novembre 1997. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, le gend. McDonald a fait \u00e9quipe avec le plaignant pendant seulement deux jours. Le rapport portant la p\u00e9riode en question r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] relativement routiniers et qu'il s'agissait de quarts de travail [TRADUCTION] relativement sans histoire. N\u00e9anmoins, le gend. McDonald a relat\u00e9 deux incidents o\u00f9 le plaignant a bien tir\u00e9 son \u00e9pingle du jeu. Dans un des cas, il a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'arrestation d'un suspect. \u00c0 cette occasion, il a \u00e9tabli une bonne relation avec l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, ce qui a permis d'entrevoir la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il devienne un futur informateur de la police. Dans l'autre cas, le plaignant et le gend. McDonald ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9s sur les lieux d'un vol par effraction. Le plaignant s'est dirig\u00e9 vers le dernier endroit o\u00f9 l'on avait vu le suspect. Il l'a vite retrouv\u00e9 et arr\u00eat\u00e9. Il s'agissait d'un criminel de carri\u00e8re. Le gend. McDonald a f\u00e9licit\u00e9 le plaignant d'avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 mettre l'individu hors circuit pendant un certain temps. Le gend. McDonald a conclu le rapport par une phrase que le plaignant a trouv\u00e9 fort encourageante : [TRADUCTION] Ce fut une semaine tr\u00e8s positive pour le gend. Morin; il est \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que cela deviendra la norme plut\u00f4t que l'exception.\n[142] Au cours des jours qui ont suivi, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par le d\u00e9tachement au sommet de l'APEC (Organisation de coop\u00e9ration \u00e9conomique Asie-Pacifique), qui se d\u00e9roulait dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les participants \u00e0 ce sommet \u00e9taient des chef d'\u00c9tat et d'autres dignitaires provenant du monde entier, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 rev\u00eatait une importance cruciale. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 de faction surtout au dernier point de contr\u00f4le de s\u00fbret\u00e9, qui donnait acc\u00e8s au site de l'Universit\u00e9 Simon Fraser o\u00f9 se tenaient certaines r\u00e9unions. Toutes les personnes qui participaient \u00e0 ces r\u00e9unions devaient se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce point de contr\u00f4le de s\u00fbret\u00e9, apr\u00e8s en avoir franchi plusieurs autres. La t\u00e2che du plaignant consistait \u00e0 faire stopper les v\u00e9hicules, \u00e0 examiner les laissez-passer de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers et \u00e0 transmettre par radio au poste de commandement les renseignements pertinents. Une fois les papiers d'identit\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s, il pouvait laisser entrer le v\u00e9hicule.\n[143] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait crucial pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit. Le risque \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rable et il existait une menace \u00e9ventuelle. En cas de tentative pour franchir la barricade sans autorisation, le plaignant devait r\u00e9agir instinctivement et prendre rapidement une d\u00e9cision. Il pouvait m\u00eame \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se servir de son arme \u00e0 feu. Le plaignant a per\u00e7u cette affectation comme une indication de l'\u00e9valuation positive de son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions et comme la confirmation de ses comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 titre de policier. Pourquoi l'aurait-on affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste comportant d'aussi grandes responsabilit\u00e9s s'il n'avait pas encore atteint le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis?\n[144] Au dire de la GRC, la r\u00e9ponse est que l'hypoth\u00e8se du plaignant n'est pas fond\u00e9e. L'affectation en question ne comportait pas autant de responsabilit\u00e9s que ce qu'il a laiss\u00e9 entendre. Il s'agissait du dernier d'une s\u00e9rie de points de contr\u00f4le de s\u00fbret\u00e9, et il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fort peu probable qu'une personne non autoris\u00e9e ait pu parvenir jusque l\u00e0. En outre, le poste n'exigeait gu\u00e8re de prendre des d\u00e9cisions. La d\u00e9cision de donner ou de refuser l'acc\u00e8s \u00e9tait prise au poste de commandement et non par le plaignant. Les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 la circulation automobile et les fonctions de bas niveau en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont habituellement confi\u00e9es aux membres les moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s.\n[145] L'insp. Schlecker a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsque la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale lui a donn\u00e9 l'ordre d'affecter un certain nombre de policiers au sommet de l'APEC, il a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments les plus faibles de son d\u00e9tachement, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 il fallait avoir une expertise particuli\u00e8re. Burnaby \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement occup\u00e9 qui manquait d\u00e9j\u00e0 de personnel et o\u00f9 il devait garder le plus de comp\u00e9tences possible. Il ne pouvait se permettre d'affecter ses meilleurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de v\u00e9rification de cartes et de post-visionnage. Compte tenu des rapports qu'il avait re\u00e7us, l'insp. Schlecker nourrissait alors certaines inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des comp\u00e9tences polici\u00e8res du plaignant, se demandant m\u00eame s'il ne constituait pas un danger pour lui-m\u00eame et les autres. Cela ne l'a tout de m\u00eame pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de l'affecter \u00e0 des fonctions s\u00e9dentaires au point de contr\u00f4le de s\u00fbret\u00e9 lors du sommet. Les zones o\u00f9 il risquait d'y avoir du grabuge \u00e9taient sous la surveillance de groupes sp\u00e9ciaux tels que les escouades anti-\u00e9meute et les groupes d'armes sp\u00e9ciales et tactiques.\n[146] Rien dans la preuve n'indique que des membres de rang plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la GRC qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ou dont les noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience aient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s au sommet de l'APEC. Selon la preuve, il y a seulement trois policiers du d\u00e9tachement qui y ont particip\u00e9 : le gend. Louis Ma, qui venait tout juste de terminer sa FPR cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 et qui faisait \u00e9quipe avec le plaignant au point de contr\u00f4le de s\u00fbret\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le gend. St-Fleur, dont la FPR \u00e9tait en cours \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d'ouvrir les porti\u00e8res des voitures transportant les dignitaires, et le plaignant.\n[147] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. McDonald a affirm\u00e9 que, pendant l'affectation du plaignant au sommet de l'APEC (cinqui\u00e8me et sixi\u00e8me semaines de la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode de prolongation de sa formation), il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont se d\u00e9roulait la FPR et \u00e0 se demander si le plaignant allait finalement r\u00e9ussir. Il a conclu qu'il \u00e9tait peu probable que certains probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions puissent se r\u00e9soudre dans les semaines restantes. Entre autres probl\u00e8mes, le gend. McDonald a mentionn\u00e9 la tendance du plaignant \u00e0 porter rapidement un jugement sans avoir suffisamment d'information, le fait qu'il ne tenait pas compte des conseils des autres, sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses mauvaises d\u00e9cisions et son manque de sens commun. Le plaignant avait dit au gend. McDonald que s'il ne r\u00e9ussissait pas, il avait l'intention de retourner au Qu\u00e9bec et de postuler un emploi aupr\u00e8s d'un autre corps policier. Le gend. McDonald savait que si le plaignant pr\u00e9sentait encore \u00e0 la fin de sa FPR des lacunes relativement \u00e0 l'un des crit\u00e8res, celui-ci serait lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de la GRC. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il serait stigmatis\u00e9 et cela nuirait \u00e0 ses recherches pour trouver un emploi dans le domaine policier. De plus, s'il devait \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de deux mois, ce serait malheureusement juste avant No\u00ebl.\n[148] Le gend. McDonald pr\u00e9tend avoir discut\u00e9 avec le cap. Johnson et le serg. Ross et propos\u00e9, par esprit de compassion, qu'on offre sans tarder au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner. Cela lui donnerait la chance de rassembler ses effets personnels et d'organiser son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al avant No\u00ebl; son dossier r\u00e9v\u00e9lerait simplement qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de la GRC pendant un an et qu'il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 pour chercher un emploi ailleurs. Rien n'indiquerait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Le cap. Johnson \u00e9tait favorable \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e, mais il devait obtenir l'approbation de la haute direction pour y donner suite. L'insp. Schlecker a donn\u00e9 le feu vert peu de temps apr\u00e8s.\n[149] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la matin\u00e9e du 30 novembre 1997, au d\u00e9but du premier quart de travail du plaignant apr\u00e8s son retour du sommet de l'APEC, le gend. McDonald et le cap. Johnson ont invit\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 venir prendre le petit d\u00e9jeuner avec eux dans un restaurant de l'endroit. Le gend. McDonald a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'entretien avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cordial et qu'il avait d\u00e9crit les c\u00f4t\u00e9s positifs du plaignant ainsi que les aspects probl\u00e9matiques. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il ne serait pas, \u00e0 son avis, en mesure de rem\u00e9dier aux probl\u00e8mes au cours des semaines qui restaient. Par cons\u00e9quent, il lui a offert la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner sur-le-champ. Le gend. McDonald all\u00e8gue qu'il a clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 poursuivre sa formation jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de deux mois, si tel \u00e9tait son souhait.\n[150] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 outr\u00e9 par la proposition. Il estimait qu'il venait d'avoir deux tr\u00e8s bonnes semaines. Il avait trouv\u00e9 encourageante sa derni\u00e8re fiche de rendement, dans laquelle le gend. McDonald disait souhaiter que son bon travail deviendrait la norme. Cela ne donnait gu\u00e8re \u00e0 penser qu'il serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment. Son affectation au sommet de l'APEC lui avait donn\u00e9 d'autres raisons d'\u00eatre optimiste.\n[151] Apr\u00e8s le petit d\u00e9jeuner, tout le monde est retourn\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement et le plaignant a pris un certain temps pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision. Apr\u00e8s moins d'une heure, le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le gend. McDonald qu'il allait exercer son option de d\u00e9missionner de la GRC. Plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, le plaignant et le gend. McDonald se sont rencontr\u00e9s pour discuter du rapport final d'\u00e9valuation, dans lequel il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 qu'il y avait encore des progr\u00e8s \u00e0 faire relativement au seul crit\u00e8re de la prise de d\u00e9cisions. Le formateur a annex\u00e9 au rapport un texte de trois pages dans lequel il faisait \u00e9tat de quatre motifs \u00e0 l'appui de ce constat : la tendance du plaignant \u00e0 porter rapidement un jugement et \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions sans avoir suffisamment d'information; le fait qu'il ne tenait pas compte des conseils et des instructions d'enqu\u00eateurs de rang sup\u00e9rieur; sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses mauvaises d\u00e9cisions; et son absence de sens commun. Le gend. McDonald fournissait des d\u00e9tails au sujet de certains incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans ses fiches de rendement hebdomadaires pour illustrer les probl\u00e8mes, notamment l'appel du 6 novembre concernant les menaces de mort, l'arrestation de l'adolescente qui n'avait pas pay\u00e9 sa course en taxi et l'affaire du mat\u00e9riel Honda vol\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[152] Le lendemain, l'insp. Schlecker a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant et lui a demand\u00e9 de lui remettre son arme et son insigne. Ils ont discut\u00e9 de certains incidents d\u00e9crits dans le rapport du gend. McDonald. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'il a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau de donner sa version, mais que l'insp. Schlecker a fait la sourde oreille. La d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 prise. L'insp. Schlecker lui a dit qu'il avait voulu durant sa jeunesse apprendre le violon, mais qu'il s'\u00e9tait rendu compte qu'il n'avait tout simplement pas le talent n\u00e9cessaire. De m\u00eame, le plaignant n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas fait pour \u00eatre policier au sein de la GRC. Lorsqu'il est sorti de cette rencontre, le plaignant \u00e9tait an\u00e9anti. Son r\u00eave s'\u00e9tait \u00e9vanoui. Ce soir-l\u00e0, plusieurs coll\u00e8gues de travail sont venus chez lui. Ce fut un moment tr\u00e8s \u00e9mouvant pour tout le monde.\n[153] Ce jour-l\u00e0, le plaignant a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement ses propres observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rapport final d'\u00e9valuation. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fier d'avoir eu la chance de recevoir la [TRADUCTION] meilleure formation polici\u00e8re au Canada. Il remerciait tous ses coll\u00e8gues, superviseurs et sup\u00e9rieurs de leur appui. Il disait ne pas regretter son [TRADUCTION] aventure dans la police mont\u00e9e et d'avoir [TRADUCTION] travaill\u00e9 avec les meilleurs. Il disait avoir bon espoir que cela lui ouvrirait [TRADUCTION] des portes \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[154] N\u00e9anmoins, \u00e0 l'audience, le plaignant a soulign\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rapport final. Il a dit qu'une fois de plus, aucun exemple de ses r\u00e9alisations louables durant cette p\u00e9riode n'\u00e9tait donn\u00e9 dans le rapport final, bien que celles-ci aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es dans les fiches de rendement hebdomadaires. En outre, il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent de la part de son formateur et d'autres policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur tout au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, notamment lors de la querelle qui avait \u00e9clat\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion de l'incident du 6 novembre concernant les menaces de mort, sans parler de l'\u00e9tablissement subs\u00e9quent non pas d'une mais bien de trois fiches de rendement n\u00e9gatives. \u00c0 son avis, il avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on injuste lorsqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 encercl\u00e9 par les autres policiers lors de l'incident de la course en taxi impay\u00e9e. Fait plus important, le plaignant a accus\u00e9 le gend. McDonald d'avoir affich\u00e9 un comportement d\u00e9notant des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux \u00e0 son endroit et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres personnes de race noire. Il a donn\u00e9 trois exemples.\n[155] Le premier a trait \u00e0 un dessin que le gend. McDonald aurait fait un jour o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait derri\u00e8re le volant de leur voiture de patrouille qui \u00e9tait gar\u00e9e. Le gend. St-Fleur et son formateur, le gend. Marx, \u00e9taient assis dans un v\u00e9hicule qui se trouvait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le gend. McDonald a pris une feuille de papier et a dessin\u00e9 un portrait du gend. St-Fleur, qui est lui aussi de race noire et d'origine ha\u00eftienne. La taille de son nez et de ses l\u00e8vres \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9e sur le dessin. Le gend. McDonald a ensuite dit en riant que le nez et les l\u00e8vres du plaignant \u00e9taient plus petits que ceux du gend. St-Fleur. Le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9agi ouvertement. Il n'a pas non plus souffl\u00e9 mot de cet incident au gend. St-Fleur. Cependant, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'int\u00e9rieurement, il avait trouv\u00e9 cela stupide et raciste.\n[156] Le gend. McDonald a carr\u00e9ment ni\u00e9 que cet incident se soit jamais produit. Le plaignant n'a pas fait mention de ce dessin dans sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne. Il n'a jamais racont\u00e9 l'incident, pas plus qu'il ne s'en est plaint \u00e0 qui que ce soit au sein de la GRC. La premi\u00e8re r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un dessin figure dans les documents divulgu\u00e9s par le plaignant, c'est-\u00e0-dire dans l'expos\u00e9 des faits essentiels de la plainte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant le Tribunal en f\u00e9vrier 2003. Fait curieux, selon l'expos\u00e9, c'est \u00e0 l'automne de 1996, et non de 1997, que le plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de la sc\u00e8ne du dessin raciste; l'artiste \u00e9tait le gend. Haney et la personne dessin\u00e9e, le gend. Albert. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission du dessin lorsqu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait eu un flash peu de temps avant l'audience et qu'il s'\u00e9tait rappel\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait le gend. McDonald, et non le gend. Haney, qui avait fait le portrait du gend. St-Fleur, et non du gend. Albert. Il a termin\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point en r\u00e9p\u00e9tant que l'auteur du dessin \u00e9tait le gend. McDonald et en disant : Je ne veux pas rajouter autre chose au constable Haney, c'est assez..\n[157] Le deuxi\u00e8me cas de discrimination raciale cit\u00e9 par le plaignant se serait produit dans un restaurant-minute o\u00f9 il s'\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour prendre un caf\u00e9 en compagnie du gend. McDonald et de plusieurs autres policiers durant leur quart de travail. Le gend. St-Fleur a dit au gend. McDonald que sa cravate \u00e9tait sale, ce \u00e0 quoi ce dernier aurait r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Qui a l'air le plus sale? Vous ou moi? Le plaignant se souvient que les bottines du gend. St-Fleur \u00e9taient reluisantes, que sa chemise \u00e9tait bien press\u00e9e et que sa tenue en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tait impeccable. En fait, le gend. St-Fleur avait la r\u00e9putation d'\u00eatre une personne tir\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre \u00e9pingles; dans les rapports d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tablis pendant sa formation pratique, on lui avait attribu\u00e9 une note sup\u00e9rieure pour ce qui est de la tenue et du maintien. Le plaignant ne pouvait que conclure que la remarque du gend. McDonald \u00e9tait une allusion \u00e0 la couleur de la peau du gend. St-Fleur. La remarque a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en pr\u00e9sence du cap. Johnson, qui n'a r\u00e9agi en aucune fa\u00e7on. Le plaignant jugeait cet incident d\u00e9gradant et humiliant. Il s'agissait, selon lui, d'une forme directe de racisme. Le plaignant n'a pas fait mention non plus de cet incident dans la plainte qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne.\n[158] Le gend. McDonald nie avoir jamais fait cette remarque. Pour sa part, le gend. St-Fleur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il s'en souvenait vaguement. Il se rappelle que son gilet pare-balles \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s sale ce jour-l\u00e0. Il a pens\u00e9 que la remarque du gend. McDonald s'appliquait \u00e0 son gilet, comme s'il avait voulu dire : [TRADUCTION] Quel uniforme est le plus sale? Le tien ou le mien? Le gend. St-Fleur avait examin\u00e9 son gilet et constat\u00e9 que la remarque du gend. McDonald \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Le gend. St-Fleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de voir ensuite le plaignant s'approcher de lui, l'air choqu\u00e9, pour se plaindre de la remarque. Le gend. St-Fleur lui a alors demand\u00e9 c'\u00e9tait quoi l'affaire?. Il a dit croire que le plaignant ne connaissait simplement pas le contexte de la conversation. Il s'agissait d'une m\u00e9prise raisonnable de sa part, mais tout de m\u00eame d'une m\u00e9prise.\n[159] Le troisi\u00e8me incident o\u00f9 le gend. McDonald aurait fait montre, selon le plaignant, d'insensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes de couleur a rapport \u00e0 une discussion qu'ils auraient eue tous les deux en compagnie du gend. St-Fleur au sujet du programme d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi de la GRC. Le gend. McDonald a affirm\u00e9 que les personnes de race noire et les membres d'autres groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e9taient embauch\u00e9es de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux Blancs. Selon lui, c'\u00e9tait de la discrimination \u00e0 rebours. Le plaignant et le gend. St-Fleur ont r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que ces mesures \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la sous-repr\u00e9sentation de ces groupes au sein de la GRC. Le plaignant a admis que cet \u00e9change s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 sur un ton professionnel, mais les croyances du gend. McDonald constituent \u00e0 son avis la preuve que ce dernier ne comprenait pas l'ampleur des probl\u00e8mes auxquels font face les personnes de race noire dans la GRC. Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait blessant d'\u00eatre t\u00e9moin d'un tel manque de compr\u00e9hension.\n[160] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. McDonald a dit se souvenir de cette conversation. Elle portait sur les examens d'entr\u00e9e des personnes postulant un emploi dans la GRC. Le nombre de points n\u00e9cessaires pour passer au niveau d'\u00e9valuation suivant \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour les hommes de race blanche que pour les membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9bat avait gravit\u00e9 autour du caract\u00e8re \u00e9quitable de ce syst\u00e8me et particuli\u00e8rement sur le fait que les examens \u00e9taient unidimensionnels et que des personnes qui auraient pu faire des policiers comp\u00e9tents risquaient d'\u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9es. Le gend. McDonald a pr\u00e9tendu avoir lui-m\u00eame fait remarquer au cours de la conversation que certains groupes avaient traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la GRC. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les trois ont tous ri du fait qu'il devait obtenir une meilleure note que les deux autres, mais il soutient qu'il n'a jamais exprim\u00e9 d'opinion n\u00e9gative \u00e0 ce sujet, si ce n'est qu'il esp\u00e9rait qu'on s\u00e9lectionnait en bout de ligne les personnes les plus comp\u00e9tentes. Selon le gend. McDonald, ce fut une [TRADUCTION] conversation constructive.\n[161] En outre, le plaignant a soutenu que l'insp. Schlecker, l'officier responsable des op\u00e9rations, a fait des d\u00e9clarations offensantes et d\u00e9plac\u00e9es \u00e0 propos des minorit\u00e9s visibles. En d\u00e9cembre 1998, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 par la GRC de commenter la plainte actuelle et dans laquelle le plaignant all\u00e9guait avoir fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent en raison de sa couleur. L'insp. Schlecker a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note dans laquelle il a affirm\u00e9 que jusqu'au moment de l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission sur la plainte, il [TRADUCTION] ne savait pas que le gend. Morin \u00e9tait une personne de couleur (...was coloured), tout en pr\u00e9cisant : [TRADUCTION] Comme moi, il a un teint fonc\u00e9; je croyais qu'il \u00e9tait lui aussi de descendance europ\u00e9enne. Pri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de commenter ces remarques, l'insp. Schlecker a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'on m'informe qu'il se consid\u00e9rait comme \u00e9tant de race noire, je n'ai vraiment jamais pens\u00e9 que le gend. Morin \u00e9tait un Noir. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage :\n[TRADUCTION] Il [le plaignant] me rappelle un ami intime du nom de [...], qui est Hongrois. Il pourrait presque \u00eatre son fr\u00e8re jumeau. Lorsque je regarde le gend. Morin, je ne le consid\u00e8re jamais comme un Noir. Il [le plaignant] me dit qu'il est de race noire. Je crois cela et puis lorsque je le regarde, je peux dire : Oui, je peux voir qu'il y a de cela en vous. Mais, si on ne me l'avait pas dit, cela ne me serait pas apparu \u00e9vident.\n[162] Le plaignant a soulign\u00e9 que dans plusieurs documents de la GRC, notamment dans la formule que la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t a fait parvenir \u00e0 Burnaby pour informer le d\u00e9tachement de son arriv\u00e9e imminente en vue de sa formation, il est clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il est un homme de race noire d'origine ha\u00eftienne.\n[163] Dans sa note de service, l'insp. Schlecker affirmait \u00e9galement qu'au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, [TRADUCTION] le m\u00e9lange de personnes de couleur (coloured), de personnes de diff\u00e9rentes ethnies et de femmes \u00e9tait proportionnellement beaucoup plus prononc\u00e9 en raison du roulement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de recrues et du d\u00e9sir de la direction d'\u00eatre le miroir de la collectivit\u00e9 de Burnaby. Interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience quant \u00e0 l'emploi qu'il avait fait de l'expression de couleur, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait pos\u00e9 la question suivante \u00e0 un ami de race noire qu'il avait en Saskatchewan : [TRADUCTION] Comment vous d\u00e9finiriez-vous? L'ami lui a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Bien, comme \u00e9tant de couleur. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque l'insp. Schlecker a employ\u00e9 le terme dans sa note de service, il n'a pas estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait offensant. Le plaignant soutient qu'il s'agit, au contraire, d'un terme offensant et m\u00e9prisant du fait qu'il \u00e9voque l'esclavage et la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation dans le vieux sud des \u00c9tats-Unis. Le plaignant a soulign\u00e9 qu'il faut faire une importante distinction entre le terme employ\u00e9 par l'insp. Schlecker et le terme personne de couleur (person of colour), qui est de plus en plus utilis\u00e9 de nos jours de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'expression membre d'un groupe de minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[164] \u00c0 propos de la remarque au sujet de la population de Burnaby qui \u00e9tait \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans sa note, l'insp. Schlecker a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de d\u00e9crire la composition de cette ville. Il a affirm\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] ce que nous consid\u00e9rons le Canadien moyen de race blanche, d'origine europ\u00e9enne est en voie de devenir pour ainsi dire une minorit\u00e9 dans certaines r\u00e9gions des basses terres du Fraser [en Colombie-Britannique] (italique ajout\u00e9).\nL. Retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al [165] Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9mission du plaignant, ce dernier et sa fianc\u00e9e, Mme Cerrato, ont commenc\u00e9 aussit\u00f4t \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer leur retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Le couple a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 les services de d\u00e9m\u00e9nageurs, emball\u00e9 ses choses, r\u00e9sili\u00e9 son bail et communiqu\u00e9 avec les entreprises d'utilit\u00e9 publique. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, aucun officier sup\u00e9rieur du d\u00e9tachement n'a pris contact avec le plaignant pour voir comment il se d\u00e9brouillait ou pour lui offrir un soutien logistique quelconque. Une somme de 1 500 $ lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour couvrir certains frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. En outre, le plaignant a re\u00e7u sa solde \u00e0 titre de membre jusqu'\u00e0 la mi-janvier 1998. Malgr\u00e9 tout, il n'a eu d'autre choix que d'utiliser toutes ses \u00e9conomies et sa carte de cr\u00e9dit pour payer les frais. Afin de r\u00e9duire au minimum ses d\u00e9penses, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de laisser \u00e0 Burnaby une partie de ses meubles et autres biens plut\u00f4t que de payer pour les faire transporter jusqu'au Qu\u00e9bec.\n[166] Le couple est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en voiture, apr\u00e8s six jours de voyage au cours desquels ils ont essuy\u00e9 des temp\u00eates, ont presque eu un accident et ont d\u00fb faire r\u00e9parer leur v\u00e9hicule qui \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 en panne. Ce fut un cauchemar. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9prim\u00e9 pendant tout le voyage.\n[167] \u00c0 son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le plaignant a postul\u00e9 un emploi aupr\u00e8s de plusieurs corps de police du Qu\u00e9bec. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 municipale de la ville de Laval, qui l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il fallait avoir un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales ou universitaires dans une discipline li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 polici\u00e8re pour franchir l'\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Il a \u00e9galement transmis une demande \u00e0 la S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. Il a r\u00e9ussi les examens d'aptitudes physiques et de conduite automobile, mais il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi l'entrevue pour des motifs dont on ne lui a jamais fait part. Il a soumis une demande \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 municipale de Brossard, qui ne lui a jamais donn\u00e9 de nouvelles. Apr\u00e8s qu'il eut postul\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 municipale de l'\u00cele-Perrot, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 subir un examen. Il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 cet examen en raison de sa m\u00e9connaissance des lois provinciales du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[168] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1997, le plaignant a postul\u00e9 un emploi de policier aupr\u00e8s du Service de police de la Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al (SPCUM). Dans sa demande, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter la GRC parce qu'il d\u00e9sirait travailler dans sa province natale, pr\u00e8s de sa famille, en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais. Il n'a aucunement mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 formellement ou de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9guis\u00e9e. Le SPCUM s'\u00e9tait dot\u00e9 d'un programme d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi afin de favoriser le recrutement de membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Conform\u00e9ment au programme, le plaignant a rempli un questionnaire dans lequel il s'est identifi\u00e9 comme membre d'une minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[169] Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi le test d'aptitudes physiques, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 par un comit\u00e9 form\u00e9 de deux membres, dont Suzanne Lachance. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, cette derni\u00e8re a affirm\u00e9 que l'entrevue avait dur\u00e9 environ une heure et demie. Le plaignant a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 sur un certain nombre de sujets : maturit\u00e9, qualit\u00e9s interpersonnelles, confiance en soi, tol\u00e9rance au stress. En outre, le comit\u00e9 lui a pos\u00e9 des questions sur trois sc\u00e9narios d'intervention polici\u00e8re visant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer sa capacit\u00e9 d'analyse et son aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le comit\u00e9 lui a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 un score de 54,82 %. Il lui fallait obtenir un score d'au moins 60 % pour qu'il fasse l'objet d'une recommandation en vue de l'obtention d'un poste de policier.\n[170] Le comit\u00e9 a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport \u00e0 la suite de l'entrevue. Le plaignant n'avait obtenu que 47 points sur une possibilit\u00e9 de 90 pour ce qui est des sc\u00e9narios. Le comit\u00e9 a fait remarquer qu'il avait affich\u00e9 une certaine rigidit\u00e9 dans chacun des cas. Il appliquait les lois et r\u00e8glements \u00e0 la lettre et n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s ouvert \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que ses d\u00e9cisions puissent \u00eatre remises en question. En ce qui concerne les sc\u00e9narios qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, les membres du comit\u00e9 se sont inqui\u00e9t\u00e9s du fait qu'il ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de passer outre \u00e0 l'avis d'un coll\u00e8gue policier. Dans un autre cas, le comit\u00e9 a trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 redire \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision d'appr\u00e9hender des jeunes tr\u00e8s rapidement, sans songer aux cons\u00e9quences. Par ailleurs, les membres du comit\u00e9 ont d\u00e9cel\u00e9 une certaine impatience dans sa mani\u00e8re de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'ensemble des questions. Mme Lachance a fait remarquer qu'il devait adopter une attitude plus tol\u00e9rante et apprendre \u00e0 faire montre de discernement.\n[171] Le comit\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait fortement sous l'influence de la culture et des valeurs de la GRC, qui diff\u00e9raient de celles du SPCUM. Mme Lachance se souvenait que le plaignant avait racont\u00e9 qu'il avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s'int\u00e9grer \u00e0 la GRC, surtout comme francophone mais aussi en tant que personne de race noire. Il avait dit au comit\u00e9 qu'il avait fait des efforts consid\u00e9rables pour s'adapter. Finalement, il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner pour se rapprocher de sa famille. Le plaignant n'a jamais inform\u00e9 le comit\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 parce qu'il s'attendait d'\u00e9chouer sa FPR. Monique Cyr, qui \u00e9tait responsable du processus de s\u00e9lection et d'\u00e9valuation du rendement des policiers de la Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, a expliqu\u00e9 que le fait que le plaignant ait dissimul\u00e9 l'\u00e9chec auquel il \u00e9tait sur le point d'\u00eatre confront\u00e9 dans la GRC aurait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9couvert ult\u00e9rieurement au cours du processus - lors de l'enqu\u00eate sur la r\u00e9putation du candidat. Si un tel manque de franchise avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvert \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, un rapport d\u00e9favorable aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 au sujet de sa r\u00e9putation et, en l'absence d'une explication justifiable, sa candidature aurait aussit\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e.\n[172] Le score du plaignant ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 la norme applicable aux postes de policier, mais le SPCUM \u00e9tait \u00e9galement en qu\u00eate de policiers auxiliaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Les policiers auxiliaires s'occupaient principalement des d\u00e9tenus des centres de d\u00e9tention du SPCUM. Ils ne portaient pas d'arme. Le score minimal pour un poste de policier auxiliaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 50 %. Comme le plaignant avait atteint ce niveau et avait manifest\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un tel poste, le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de continuer de traiter sa demande, mais uniquement pour un poste de ce genre.\n[173] Le dossier du plaignant est donc pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape suivante. Cette \u00e9tape consistait en une \u00e9valuation psychom\u00e9trique du candidat, au cours de laquelle on mesurait scientifiquement ses traits psychologiques. Tous les candidats devaient subir ce test. Dans le cas du plaignant, le test a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9 par le Dr Anne Genevi\u00e8ve Girard, Ph. D., qui est psychologue industrielle et membre de l'Ordre des conseillers en ressources humaines et en relations industrielles agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec. Le Dr Girard avait obtenu du SPCUM le mandat de d\u00e9terminer si des candidats \u00e9taient atteints de psychopathologie et de brosser un tableau g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la personnalit\u00e9 de chaque candidat. Avant de pr\u00e9parer son \u00e9valuation du plaignant, elle n'avait re\u00e7u aucun renseignement au sujet de sa premi\u00e8re entrevue ou des conclusions du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection; elle n'\u00e9tait donc pas au courant de la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d'examiner la candidature du plaignant en fonction uniquement du poste de policier auxiliaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir interview\u00e9 le plaignant et l'avoir soumis au test, le Dr Girard a conclu qu'il n'\u00e9tait atteint d'aucun trouble pouvant entra\u00eener le rejet imm\u00e9diat de sa candidature. Cependant, elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il ne satisfaisait qu'en partie aux exigences du poste de policier.\n[174] Les scores du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction de ceux obtenus par toutes les autres personnes ayant postul\u00e9 un emploi aupr\u00e8s du SPCUM - environ 600. Il a obtenu la cote faible pour trois des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9valu\u00e9s (sens des responsabilit\u00e9s, sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 autrui, flexibilit\u00e9), ce qui impliquait que ses scores \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux de 85 % des membres du groupe (c.-\u00e0-d. inf\u00e9rieurs au 15e percentile). Compte tenu de ces r\u00e9sultats, le Dr Girard a \u00e9crit dans son rapport au comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection que le plaignant ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 la norme pour ce qui est du sens des responsabilit\u00e9s, qu'il manquait de sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'autrui et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas flexible. Il avait tendance \u00e0 tenir assez fermement \u00e0 ses id\u00e9es et \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre tr\u00e8s sensible aux points de vue d'autrui. Dans ses recommandations, le Dr Girard a affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant pourrait satisfaire aux exigences du poste d'agent de patrouille au SPCUM, et elle a propos\u00e9 de poursuivre l'examen de sa candidature. Toutefois, dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas le mandat d'exclure des candidats qui ne pr\u00e9sentaient pas de psychopathologie. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, son avis \u00e9tait fourni \u00e0 titre consultatif et ne liait pas, par cons\u00e9quent, le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection.\n[175] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport du Dr Girard, le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer ses propres conclusions. Le jury a constat\u00e9 que la rigidit\u00e9 dont faisait montre le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas vraiment attribuable au milieu qu'il venait de quitter (GRC) et qu'il s'agissait d'un trait de sa personnalit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le comit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas donner suite \u00e0 la candidature du plaignant, m\u00eame pour le poste de policier auxiliaire. Une lettre en date du 14 mai 1998 a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9e au plaignant pour l'informer qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, sur la foi de son examen psychom\u00e9trique, que sa candidature ne correspondait pas au profil recherch\u00e9 du poste de policier au SPCUM.\n[176] Le SPCUM n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul employeur \u00e9ventuel \u00e0 soumettre le plaignant \u00e0 des tests psychom\u00e9triques. Le 9 avril 1998, le plaignant avait postul\u00e9 un emploi de policier aupr\u00e8s de la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (CN). Dans sa demande, il avait inscrit [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9mission comme motif de cessation de son emploi ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la GRC. Le CN a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les aptitudes du plaignant au moyen de la batterie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de test d'aptitudes, qui mesure certaines mais pas toutes les aptitudes de base requises pour occuper la fonction de commis. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e9taient l'intelligence, les aptitudes verbales et l'aptitude \u00e0 la num\u00e9rotation. Le CN a fix\u00e9 la note de passage au 25e percentile, ce qui signifie que 75 % de la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale obtiendrait un score sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce seuil. Le plaignant s'est class\u00e9 entre les 38e et 45e percentiles pour les trois aptitudes \u00e9valu\u00e9es par le CN. Il a donc r\u00e9ussi le test et s'est vu offrir un emploi au CN. On lui avait d'abord indiqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait un poste \u00e0 pourvoir au Qu\u00e9bec, mais on ne lui a offert qu'un poste \u00e0 Toronto. Il a refus\u00e9 l'offre.\n[177] Le plaignant n'a pas limit\u00e9 sa recherche d'emploi au secteur policier. Il examinait \u00e9galement les offres d'emploi publi\u00e9es dans les journaux. Au d\u00e9but de 1998, il a travaill\u00e9 comme garde de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans un foyer pour personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es. Il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au deuxi\u00e8me poste (minuit \u00e0 midi) et touchait 10 $ l'heure. En 1998, durant la saison des achats de No\u00ebl, il a travaill\u00e9 comme d\u00e9tective dans quelques magasins \u00e0 rayons. Il a exerc\u00e9 plusieurs emplois \u00e0 temps partiel. En 1999, il a obtenu un poste contractuel \u00e0 temps plein de garde de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans un coll\u00e8ge priv\u00e9. Malheureusement, l'une de ses t\u00e2ches consistait \u00e0 vider les poubelles. Comparativement aux fonctions et responsabilit\u00e9s qu'il avait exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de policier de la GRC, il trouvait que ce travail \u00e9tait d\u00e9gradant et portait atteinte \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation. Toutefois, il n'avait pas le choix. Il \u00e9tait lourdement endett\u00e9. La faillite n'\u00e9tait pas une solution envisageable, car cela aurait sans doute annihil\u00e9 ses possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi dans le secteur policier.\n[178] Le plaignant cherchait \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer sa formation scolaire; aussi s'est-il inscrit \u00e0 des cours de pr\u00e9vention de la toxicomanie donn\u00e9 par correspondance par l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Il a obtenu son certificat en moins de deux ans. Par la suite, il a suivi des cours de gestion polici\u00e8re offerts par cette m\u00eame universit\u00e9.\n[179] En juillet 1999, le plaignant a postul\u00e9 un emploi de patrouilleur - ma\u00eetre de chien aupr\u00e8s de l'organisme charg\u00e9 de l'exploitation des a\u00e9roports de Montr\u00e9al (A\u00e9roports de Montr\u00e9al ou ADM). Le r\u00f4le de ces policiers et de leurs chiens consistait \u00e0 inspecter des avions, des v\u00e9hicules, des colis ou tout autre objet pouvant contenir des explosifs. Cette t\u00e2che avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie par des policiers sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s de la GRC jusqu'en 2000, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la fonction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e directement \u00e0 ADM. La demande du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e dans le cadre de la premi\u00e8re campagne de recrutement d'ADM - celle qui visait \u00e0 remplacer les policiers de la GRC.\n[180] Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la formule de demande d'emploi que le candidat devait fournir des renseignements exacts, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi sa demande pouvait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. On demandait notamment au candidat s'il avait par le pass\u00e9 \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 ou pri\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner de quelque poste que ce soit. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus loin dans le document qu'il avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi au sein de la GRC parce qu'il travaillait trop loin de chez lui (Montr\u00e9al), que les loyers en Colombie-Britannique \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s et qu'il \u00e9tait peu probable qu'il puisse \u00eatre mut\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec dans les dix ann\u00e9es qui suivraient.\n[181] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen \u00e9crit, qui devait \u00eatre termin\u00e9 dans un laps de temps prescrit. Dans la premi\u00e8re partie, le candidat devait \u00e9tablir en fran\u00e7ais des rapports d'incident apr\u00e8s avoir visionn\u00e9 deux vid\u00e9ocassettes. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me partie, il devait r\u00e9pondre en anglais \u00e0 deux questions, dont l'une portait \u00e9galement sur une vid\u00e9ocassette. Les personnes qui ont corrig\u00e9 cet examen n'ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience; toutefois, la feuille de r\u00e9ponses du plaignant, ainsi que les observations des \u00e9valuateurs, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. L'un des rapports d'incident portait la mention insatisfaisant. Sur l'autre rapport, on pouvait lire ce qui suit satisfaisant - Borderline -- chronologie laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. En ce qui concerne les r\u00e9ponses en anglais, la r\u00e9ponse fond\u00e9e sur la vid\u00e9ocassette portait la mention insatisfaisant et l'autre, la mention satisfaisant.\n[182] La candidature du plaignant est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape suivante, qui consistait en une entrevue men\u00e9e en ao\u00fbt 1999. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement subi un test d'aptitudes physiques et des tests de s\u00e9lection sur le terrain rigoureux qui se sont \u00e9chelonn\u00e9s sur plusieurs jours. En septembre 1999, ADM lui a offert un poste \u00e0 temps plein pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il travaille encore l\u00e0 aujourd'hui. C'est un travail qu'il juge tr\u00e8s enrichissant. Il intervient chaque fois qu'il y a une alerte \u00e0 la bombe ou qu'on d\u00e9couvre un colis suspect. Il inspecte bagages et a\u00e9ronefs; si ses enqu\u00eates se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent n\u00e9gatives, il autorise les \u00e9quipages \u00e0 faire monter les passagers \u00e0 bord des appareils. Le 11 septembre 2001, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9. Avec l'aide de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec et de la GRC, il a inspect\u00e9 21 avions interdits de vol \u00e0 la suite des d\u00e9tournements survenus aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[183] Le plaignant a soutenu qu'il poss\u00e8de les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre policier du fait qu'il s'est bien tir\u00e9 d'affaire dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, et surtout parce que celles-ci \u00e9taient remplies auparavant par des policiers de la GRC. L'intim\u00e9e conteste cette all\u00e9gation, faisant remarquer que le plaignant n'est pas officiellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un policier, qu'il n'a pas le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des arrestations, qu'il ne porte pas d'arme et qu'il ne m\u00e8ne pas d'enqu\u00eates.\nM. D\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte au Commissariat aux langues officielles [184] Avant de d\u00e9poser la pr\u00e9sente plainte sur les droits de la personne, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte au Commissariat aux langues officielles (CLO) le 28 mai 1998. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, m\u00eame s'il satisfaisait aux exigences linguistiques de son poste \u00e0 Burnaby, parce que les officiers sup\u00e9rieurs du d\u00e9tachement ne le jugeaient pas suffisamment comp\u00e9tent en anglais. L'employ\u00e9 du CLO qui a re\u00e7u sa plainte a inscrit ce qui suit sur le formulaire de plainte : est conscient que la plainte ne porte pas sur une question de discrimination.\n[185] Le 3 juillet 1998, le plaignant s'est rendu en compagnie de son avocat dans les bureaux du CLO \u00e0 Ottawa o\u00f9 il a fait une d\u00e9claration au sujet de sa plainte. Les notes qui ont apparemment \u00e9t\u00e9 prises par des employ\u00e9s du CLO qui l'ont rencontr\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve, mais les employ\u00e9s en question n'ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Il est fait mention dans ces notes de la plupart des incidents relat\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait qu'on le surnommait OBO ou cul de Kirby Puckett l'aga\u00e7ait. Cependant, rien dans les notes n'indique qu'il estimait que ces surnoms \u00e9taient racistes. En fait, le plaignant n'a formul\u00e9 aucune all\u00e9gation de racisme devant le CLO.\n[186] Quelques mois plus tard, le 9 septembre 1998, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[187] En septembre 1999, le CLO a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son rapport final apr\u00e8s avoir fait enqu\u00eate. Il a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant voulant qu'il ait perdu son emploi en raison d'une connaissance insuffisante de l'anglais ou qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement linguistique.\nII. ANALYSE A. Plainte aux termes de l'article 7 [188] Aux termes de l'article 7 de la Loi, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un employ\u00e9 en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un des motifs de distinction illicite, notamment la couleur. Le fait de renvoyer un employ\u00e9 pour un tel motif de distinction illicite constitue \u00e9galement un acte discriminatoire.\n[189] Il incombe \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une telle preuve, on se fonde surtout sur l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, par. 28 (l'arr\u00eat O'Malley). Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour pr\u00e9cise que la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Une fois que l'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il appartient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable montrant que les pr\u00e9tentions relatives au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire ne sont pas fond\u00e9es ou que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre non discriminatoire. Si une explication raisonnable est fournie, il revient \u00e0 la partie plaignante de d\u00e9montrer que l'explication n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte (voir Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au par. 38474 (T.C.D.P.); Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 C.A.F. 204, aux par. 17 et 18).\n[190] Pour que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination constitue le seul motif sous-jacent \u00e0 la conduite jug\u00e9e r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Il suffit qu'elle soit l'un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au par. 7 (C.A.F.)). Dans les affaires de discrimination, la norme de preuve est celle qui s'applique dans les causes civiles ordinaires, soit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[191] Comme on l'a fait remarquer dans Basi (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) au paragraphe 38481, la discrimination n'est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu'on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. Le tribunal doit donc tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. On peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, (Toronto : Carswell, 1987), \u00e0 la p. 142; voir aussi Chopra c. Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (TCDP)).\nB. Preuve prima facie [192] Le plaignant a soutenu qu'il a fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent tout au cours de sa FPR et que sa couleur est un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que sa couleur a influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi ou, subsidiairement, que les comportements abusifs \u00e0 son endroit ont nui \u00e0 son rendement et ont entra\u00een\u00e9, en bout de ligne, son cong\u00e9diement.\n[193] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente par les trois formateurs charg\u00e9s de sa formation. En ce qui concerne le gend. Haney, il cite les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n- chronom\u00e9trage des d\u00e9lais d'intervention du plaignant;\n- chronom\u00e9trage de la r\u00e9daction de ses rapports;\n- insistance pour qu'il r\u00e9crive ses rapports;\n- refus de l'autoriser \u00e0 utiliser les ordinateurs du bureau;\n- insistance sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de modifier la pr\u00e9sentation de son carnet;\n- refus de faire mention de ses bons coups ou actions louables dans les rapports d'\u00e9valuation;\n- fait de crier constamment apr\u00e8s lui;\n- fait d'avoir affirm\u00e9 quelques semaines apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de sa FPR qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas fait pour \u00eatre policier et qu'il devrait songer \u00e0 quitter la GRC.\n[194] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que les autres stagiaires n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re. Il estime que sa couleur a influenc\u00e9 le comportement du gend. Haney \u00e0 son endroit; \u00e0 l'appui de son all\u00e9gation, il a mentionn\u00e9 :\n- le fait qu'il le surnommait OBO ou cul de Kirby Puckett;\n- le fait qu'il lui ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 lui et au gend. St-Fleur s'ils s'\u00e9taient serr\u00e9s la main \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on des Noirs.\n[195] Le plaignant a soutenu non seulement que le terme OBO rappelle les ventes d'esclaves aux ench\u00e8res, mais aussi que le gend. Haney faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en l'utilisant \u00e0 l'erreur qu'il avait faite lors de sa premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de travail. Il s'agissait donc d'un terme \u00e9voquant un manque d'intelligence, ce qui selon ses dires, est un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype raciste n\u00e9gatif associ\u00e9 aux personnes de race noire.\n[196] Le plaignant a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner le Dr Frances Henry, Ph.D., F.R.S.C., \u00e0 titre dexperte en raison de sa vaste connaissance des notions de racisme, de discrimination raciale et de harc\u00e8lement dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et en milieu de travail dans la perspective des sciences sociales. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a indiqu\u00e9 que l'allusion \u00e0 Kirby Puckett, qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour son gros derri\u00e8re, visait \u00e0 attirer l'attention sur [TRADUCTION] l'un des attributs physiques bien connus d'un grand nombre de personnes d'origine africaine - leur post\u00e9rieur aux rondeurs robustes. Elle soutient qu'il s'agissait donc d'un surnom d\u00e9plac\u00e9, compte tenu particuli\u00e8rement de la relation asym\u00e9trique qui existait entre le formateur et son stagiaire. Le plaignant ne pouvait gu\u00e8re contester l'emploi d'une telle terminologie et n'avait d'autre choix que de l'accepter en silence.\n[197] Le fait que le gend. Haney chronom\u00e9trait sans cesse le plaignant dans son travail donnait \u00e0 croire que ce dernier \u00e9tait paresseux et lent. Selon le Dr Henry, il est possible que cette pratique corresponde \u00e0 un autre st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, vu [TRADUCTION] l'image forte et tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative voulant que les Noirs soient lents.\n[198] Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir continu\u00e9 de faire l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent alors qu'il \u00e9tait sous la tutelle du gend. Carr. Ce dernier chronom\u00e9trait ses activit\u00e9s, ne faisait pas mention dans les rapports d'\u00e9valuation de ses actions dignes de louange et avait tent\u00e9 de le persuader de quitter la GRC. De l'avis du plaignant, le gend. Carr a aussi jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision du gend. Marx d'\u00e9tablir une deuxi\u00e8me fiche de rendement relativement au quart o\u00f9 il avait fait \u00e9quipe avec lui, afin d'annihiler le message positif que v\u00e9hiculait au sujet du plaignant une fiche de rendement ant\u00e9rieure.\n[199] On a fait valoir que l'attitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du gend. Carr ne favorisait pas l'\u00e9tablissement d'une zone de confort entre les deux hommes et faisait en sorte que le plaignant h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 poser des questions et \u00e0 demander conseil. Les lacunes dans sa formation ant\u00e9rieure, qui \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 la pi\u00e8tre fa\u00e7on dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par le gend. Haney, \u00e9taient donc exacerb\u00e9es. Son rendement s'en est certes ressenti.\n[200] Le plaignant a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente durant la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode de prolongation de sa FPR, alors qu'il \u00e9tait sous la tutelle du gend. McDonald. De l'avis du plaignant, les circonstances entourant l'incident du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1997 illustrent clairement qu'il a fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent comparativement aux autres recrues et membres de la GRC. Non seulement a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 et physiquement agress\u00e9 par le gend. McDonald dans le hall d'entr\u00e9e de l'immeuble, mais on lui a par la suite coll\u00e9 trois fiches de rendement 1004 n\u00e9gatives - un fait sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui a pratiquement scell\u00e9 son sort. Le plaignant a soutenu avoir \u00e0 nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 pers\u00e9cut\u00e9 lors de l'intervention aupr\u00e8s de l'adolescente qui n'avait pas pay\u00e9 sa course en taxi. Les policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur l'ont alors ridiculis\u00e9. Leurs gestes \u00e9taient injustifi\u00e9s.\n[201] En outre, le gend. McDonald, \u00e0 l'instar des autres formateurs, n'a pas tenu compte de certains bons coups du plaignant. En fait, le plaignant se demande comment on en est venu \u00e0 prendre la d\u00e9cision de le cong\u00e9dier, compte tenu de l'excellent rendement qu'il a affich\u00e9 lors de la derni\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de quarts de travail et du sommet de l'APEC. Il croit qu'un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment peut avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le - la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa couleur.\n[202] \u00c0 l'appui de cette affirmation, le plaignant a cit\u00e9 les trois incidents suivants :\n- le dessin du gend. McDonald dans lequel certains traits physiques du gend. St-Fleur, un policier de race noire, \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et le commentaire subs\u00e9quent du gend. McDonald comparant les traits du gend. St-Fleur avec ceux du plaignant;\n- la remarque du gend. McDonald donnant \u00e0 entendre que le gend. St-Fleur \u00e9tait plus sale que la cravate du gend. McDonald;\n- les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs du gend. McDonald \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des politiques d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi de la GRC.\n[203] Par ailleurs, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il s'est produit en quelque sorte une r\u00e9action en cha\u00eene d'une p\u00e9riode de FPR \u00e0 l'autre. \u00c0 son avis, les rapports d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tablis au cours de sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de FPR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 empreints de l'attitude discriminatoire du gend. Haney. Les perceptions n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant ont persist\u00e9, ces rapports \u00e9tant lus par les autres formateurs qui lui ont succ\u00e9d\u00e9s, lesquels ont, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s par l'attitude discriminatoire du gend. Haney. Cette situation a d\u00e9teint naturellement sur d'autres membres du d\u00e9tachement. Ainsi, de nombreux t\u00e9moins qui travaillaient au d\u00e9tachement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque savaient que le plaignant \u00e9tait surnomm\u00e9 OBO et connaissaient m\u00eame l'origine de ce surnom (annonces concernant des voitures usag\u00e9es). De l'avis du plaignant, la rumeur voulant que le gend. Haney ait une pi\u00e8tre opinion de son rendement s'\u00e9tait de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on propag\u00e9e aux autres policiers du d\u00e9tachement.\n[204] Bien que son rendement durant sa FPR ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 par les trois formateurs qui ont travaill\u00e9 directement avec lui, le plaignant a soutenu que son cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision qui, en bout de ligne, appartenait \u00e0 l'insp. Schlecker. Son dossier renfermait, selon ses dires, de nombreux commentaires offensants de l'insp. Schlecker illustrant les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s de ce dernier \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des minorit\u00e9s visibles. Le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d'exemples, l'emploi du terme personne de couleur (coloured) et le commentaire au sujet du Canadien moyen de race blanche et d'origine europ\u00e9enne.\n[205] En outre, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ces remarques d\u00e9notaient l'existence de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s r\u00e9pandus contre les minorit\u00e9s visibles qui d\u00e9teignaient sur l'ensemble du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Certains t\u00e9moins ont admis que le terme DWO (driving while oriental - Asiatique au volant) avait parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque par quelques policiers. L'emploi de ce terme et les commentaires de l'insp. Schlecker d\u00e9notaient ce que le Dr Henry a appel\u00e9 le discours dissociatif - nous et eux - que tenait le personnel du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, o\u00f9 les membres de groupes minoritaires \u00e9taient per\u00e7us comme des \u00e9trangers.\n[206] En d\u00e9finitive, la situation du plaignant se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 un point qui est simple. Il est un homme de race noire qui, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il a r\u00e9ussi sa formation \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t, s'est fait dire qu'il ne r\u00e9ussirait pas sa FPR et ne serait pas embauch\u00e9 comme membre r\u00e9gulier. En fait, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par la GRC. Selon la preuve, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le plaignant a suivi sa FPR, les seules personnes qui avaient eu besoin d'une prolongation pour r\u00e9ussir leur FPR au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby \u00e9taient deux hommes de race noire (le gend. St-Fleur et le gend. Knight). Il semblerait que peu de temps avant la FPR du plaignant, une femme de race blanche n'ait pas r\u00e9ussi sa FPR. De plus, le gend. St-Fleur, \u00e0 l'instar du plaignant, s'est fait dire par son premier formateur (gend. Marx) pendant sa FPR qu'il devrait songer \u00e0 s'orienter vers une autre carri\u00e8re. Le gend. Marx estimait \u00e9galement que le gend. St-Fleur devait am\u00e9liorer sa capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir les probl\u00e8mes et ses comp\u00e9tences d\u00e9cisionnelles.\n[207] Compte tenu de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et compte tenu du crit\u00e8re O'Malley, je suis convaincu que si l'on ajoute foi \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, celles-ci sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. L'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nC. L'explication de la GRC [208] Selon la GRC, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu'il n'avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises pour \u00eatre un membre r\u00e9gulier. Aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment n'a jou\u00e9 dans son cong\u00e9diement. Les policiers jouissent de pouvoirs extraordinaires dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est essentiel qu'ils soient fiables et honn\u00eates et qu'ils aient un bon jugement. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. C'est au cours de la p\u00e9riode de stage qu'un corps de police \u00e9value ces qualit\u00e9s essentielles chez une recrue. Si un nouveau membre ne d\u00e9montre pas qu'il satisfait \u00e0 ces exigences, il est alors dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[209] De l'avis de l'intim\u00e9e, le plaignant n'a pas les qualit\u00e9s et les aptitudes requises pour exercer un bon jugement de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et pr\u00e9visible. La preuve montre qu'il \u00e9tait incapable sous le stress de raisonner comme il se doit et qu'il ne pouvait expliquer ni justifier les d\u00e9cisions qu'il prenait. Il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi non plus \u00e0 prouver qu'il \u00e9tait constamment en mesure de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances lorsqu'il devait prendre une d\u00e9cision.\n[210] Un employ\u00e9 en stage ne jouit pas de la m\u00eame s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi qu'un employ\u00e9 permanent. L'employ\u00e9 en stage est soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode d'essai, de d\u00e9monstration ou d'examen de ses qualifications et de son aptitude \u00e0 exercer un emploi r\u00e9gulier en tant qu'employ\u00e9 permanent (Jacmain c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Canada), [1978] R.C.S. 15, \u00e0 la p. 38). L'employeur peut mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi d'un employ\u00e9 en stage s'il est d'avis que ce dernier n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 atteindre les normes \u00e9tablies et que son rendement est insatisfaisant.\n[211] Dans Daniels v. Hamilton-Wentworth (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board (no. 2) (1996), 31 C.H.R.R. D\/189 (commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario), ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de l'embauche de policiers. Le plaignant all\u00e9guait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 presque \u00e0 la fin de son stage de gendarme en raison de sa race et de sa couleur. La commission d'enqu\u00eate a conclu que sa race n'avait pas influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision, tout en faisant remarquer (paragraphe 125) que l'employeur a le droit de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 s'il est d'avis qu'il est peu probable que ce dernier atteindra les normes de rendement en vigueur au sein de l'organisation. Les critiques \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rendement sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui peuvent \u00eatre l\u00e9gitimement pris en compte lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9valuer si un gendarme stagiaire a les qualit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour devenir membre d'un service de police permanent.\n[212] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence en stage. Il devait satisfaire aux normes du programme de formation pratique \u00e0 son sixi\u00e8me mois d'\u00e9valuation pour qu'on recommande qu'il soit admis dans les rangs de la GRC comme membre r\u00e9gulier. Si cette condition n'\u00e9tait pas remplie, l'employeur pouvait l\u00e9gitimement le cong\u00e9dier dans la mesure o\u00f9 sa d\u00e9cision n\u00e9tait pas empreinte de mauvaise foi (voir Jacmain (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), \u00e0 la p. 37) et n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par une conduite illicite aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[213] La m\u00e9thode d'\u00e9valuation appliqu\u00e9e par la GRC durant la formation pratique \u00e9tait dans une large mesure subjective. Les formateurs \u00e9valuaient les recrues en fonction de certains crit\u00e8res, mais les normes et m\u00e9thodes d'\u00e9valuation pouvaient, on peut l'imaginer, varier d'un formateur \u00e0 l'autre. Par exemple, le plaignant a soutenu que le gend. Haney \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement rigide dans ses m\u00e9thodes et ses \u00e9valuations. Toutefois, comme on l'a fait remarquer dans Folch c. Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien International (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/261, au par. 165 (T.C.D.P.), le fait que l'employeur ait \u00e9valu\u00e9 les candidats selon des crit\u00e8res subjectifs ne rend pas en soi ses d\u00e9cisions d'embauche susceptibles de contestation aux termes de la Loi. Lorsque des crit\u00e8res subjectifs sont appliqu\u00e9s, il peut s'av\u00e9rer n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner plus minutieusement les d\u00e9cisions d'embauche afin de v\u00e9rifier que les \u00e9valuations subjectives ne servent pas \u00e0 masquer la discrimination. Il n'appartient pas au Tribunal d'approuver ou non chaque d\u00e9cision d'embauche prise par l'employeur durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e. Son r\u00f4le consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la partie plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'un des motifs de distinction illicite invoqu\u00e9s.\n[214] Le plaignant a-t-il satisfait aux normes de la GRC? Au dire de l'intim\u00e9e, la r\u00e9ponse est ind\u00e9niablement n\u00e9gative. La situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9ticuleusement document\u00e9e non pas par un, mais bien par trois formateurs diff\u00e9rents. Au d\u00e9but, il y avait plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments inqui\u00e9tants; toutefois, en bout de ligne, la pr\u00e9occupation commune et principale de chacun des formateurs r\u00e9sidait dans l'aptitude \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions, qui repr\u00e9sentait l'un des 28 crit\u00e8res prescrits de comp\u00e9tence qui s'appliquaient aux recrues. La norme du programme de formation pratique \u00e9num\u00e8re 11 comp\u00e9tences d\u00e9cisionnelles dont doit faire preuve une recrue pour r\u00e9ussir. La recrue doit \u00eatre en mesure notamment :\nde prendre des d\u00e9cisions professionnelles tenant compte des besoins de la collectivit\u00e9, m\u00eame dans des situations difficiles et stressantes;\nd'examiner les diverses options possibles;\nde tenir compte d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments d'information nouveaux ou de conseils et de r\u00e9examiner une d\u00e9cision;\nde d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on claire et concise ses d\u00e9cisions, et de r\u00e9pondre aux questions ou aux contestations.\n[215] Selon l'intim\u00e9e, les incidents d\u00e9crits dans chacun des trois rapports d'\u00e9valuation des formateurs montrent que le plaignant n'avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises relativement \u00e0 chacune de ces comp\u00e9tences. Ainsi, il n'a manifest\u00e9 aucune de ces quatre qualit\u00e9s lors de son intervention aupr\u00e8s de l'adolescente et du chauffeur de taxi dans la quatri\u00e8me semaine de sa deuxi\u00e8me prolongation, peu avant sa d\u00e9mission de la GRC. Il n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la collectivit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'arrestation de la jeune fille, ce qu'il a fait sans avoir examin\u00e9 aucune solution de rechange. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9fendre sa d\u00e9cision lorsque des membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur l'ont remise en question et lorsque de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'information lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis (la version de l'adolescente). Il a fallu qu'on l'incite \u00e0 reconsid\u00e9rer sa d\u00e9cision.\n[216] En outre, en tentant de justifier ses erreurs et de se d\u00e9rober aux critiques, il aurait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment induit en erreur des sup\u00e9rieurs, comme cela s'est produit dans l'incident auquel le cap. Waters a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9 et au cours duquel le plaignant a faussement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en cour toute la journ\u00e9e le 6 novembre 1997. Ce comportement montre, a-t-on soutenu, qu'il n'a pas l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle on s'attend de la part d'un policier de la GRC.\n[217] Les trois formateurs n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 les seuls \u00e0 conclure que les comp\u00e9tences d\u00e9cisionnelles du plaignant laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Le gend. Albert \u00e9tait d'avis que le plaignant portait rapidement un jugement et n'avait pas m\u00fbri sa d\u00e9cision lorsqu'il n'avait pas raccompagn\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 son foyer collectif l'adolescente qui avait commis un vol \u00e0 l'\u00e9talage. Le gend. Van Overbeek s'est plaint de la d\u00e9cision du plaignant de laisser un suspect sans surveillance sur les lieux d'un crime. Le gend. Akow a mis en doute sa d\u00e9cision de garder dans son casier pendant un mois une quantit\u00e9 de marijuana qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie. Le gend. Merritt a reproch\u00e9 au plaignant de s'\u00eatre concentr\u00e9 sur une querelle civile plut\u00f4t que de s'attarder au crime pour lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9.\n[218] Rien dans la preuve n'\u00e9taye l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant voulant que ces policiers et les formateurs qui ont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 au gend. Haney aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre influenc\u00e9s par les soi-disant pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux du premier formateur. Apr\u00e8s tout, Burnaby \u00e9tait un tr\u00e8s gros d\u00e9tachement et le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 au cours de sa FPR avec plusieurs \u00e9quipes, pendant divers quarts de travail et dans trois districts diff\u00e9rents. Le gend. McDonald ne connaissait m\u00eame pas le gend. Haney et connaissait \u00e0 peine le gend. Carr.\n[219] Le plaignant a contest\u00e9 la plupart des opinions n\u00e9gatives ayant trait \u00e0 son rendement. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tort et que ses versions et les explications qui ont transpir\u00e9 des divers incidents cit\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en compte. Dans la plupart des cas, le plaignant estime avoir agi comme il se doit ou pense que les erreurs qu'il a commises \u00e9taient sans cons\u00e9quence et ne justifiaient pas les critiques formul\u00e9es. C'est peut-\u00eatre le cas; toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, nous ne devons pas perdre de vue le fait qu'il s'agissait d'une p\u00e9riode de stage au cours de laquelle l'employeur \u00e9valuait de fa\u00e7on subjective les comp\u00e9tences du candidat. Le simple fait que le rendement du plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 par ses formateurs et d'autres policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur ne prouve pas qu'il ait fait l'objet de discrimination. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans Folch, il n'appartient pas au Tribunal de trouver \u00e0 redire \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de rendement d'un employ\u00e9 s'il n'y a pas de preuves qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par un motif de distinction illicite. Il n'appartient pas non plus au Tribunal de contester le choix des m\u00e9thodes de formation ou d'\u00e9valuation appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un employ\u00e9 (chronom\u00e9trage de ses interventions \u00e0 la suite des appels, obligation d'utiliser une pr\u00e9sentation particuli\u00e8re dans un carnet, etc.), dans la mesure o\u00f9, r\u00e9p\u00e9tons-le, la discrimination n'a pas influenc\u00e9 ce choix.\n[220] Le plaignant a soutenu que si l'on tient compte de la preuve circonstancielle entourant sa FPR \u00e0 Burnaby, on peut inf\u00e9rer que l'explication de la GRC n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte et qu'en fait, la couleur est un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans son cong\u00e9diement. L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve le plus souvent cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation est le fait que le gend. Haney l'ait affubl\u00e9 du surnom OBO et que ce surnom ait continu\u00e9 par la suite d'\u00eatre employ\u00e9 par ses formateurs et d'autres personnes au d\u00e9tachement. Cependant, je n'accepte pas la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant voulant que ce terme soit charg\u00e9 de connotations \u00e9vocatrices des ventes d'esclaves aux ench\u00e8res dans l'Am\u00e9rique d'avant l'\u00e9mancipation. Aucun ouvrage de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence (dictionnaire, encyclop\u00e9die, almanach, etc.) n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 pour corroborer cette pr\u00e9tention. Au contraire, l'un des propres t\u00e9moins du plaignant, le Dr Henry, une sp\u00e9cialiste des questions li\u00e9es au racisme et \u00e0 la discrimination raciale, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'avait jamais entendu parler de l'utilisation des termes OBO ou or best offer comme \u00e9pith\u00e8tes racistes. On a nettement l'impression qu'il s'agit d'une nouvelle acception qui est attribuable au seul but d'\u00e9tayer sa cause. Je n'oublie pas que l'un des t\u00e9moins du plaignant, le gend. Aubrey Bacchus, un policier de la GRC qui l'a c\u00f4toy\u00e9 \u00e0 Burnaby, a affirm\u00e9 qu'il connaissait les pr\u00e9tendues connotations pr\u00eat\u00e9es au terme OBO. Toutefois, son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait \u00e9tonnamment similaire \u00e0 celui du plaignant. Vu l'absence flagrante d'autres sources ind\u00e9pendantes attestant cette d\u00e9finition, le t\u00e9moignage du gend. Bacchus est douteux. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas du tout persuad\u00e9 que le terme comporte des connotations raciales.\n[221] Mais qu'en est-il de l'all\u00e9gation subsidiaire du plaignant selon laquelle ce surnom \u00e9voque un manque d'intelligence, ce qui correspond \u00e0 un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype raciste? \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je constate que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas la seule personne au sein de la GRC qui avait un surnom. Le cap. Cousins a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un policier ayant souffert de p\u00e9diculose lors de son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 la Division D\u00e9p\u00f4t avait \u00e9t\u00e9 surnomm\u00e9 Bugs pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Le gend. McDonald a dit se souvenir qu'une autre recrue qui s'\u00e9tait, semble-t-il, m\u00e9prise sur le sens de l'abr\u00e9viation L.N.U. concernant un suspect (last name unknown - nom de famille inconnu) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 surnomm\u00e9e ainsi. Le gend. Anthony Akow a indiqu\u00e9 qu'on le surnommait Silent H (H muet) du fait qu'il pronon\u00e7ait son pr\u00e9nom Antony. Le gend. Haney a affirm\u00e9 qu'on le surnommait Dumbo \u00e0 cause de la forme de ses oreilles, et Weenie Boy parce qu'il aimait les chiens chauds.\n[222] Aucun de ces termes n'est particuli\u00e8rement flatteur, voire respectueux de la dignit\u00e9 d'autrui. Le gend. Haney, entre autres, a confirm\u00e9 qu'il est de plus en plus mal accept\u00e9 au sein de la GRC de s'adresser \u00e0 quelqu'un autrement que par son vrai nom. Il y a peut-\u00eatre lieu de se r\u00e9jouir de cette \u00e9volution. Toutefois, fait-il pour autant en conclure que les surnoms utilis\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9 \u00e9taient discriminatoires? En ce qui touche le terme OBO, aucun des t\u00e9moins qui employaient ce surnom lorsqu'ils s'adressaient au plaignant ou qui en connaissaient l'existence n'a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vocateur d'un manque d'intelligence de la part du plaignant. Au contraire, plusieurs t\u00e9moins, dont le gend. Haney, ont not\u00e9 qu'ils consid\u00e9raient le plaignant comme une personne intelligente, voire amicale. L'explication du gend. Haney voulant que ce sobriquet ne faisait que refl\u00e9ter le niveau de camaraderie qui existait entre les membres du d\u00e9tachement est tout \u00e0 fait conforme aux images qu'on peut voir sur la vid\u00e9ocassette. Aucun des t\u00e9moins n'a dit dans son t\u00e9moignage que le plaignant lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 de cesser de l'appeler ainsi. Au regard de l'ensemble de ces circonstances, je ne suis pas convaincu que l'utilisation de ce surnom par le gend. Haney donne \u00e0 croire que ses opinions relativement \u00e0 l'intelligence du plaignant \u00e9taient empreintes de connotations raciales ou discriminatoires.\n[223] Le surnom cul de Kirby Puckett, du fait qu'il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au r\u00e9put\u00e9 athl\u00e8te d'origine afro-am\u00e9ricaine, aurait pu sembler \u00eatre plus \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la couleur du plaignant, compte tenu particuli\u00e8rement du t\u00e9moignage relativement confus du plaignant quant \u00e0 l'origine du terme. Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 l'impression qu'un jour, le gend. Haney s'est tourn\u00e9 vers lui soudainement et sans la pr\u00e9venir alors qu'il se changeait dans le vestiaire et l'a appel\u00e9 cul de Kirby Puckett. Aucun contexte n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni. Il est malheureux que le plaignant ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas expliquer l'origine de ce surnom dans sa preuve car cette d\u00e9cision aurait pu avoir un effet trompeur.\n[224] Dans sa preuve, le gend. Haney a situ\u00e9 la sc\u00e8ne en contexte et son explication n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite. Il a dit que le plaignant et lui avait une conversation joviale. Ils \u00e9taient heureux d'avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 appr\u00e9hender un suspect apr\u00e8s une chasse difficile. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il pouvait courir plus vite que le gend. Haney. Il semble tout \u00e0 fait logique qu'une personne exer\u00e7ant un r\u00f4le de formateur ait pu demander \u00e0 son \u00e9l\u00e8ve, sur un ton sarcastique, en d\u00e9fendant ses propres talents de coureur, s'il se prenait pour un athl\u00e8te professionnel. On a demand\u00e9 au gend. Haney en contre-interrogatoire pourquoi il avait choisi le nom d'un athl\u00e8te de race noire. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que Kirby Puckett est un athl\u00e8te qui, de par son gabarit et sa couleur, ressemblait au plaignant. \u00c0 mon avis, le choix d'un Noir comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de comparaison ne donne pas forc\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'expression une connotation biais\u00e9e ou d\u00e9favorable. Si le gend. Haney d\u00e9sirait citer le nom d'un athl\u00e8te, aurait-il n\u00e9cessairement fallu qu'il opte pour un athl\u00e8te de race blanche pour ne pas risquer de se faire taxer de raciste, comme le pr\u00e9tend le plaignant? Cela semble absurde.\n[225] Est-ce que l'ajout des mots cul (Ass) \u00e9voque de fa\u00e7on humiliante ce que le Dr Henry a appel\u00e9 une [TRADUCTION] caract\u00e9ristique physique bien connue des personnes d'origine africaine? Il existe certes de nos jours plusieurs expressions idiomatiques populaires renfermant le mot cul (Ass) qui ne font pas n\u00e9cessairement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au post\u00e9rieur d'une personne. Ainsi, l'expression anglaise smart-ass d\u00e9signe un smart aleck (Monsieur je-sais-tout) (voir le New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary), tandis que l'expression hard-ass (dur \u00e0 cuire) est une expression populaire servant \u00e0 d\u00e9signer [TRADUCTION] une personne qui suit ou applique rigoureusement les r\u00e8gles (American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition). Le gend. Haney a affirm\u00e9 qu'aucune raison particuli\u00e8re ne l'avait incit\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter les mots cul (Ass) dans le nom, bien qu'il ait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il associait la rapidit\u00e9 du plaignant et de Kirby Puckett comme coureurs \u00e0 un torse inf\u00e9rieur robuste. Il a cat\u00e9goriquement ni\u00e9 qu'il voulait ainsi faire allusion \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 la couleur du plaignant.\n[226] Le plaignant a soutenu que m\u00eame si ce n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 l'intention du gend. Haney, les pr\u00e9tendus st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes sous-tendaient de mani\u00e8re subconsciente ses commentaires. Le Dr Henry a d\u00e9crit dans son t\u00e9moignage un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qu'elle a appel\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] la blancheur dans le discours, expliquant que les personnes de race blanche ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas conscientes de leur classement racial comme Blancs et ne se rendent pas compte du fait qu'elles voient le monde \u00e0 travers leurs yeux de Blancs. \u00c0 mon avis, bien que l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le plaignant soit certes plausible, l'explication du gend. Haney, dans le contexte particulier de la conversation relat\u00e9e, semble tout aussi convaincante.\n[227] En ce qui touche la remarque du gend. Haney concernant la fa\u00e7on dont les hommes de race noire se serrent la main, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'elle illustrait ce que le Dr Henry a d\u00e9crit comme le discours dissociatif - nous et eux. Selon ses dires, elle prouverait que le gend. Haney per\u00e7oit les policiers de race noire de la GRC comme des \u00e9trangers. En revanche, le gend. St-Fleur n'a pas vu de ton raciste dans le commentaire. Peut-on en d\u00e9duire qu'il s'agissait d'une remarque comportant des connotations raciales? Je ne suis pas convaincu que l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le plaignant soit plus probable que celle donn\u00e9e par le gend. St-Fleur et la GRC. Je ne suis donc pas persuad\u00e9 que la remarque comportait des connotations raciales.\n[228] Le plaignant a sembl\u00e9 donner \u00e0 entendre que l'attitude froide du gend. Haney envers Mme Cerrato prouvait d'une certaine mani\u00e8re qu'il avait des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Je ne vois pas comment. L'explication du gend. Haney est raisonnable. Ses relations avec le plaignant \u00e9taient plus ou moins tendues lorsqu'elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Burnaby vers la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1996. Apr\u00e8s tout, c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 ce moment que le plaignant s'est plaint au cap. Fischer des m\u00e9thodes de formation du gend. Haney. Rien n'indique que cette explication est sans fondement ou est un pr\u00e9texte.\n[229] Il est difficile d'accepter la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant selon laquelle le gend. Haney et le gend. Carr, en chronom\u00e9trant ses activit\u00e9s, donnaient express\u00e9ment ou implicitement \u00e0 croire qu'il \u00e9tait paresseux et, par inf\u00e9rence, appliquaient un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement associ\u00e9 aux Noirs. C'est un fait qu'\u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Burnaby, le plaignant ne connaissait pas la r\u00e9gion et affichait des temps de r\u00e9ponse lents. En outre, plusieurs policiers de rang sup\u00e9rieur en plus du gend. Haney et du gend. Carr ont reconnu qu'il fallait beaucoup de temps au plaignant pour r\u00e9diger ses rapports. Le chronom\u00e9trage visait \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les temps de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant; en fait, cet objectif a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint. Cette pratique a peut-\u00eatre caus\u00e9 un stress suppl\u00e9mentaire au plaignant mais, comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il n'appartient pas au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si telle ou telle m\u00e9thode de formation est pertinente ou non. On pourrait dire la m\u00eame chose des pr\u00e9tendues vocif\u00e9rations du gend. Haney, r\u00e9action que ce dernier a ni\u00e9e et qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9e par aucun autre t\u00e9moin.\n[230] Par ailleurs, il convient d'ajouter que, selon la norme du programme de formation pratique, les formateurs n'\u00e9taient manifestement pas cens\u00e9s donner dans leurs rapports d'\u00e9valuation des exemples de conduite montrant que l'employ\u00e9 avait atteint la norme appropri\u00e9e. Ils ne devaient faire mention que des cas o\u00f9 le stagiaire n'avait pas atteint la norme ou avait affich\u00e9 un rendement sup\u00e9rieur. Je ne vois donc pas de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ce que les formateurs aient fait \u00e9tat des pr\u00e9tendues actions n\u00e9gatives dans leurs rapports. C'est ce \u00e0 quoi on s'attendait d'eux.\n[231] Le plaignant n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pr\u00e9cis qui pourrait permettre d'inf\u00e9rer que la discrimination a influenc\u00e9 le comportement du gend. Carr, si ce n'est le fait que ce dernier a continu\u00e9 d'appliquer les techniques pratiques et de formation qu'avait adopt\u00e9es le gend. Haney. De plus, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent que le gend. Carr (comme d'ailleurs le gend. Haney) ont fait des efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires pour aider le plaignant \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir sa FPR : le gend. Carr a enregistr\u00e9 sur bande sonore des sc\u00e9narios factuels \u00e0 l'intention du plaignant; le gend. Haney a donn\u00e9 chez lui des s\u00e9ances de formation sp\u00e9ciales. De plus, si on fait abstraction des soup\u00e7ons du plaignant, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne confirme la pr\u00e9tention voulant que le gend. Carr ait eu quoi que ce soit \u00e0 voir avec la r\u00e9daction par le gend. Marx d'une deuxi\u00e8me fiche de rendement 1004. Au contraire, la preuve montre que c'est le cap. Avery qui a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision.\n[232] La situation est quelque peu diff\u00e9rente dans le cas du dernier formateur, le gend. McDonald. Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que son portrait du gend. St-Fleur a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Cependant, je n'accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve. Il s'agit ici d'un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident aux connotations discriminatoires relativement \u00e9videntes. Cependant, le plaignant n'a pas relat\u00e9 l'incident \u00e0 qui que ce soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et il n'y a pas non plus fait allusion dans ses commentaires sur son rapport final d'\u00e9valuation. En outre, il n'a soulev\u00e9 l'incident ni dans sa plainte au CLO ni dans sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne, et il n'en a pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de cette derni\u00e8re. L'incident en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en f\u00e9vrier 2003 au moment de la divulgation des faits pertinents en l'esp\u00e8ce et, de surcro\u00eet, nous avons appris \u00e0 l'audience que le plaignant s'est soudainement souvenu \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute que l'auteur de la caricature et la personne d\u00e9peinte n'\u00e9taient pas ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans le document communiqu\u00e9 au stade de la divulgation. Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du dessin ne sont tout simplement pas cr\u00e9dibles.\n[233] La conversation du gend. McDonald avec le gend. St-Fleur o\u00f9 les deux hommes se sont demand\u00e9s lequel des deux \u00e9tait le plus sale s'apparente \u00e0 celle portant sur les hommes de race noire. Plusieurs interpr\u00e9tations sont possibles. Le gend. St-Fleur, qui a directement pris part \u00e0 la conversation, a affirm\u00e9 qu'il y a eu m\u00e9prise de la part du plaignant et que la remarque portait sur son gilet et non sur la couleur de sa peau.\n[234] Enfin, il y a les commentaires au sujet du programme d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi de la GRC. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que l'expression par le gend. McDonald d'une opinion \u00e0 ce sujet montre n\u00e9cessairement son intol\u00e9rance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'autrui. Le plaignant a admis que la discussion \u00e0 ce sujet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 civilis\u00e9e. L'interaction entre les politiques sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et les m\u00e9canismes traditionnels de dotation est un sujet qui revient souvent dans les conversations. En fait, les dispositions et l'application de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, L.R.C. ch. E-5, font elles-m\u00eames l'objet d'un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la Chambre des communes tous les cinq ans (art. 44). Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas qu'on puisse conclure que les commentaires du gend. McDonald \u00e0 ce sujet d\u00e9notent une tendance raciste ou discriminatoire.\n[235] L'insp. Schlecker a formul\u00e9 plusieurs remarques au sujet de l'appartenance du plaignant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible, tant dans la documentation qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours de l'enqu\u00eate de la Commission que dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ses commentaires illustrent certes le discours dissociatif (nous et eux). Le fait qu'il semble croire \u00e0 l'existence de Canadiens ordinaires d'une couleur ou origine particuli\u00e8re est d\u00e9concertant. Il est \u00e9tonnant \u00e9galement qu'un membre de la GRC ayant autant de prestige et d'exp\u00e9rience puisse qualifier les gens d'ascendance africaine de personnes de couleur (coloured), faisant ainsi fi de la signification de ce terme et de l'histoire regrettable qui se cache derri\u00e8re. N\u00e9anmoins, il ressort clairement de la preuve que, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision formelle de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l'insp. Schlecker, ce dernier s'en est simplement remis, en fait, aux opinions des formateurs et superviseurs du plaignant ainsi que du cap. Cousins. De toute \u00e9vidence, il n'a pas jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans le processus.\n[236] L'intim\u00e9e a soutenu qu'on ne peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 partir des exp\u00e9riences du gend. St-Fleur et du gend. Knight. Le gend. St-Fleur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait un conflit de personnalit\u00e9 avec son formateur, le gend. Marx, et qu'ils ne s'entendaient pas sur la mani\u00e8re d'exercer le m\u00e9tier de policier. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a lui-m\u00eame demand\u00e9 qu'on lui affecte un nouveau formateur avec lequel il a \u00e9tabli de meilleurs rapports. Il a finalement r\u00e9ussi sa FPR. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait pas que le gend. Marx ait fait montre d'une attitude discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit. Le gend. Marx et lui n'\u00e9taient tout simplement pas sur la m\u00eame longueur d'onde.\n[237] Fait int\u00e9ressant, le nouveau formateur du gend. Knight \u00e9tait le gend. McDonald. C'est sous sa tutelle que le gend. Knight a r\u00e9ussi sa FPR. Le gend. Knight a trouv\u00e9 le gend. McDonald tr\u00e8s juste et d\u00e9tendu. Il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise de travailler avec son formateur. La formation du gend. Knight a d\u00fb \u00eatre prolong\u00e9e parce qu'on a jug\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les premiers six mois qu'il avait encore des lacunes sur le plan de la r\u00e9daction des rapports, \u00e0 cause peut-\u00eatre de sa dyslexie. L'intim\u00e9e a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que s'il y a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment commun entre le plaignant et le gend. St-Fleur qui avait peut-\u00eatre influenc\u00e9 leur rendement au cours de leur FPR, ce n'\u00e9tait pas la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la couleur. Tous deux \u00e9taient francophones et travaillaient dans un milieu unilingue anglais, ce qui les d\u00e9savantageait nettement. Toutefois, que cela ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas ou non, l'exp\u00e9rience des deux autres policiers et celle du plaignant ne comportent pas, \u00e0 mon avis, suffisamment de similitudes pour permettre de tirer quelque inf\u00e9rence que ce soit. Tout compte fait, il existe une diff\u00e9rence fondamentale entre les deux autres recrues et le plaignant : ils ont r\u00e9ussi leur FPR et le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9 la sienne.\n[238] Est-ce que de subtiles odeurs de discrimination se d\u00e9gagent de toute cette preuve? \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse est non. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant ne rendent pas l'inf\u00e9rence de discrimination plus probable que l'inf\u00e9rence inverse. Au contraire, compte tenu de ce qui a transpir\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du plaignant de Burnaby, je suis persuad\u00e9 que les explications fournies par l'intim\u00e9e sont raisonnables et compl\u00e8tes.\n[239] La demande d'emploi de policier que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au SPCUM apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles cit\u00e9es par la GRC. Le SPCUM en est arriv\u00e9 aux m\u00eames conclusions, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il ne connaissait absolument pas les \u00e9valuations du plaignant et les circonstances entourant son d\u00e9part de la GRC. Apr\u00e8s l'avoir interview\u00e9 et soumis \u00e0 des tests, le jury de s\u00e9lection a constat\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait trop rigide dans ses d\u00e9cisions, qu'il appliquait les lois \u00e0 la lettre sans tenir compte de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments (y compris l'avis d'un coll\u00e8gue) et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas ouvert aux critiques. Le Dr Girard en est arriv\u00e9e ind\u00e9pendamment \u00e0 des conclusions semblables apr\u00e8s l'examen psychom\u00e9trique du plaignant. Ses conclusions pr\u00e9sentent d'\u00e9tonnantes similitudes avec celles tir\u00e9es par chacun des trois formateurs du plaignant, sans parler des autres membres de la GRC qui ont fait des observations au sujet de son rendement.\n[240] En d\u00e9pit du fait que le plaignant n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par plusieurs autres services de police, l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre particuli\u00e8rement l'accent \u00e0 l'audience sur la demande d'emploi que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au service de police de l'\u00cele-Perrot. Le plaignant s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen d'embauche sans avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Comme il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen, il a \u00e9chou\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e a soutenu qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 logique de s'attendre \u00e0 ce qu'un examen administr\u00e9 par un service de police municipal du Qu\u00e9bec porterait sur les lois provinciales. Le fait que le plaignant n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conscient de la chose et ne se soit pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9note le manque de jugement qu'avaient constat\u00e9 ses formateurs et superviseurs \u00e0 Burnaby.\n[241] M\u00eame l'employeur actuel du plaignant, ADM, a relev\u00e9 certaines lacunes relativement \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 r\u00e9diger des rapports (lesquelles avaient d'ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cel\u00e9es \u00e9galement par la GRC au d\u00e9but de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de prolongation) et \u00e0 ses r\u00e9ponses concernant un sc\u00e9nario de crime.\n[242] Par ailleurs, on trouve \u00e9galement apr\u00e8s le retour du plaignant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al des preuves du manque d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 que la GRC avait, selon ses all\u00e9gations, constat\u00e9 au cours de la FPR. Il n'a jamais inform\u00e9 aucun de ses employeurs \u00e9ventuels ou r\u00e9els des v\u00e9ritables circonstances relatives \u00e0 son emploi au sein de la GRC. Je peux comprendre l'explication que le plaignant a donn\u00e9e au cours de son t\u00e9moignage. Sa situation financi\u00e8re \u00e9tait pr\u00e9caire et il craignait qu'une telle divulgation compromette ses possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi. Toutefois, je n'oublie pas qu'au moins deux de ses employeurs avaient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'une fausse d\u00e9claration entra\u00eenerait presque automatiquement le rejet de la candidature. Il a n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de dissimuler l'information.\n[243] Il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans Folch qu'on devrait faire preuve d'une plus grande circonspection \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions d'embauche prises en fonction de crit\u00e8res subjectifs. J'ai examin\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s les d\u00e9cisions de la GRC, et je suis convaincu que l'explication quant au refus d'embaucher le plaignant est raisonnable, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9valuations ind\u00e9pendantes, mais \u00e9tonnamment similaires, des autres employeurs. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la couleur du plaignant ait jou\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9chec de sa FPR.\n[244] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'il est peu probable qu'on exerce ouvertement au Canada des mesures discriminatoires, particuli\u00e8rement au sein d'organismes comme la GRC. Un tribunal des droits de la personne doit in\u00e9luctablement enqu\u00eater sur toutes les circonstances en vue de d\u00e9celer la pr\u00e9sence d'odeurs inf\u00e2mes mais subtiles de discrimination. Je me suis livr\u00e9 \u00e0 cet exercice en l'esp\u00e8ce et j'ai conclu que la preuve circonstancielle de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui touche la conduite des formateurs et d'autres membres de rang sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 Burnaby, \u00e9tait au mieux \u00e9quivoque. Le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli si la partie plaignante ne d\u00e9montre pas que l'inf\u00e9rence qu'elle voudrait qu'on tire est plus probable que celle propos\u00e9e par la partie intim\u00e9e. En l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis persuad\u00e9 que non seulement l'explication de la GRC est plus probable, mais aussi qu'elle est la cause unique et v\u00e9ritable du cong\u00e9diement du plaignant. La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la couleur n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nD. Plainte aux termes de l'article 14 [245] Aux termes de l'article 14 de la Loi, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[246] Le harc\u00e8lement jug\u00e9 illicite aux termes de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une conduite non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour la victime (Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la p. 1284; Rampersadsingh c. Wignall (no 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237, au par. 40 (T.C.D.P.)). Dans Canada (RHC) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, [1999] 3 C.F. 653, aux par. 29 \u00e0 50 (C.F., 1re inst.) (Franke), la juge Tremblay-Lamer d\u00e9finit le crit\u00e8re servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il y a harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la Loi. Pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte, il faut prouver ce qui suit :\nIl faut montrer que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite de la partie intim\u00e9e est li\u00e9e au motif de distinction illicite invoqu\u00e9 dans la plainte (en l'esp\u00e8ce, la couleur du plaignant). Cette d\u00e9monstration doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances entourant l'affaire, en gardant \u00e0 l'esprit les normes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il faut prouver que les actes jug\u00e9s r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles \u00e9taient importuns. Afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il s'agissait d'actes importuns, on tient compte de la r\u00e9action de la partie plaignante au moment o\u00f9 les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement se sont produits et on d\u00e9termine si celle-ci a express\u00e9ment montr\u00e9, par son comportement, que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait importune. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire dans tous les cas de d\u00e9terminer si un refus verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9; le fait d'omettre \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires de l'auteur du harc\u00e8lement constitue pour ce dernier une indication que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. La norme \u00e0 appliquer en vue d'appr\u00e9cier la conduite est celle de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances.\nPour qu'il y ait harc\u00e8lement, il faut habituellement la pr\u00e9sence d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; toutefois, dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Ainsi, une seule agression physique peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement, mais une plaisanterie vulgaire, m\u00eame si elle est de mauvais go\u00fbt, ne suffira g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle est moins susceptible, \u00e0 elle seule, de cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail d\u00e9favorable. On se fonde \u00e9galement sur le crit\u00e8re objectif de la personne raisonnable pour \u00e9valuer cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment. (iv) Enfin, si un employeur fait l'objet d'une plainte ayant trait \u00e0 la conduite d'un ou de plusieurs de ses employ\u00e9s, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que la victime du harc\u00e8lement avise, si possible, l'employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante. Cette exigence existe lorsqu'il y a chez l'employeur un service du personnel ainsi qu'une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et v\u00e9ritable en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, y compris des m\u00e9canismes de redressement appropri\u00e9s.\nE. La conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle li\u00e9e \u00e0 la couleur du plaignant? [247] Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime \u00e0 la fois d'un harc\u00e8lement direct, plus cibl\u00e9, ainsi que d'un harc\u00e8lement plus vaste et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il soutient que l'emploi des surnoms OBO et cul de Kirby Puckett constituait nettement un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la couleur. Par ailleurs, il pr\u00e9tend que la fa\u00e7on s\u00e9v\u00e8re dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 pendant sa formation, les \u00e9valuations injustes et la micro-gestion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de sa FPR ont globalement constitu\u00e9 une autre forme de harc\u00e8lement.\n[248] J'ai comment\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment l'emploi du terme OBO. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 qu'il comporte une connotation raciale. Dans Stadnyk c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration) (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. D\/290, au par. 25, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 que si l'auteur de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement est une femme, la norme de la personne raisonnable devrait \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la norme d'une femme raisonnable. La Cour a fait remarquer que le tribunal a entendu les t\u00e9moignages d'experts qui ont expliqu\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence entre un homme ou une personne raisonnable et une femme raisonnable quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de percevoir les choses. En l'esp\u00e8ce, nous ne disposons que de la preuve du Dr Henry, une sp\u00e9cialiste reconnue dans le domaine du racisme, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais entendu parler de l'existence d'un lien entre le terme OBO et les ventes aux ench\u00e8res d'esclaves. Toutefois, elle a indiqu\u00e9 que ce surnom \u00e9voquait un manque d'intelligence, ce qui correspond \u00e0 un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype raciste associ\u00e9 aux personnes de race noire. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les v\u00e9ritables circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce ne corroborent pas cette pr\u00e9tention. \u00c0 l'instar d'autres sobriquets utilis\u00e9s dans la GRC, ce surnom se voulait un signe de familiarit\u00e9 et de camaraderie. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, comme je l'expliquerai plus loin, les conclusions du Dr Henry \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur une connaissance partielle des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce, ce qui en diminue nettement la valeur aux yeux du Tribunal. Je suis convaincu que l'emploi de ce surnom n'est pas raisonnablement li\u00e9 au fait d'\u00eatre une personne de race noire.\n[249] D'autre part, je suis d'avis que la preuve corrobore l'argument voulant qu'une personne raisonnable percevrait le surnom cul de Kirby Puckett comme s'appliquant \u00e0 une personne ayant la peau noire, et ce, quelle qu'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention du gend. Haney. Je suis convaincu que Kirby Puckett est un joueur de base-ball d'origine afro-am\u00e9ricaine qui, outre ses qualit\u00e9s athl\u00e9tiques, \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour son gros gabarit et sa musculature, et notamment pour ce que certains consid\u00e9raient \u00eatre un post\u00e9rieur plut\u00f4t robuste. Au regard de certains st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes racistes associ\u00e9s aux traits physiques des personnes d'ascendance africaine, il serait raisonnable qu'un Noir qui entend un tel surnom pense qu'on fait allusion \u00e0 la couleur de sa peau.\n[250] Cependant, je ne pense pas qu'une personne raisonnable, dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, percevrait la micro-gestion de la formation du plaignant comme \u00e9tant li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa couleur. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le rendement du plaignant laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, et l'employeur, particuli\u00e8rement au cours de la p\u00e9riode de stage, avait droit de recourir aux moyens jug\u00e9s opportuns, tant pour former la recrue que pour l'\u00e9valuer.\n[251] Comme je viens de l'indiquer, il est important \u00e0 mon avis de faire remarquer qu'un grand nombre des assertions que le Dr Henry a faites au cours de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur une connaissance partielle des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. Avant qu'elle r\u00e9dige son rapport et t\u00e9moigne, on ne lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que quelques documents, notamment le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission et un sommaire \u00e9tabli par l'avocat de la Commission. Il convient de noter qu'elle n'a eu la chance de prendre connaissance d'aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ayant trait aux demandes d'emploi faites par le plaignant apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. En outre, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 un des premiers t\u00e9moins \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en faveur du plaignant et, bien s\u00fbr, elle n'a entendu aucun des t\u00e9moignages concernant le rendement du plaignant au cours de sa FPR, ceux-ci ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e plus tard durant l'audience. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal a des doutes \u00e0 propos de nombreuses conclusions formul\u00e9es par le Dr Henry dans son rapport et son t\u00e9moignage. Elle a tir\u00e9 beaucoup de conclusions en se fondant sur une information incompl\u00e8te, tout en ayant parfois tendance \u00e0 usurper le r\u00f4le du Tribunal.\n[252] Le m\u00eame genre de remarque s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 une partie du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Girard. Non seulement a-t-elle expliqu\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage ce qu'elle avait observ\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite des tests administr\u00e9s en 1998 pour le compte du SPCUM, mais l'intim\u00e9e l'a aussi pri\u00e9e de tirer certaines conclusions relativement aux comp\u00e9tences du plaignant. Ces conclusions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es en se fondant, d'une part, sur les r\u00e9sultats de tests psychom\u00e9triques administr\u00e9s au plaignant par le CN et, d'autre part, sur sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite pendant son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Burnaby et par la suite. Le Dr Girard n'a pas eu la chance d'entendre tous les t\u00e9moignages en l'esp\u00e8ce. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les faits sur lesquels elle a fond\u00e9 certaines de ses hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e9taient incomplets. J'ai donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte de ces conclusions particuli\u00e8res.\nF. La conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle importune? [253] Le seul comportement qui, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 la couleur du plaignant est l'utilisation du surnom cul de Kirby Puckett. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le gend. Haney a affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant n'avait montr\u00e9 aucun signe ext\u00e9rieur donnant \u00e0 penser que ce surnom lui d\u00e9plaisait. Au contraire, il riait et rendait la pareille \u00e0 son formateur en l'appelant Dumbo. Le gend. Carr a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait vu le plaignant employer lui-m\u00eame ce surnom dans des messages \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec le gend. St-Fleur. Lorsqu'il a expliqu\u00e9 l'origine du surnom au gend. Carr, le plaignant ne semblait pas \u00eatre offusqu\u00e9 par son utilisation.\n[254] Le gend. Haney a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que si le plaignant lui avait dit que ce surnom l'offusquait, il aurait aussit\u00f4t cess\u00e9 de l'utiliser. Le gend. Christine Briand, qui est francophone, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de sa carri\u00e8re, quelqu'un l'a appel\u00e9e Frenchie. Elle a formul\u00e9 des objections \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'utilisation de ce surnom, et on a aussit\u00f4t cess\u00e9 de l'appeler ainsi.\n[255] Le plaignant a soutenu que, vu la nature asym\u00e9trique de sa relation avec ses formateurs, entre les mains desquelles reposait son avenir dans la GRC, il n'avait d'autre choix que de s'abstenir de manifester ext\u00e9rieurement des signes de d\u00e9sapprobation. C'est une explication satisfaisante dans les circonstances. Il est raisonnable qu'un employ\u00e9 en d\u00e9but de carri\u00e8re, particuli\u00e8rement durant sa p\u00e9riode de stage, soit r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 mettre en p\u00e9ril son emploi en protestant contre les faits et gestes de son sup\u00e9rieur (voir Bouvier c. Metro Express (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/313, au par. 65 (T.C.D.P.); Woiden c. Lynn (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296, au par. 104 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[256] Le gend. Haney pr\u00e9tend que le choix du surnom n'\u00e9tait pas motiv\u00e9 par des consid\u00e9rations racistes ou discriminatoires; le plaignant pr\u00e9tend le contraire. Toutefois, aux fins de l'analyse de la question du harc\u00e8lement, la nature du surnom aux yeux du formateur n'est pas pertinente. Le surnom doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 au regard d'une norme diff\u00e9rente, celle de la personne raisonnable. \u00c0 mon avis, une personne raisonnable comprendrait qu'il est peu probable qu'un Noir priserait une remarque pouvant \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme ridiculisant son derri\u00e8re dans une optique raciste.\nG. La conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle de nature suffisamment grave ou r\u00e9p\u00e9titive? [257] Selon la preuve, le terme a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 plus d'une fois. Au dire du gend. Haney, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 plus de cinq fois. Le plaignant n'a pas donn\u00e9 de chiffre pr\u00e9cis, affirmant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e. Cependant, son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard m'a paru in\u00e9gal. Il a pris soin de pr\u00e9ciser que le surnom OBO a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 constamment, tout au cours de sa FPR, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment par de nombreux t\u00e9moins, mais il n'a pas fait d'affirmation similaire en ce qui touche l'expression cul de Kirby Puckett. Si on fait exception du t\u00e9moignage du gend. Carr auquel je viens de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, aucun autre t\u00e9moin n'a dit avoir constat\u00e9 qu'on surnommait ainsi le plaignant. Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, je suis convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le gend. Haney n'a employ\u00e9 ce surnom qu'\u00e0 quelques reprises, comme il l'a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 est survenu l'incident \u00e0 l'origine de son invention (c.-\u00e0-d. dans le quatri\u00e8me mois de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de FPR du plaignant).\n[258] Lorsqu'elle prend la forme d'insinuations, de plaisanteries de mauvais go\u00fbt et de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes racistes, la conduite reproch\u00e9e doit \u00eatre de nature persistante et fr\u00e9quente pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Une seule et unique insinuation raciste, si grave soit-elle, ne constitue pas en soi du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi (voir Rampersadsingh (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) au par. 54; Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/367, au par. 212). En l'esp\u00e8ce, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 qu'une personne raisonnable jugerait que ces cinq ou six occurrences au cours d'une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode repr\u00e9sentaient une fr\u00e9quence ou un degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 suffisants pour empoisonner le milieu de travail du plaignant et constituer une forme r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la Loi.\n[259] Je ne doute pas un instant que le plaignant se soit vraiment senti mal \u00e0 l'aise dans son milieu de travail et qu'il en soit m\u00eame venu \u00e0 appr\u00e9hender d'aller travailler avec le gend. Haney, par crainte surtout d'essuyer des critiques. Il est fort probable qu'il consid\u00e9rait son milieu de travail comme empoisonn\u00e9, mais je suis convaincu que ce n'est pas en raison d'un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la couleur. C'est plut\u00f4t parce que sa formation ne s'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9roul\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9vu, qu'il entretenait de mauvais rapports avec son formatteur et aussi parce qu'il n'avait pas obtenu les succ\u00e8s escompt\u00e9s. C'est malheureux, mais je suis convaincu que sa couleur n'explique en rien les difficult\u00e9s qu'il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es.\nH. Notification de l'employeur [260] M\u00eame si le surnom cul de Kirby Puckett \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une forme de harc\u00e8lement, le plaignant n'a pas inform\u00e9 ses superviseurs ou un autre officier sup\u00e9rieur de la GRC du comportement jug\u00e9 offensant. La GRC disposait d'une vaste politique et infrastructure de lutte contre le harc\u00e8lement pour r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes de cette nature. La politique \u00e9tait assortie de toute une panoplie de m\u00e9canismes de redressement appropri\u00e9s. Cependant, pour enclencher ce processus, encore fallait-il que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e victime fasse conna\u00eetre le plus t\u00f4t possible ses objections au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 auteur du harc\u00e8lement. Si le probl\u00e8me ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9solu de cette mani\u00e8re, la victime devait signaler le harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 ses superviseurs. Si le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 auteur du harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait un superviseur, il fallait que la victime signale le harc\u00e8lement au superviseur de l'auteur du harc\u00e8lement ou \u00e0 son chef de section. Les modalit\u00e9s d'application de cette politique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les membres de la GRC, y compris aux recrues.\n[261] La seule plainte qu'ait formul\u00e9e le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au cap. Fischer durant un party de No\u00ebl. Cette plainte avait trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e utilisation par le gend. Haney de m\u00e9thodes de formation s\u00e9v\u00e8res. Le plaignant n'a pas fait allusion \u00e0 des surnoms ou des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes dont l'usage \u00e9tait r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Bien que le plaignant ait exprim\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9occupations dans un cadre plut\u00f4t informel, le cap. Fischer en a touch\u00e9 mot \u00e0 son propre superviseur, le serg. Watts, ainsi qu'au gend. Haney. Par la suite, le plaignant s'est vu offrir l'occasion de travailler avec un nouveau formateur. Il a refus\u00e9 l'offre.\n[262] Le plaignant aurait pu suivre la m\u00eame d\u00e9marche pour protester contre l'emploi du surnom qu'il jugeait blessant ! cul de Kirby Puckett. Il ne l'a pas fait. Il n'a pas non plus fait appel aux services de son sous-repr\u00e9sentant aupr\u00e8s du PRDRF, le cap. Allen. Le plaignant a dit que ce n'est que lors de la premi\u00e8re prolongation de sa FPR qu'il a eu vent des services offerts par le PRDRF. Pourtant, de nombreux membres de la GRC qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience ont confirm\u00e9 que tous les membres, y compris les recrues, sont sensibilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'existence du PRDRF d\u00e8s leur arriv\u00e9e au d\u00e9tachement.\n[263] Compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'esp\u00e8ce et du fait qu'il n'a aucunement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du harc\u00e8lement, l'employeur ne saurait \u00eatre tenu responsable de celui-ci.\n[264] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-haut, la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant voulant que la GRC ait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination sous forme de harc\u00e8lement n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nIII. CONCLUSION [265] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e et est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Le 16 juin 1998, Aleta Gaucher a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte par laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes ont exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille et l'\u00e2ge en omettant de lui accorder une promotion et de continuer \u00e0 l'employer.\n[2] Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2004, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour fins d'instruction.\n[3] Le 13 janvier 2005, le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission en vue de modifier la plainte afin d'y inclure des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les Forces canadiennes, en contravention de l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, ont exerc\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des promotions et du maintien en poste du personnel, des politiques et des actes discriminatoires qui ont eu des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables sur les femmes, les femmes autochtones et les femmes mono-parentales.\n[4] Lors de leur pr\u00e9paration pour l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les parties se sont heurt\u00e9es \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la communication de documents. Bien qu'une certaine communication de documents ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu, la Commission et Mme Gaucher ne sont pas satisfaites de l'\u00e9tendue de cette communication. L'une et l'autre ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d'obtenir la communication d'autres documents en all\u00e9guant qu'elles ont besoin d'un plus grand nombre de documents de la part des Forces canadiennes pour pr\u00e9parer leur cause.\nI. LE CONTEXTE [5] Mme Gaucher s'est engag\u00e9e dans les Forces canadiennes en f\u00e9vrier 1975 en tant que membre de la police militaire. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 promue du grade de soldat \u00e0 celui de caporal dans la police militaire en 1979. Elle est devenue admissible \u00e0 une promotion de caporal-chef en 1981. En janvier 1988, Mme Gaucher a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre m\u00e9tier et elle est devenue de nouveau admissible \u00e0 une promotion de 1990 \u00e0 1996. En 1996, elle a quitt\u00e9 les Forces canadiennes.\n[6] Le syst\u00e8me de promotion dans les Forces canadiennes est complexe. Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il est suffisant de mentionner la preuve du t\u00e9moin des Forces canadiennes selon laquelle, au cours des p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, tous les membres qui \u00e9taient admissibles \u00e0 une promotion \u00e9taient d'abord \u00e9valu\u00e9s et not\u00e9s par leur unit\u00e9 sur le fondement de certains documents contenus dans leur dossier du personnel. La note et d'autres documents contenus dans le dossier \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral national \u00e0 Ottawa o\u00f9 un dossier du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite \u00e9tait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 pour chaque candidat. Le dossier du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite est un ensemble de documents qui incluent des rapports sur le rendement, des rapports de cours, un dossier du personnel, des sommaires et des lettres de recommandation.\n[7] Un organisme connu sous le nom de Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite \u00e9valuait ensuite les candidats \u00e0 une promotion sur le fondement de leur dossier du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite. \u00c0 la fin de son examen des candidats admissibles dans une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, le Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite d\u00e9livrait un rapport du Conseil qui expliquait, dans une certaine mesure, le processus suivi pour l'\u00e9tablissement de la liste des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite. Le Conseil d\u00e9livrait \u00e9galement une liste des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite qui classait les candidats dans l'ordre de la concordance de leurs aptitudes pour une promotion.\nA. Les requ\u00eates [8] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne demande une ordonnance en vue d'obtenir ce qui suit :\nTous les documents pertinents au processus de s\u00e9lection du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pour toutes les ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles Mme Gaucher \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 une promotion, y compris mais sans s'y limiter ce qui suit :\nLes rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite; les sommaires des dossiers du personnel du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pour tous les candidats qui s'\u00e9taient mieux class\u00e9s que Mme Gaucher; pour chaque ann\u00e9e, les dossiers du personnel pour la p\u00e9riode pertinente de tous les candidats qui s'\u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s.\nTous les documents se rapportant aux pratiques et aux politiques des Forces canadiennes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'embauche et du maintien en poste des membres autochtones.\n[9] Dans sa requ\u00eate, Mme Gaucher demande une ordonnance en vue d'obtenir ce qui suit :\nLes dossiers du personnel complets de cinq individus nomm\u00e9s qui ont obtenu des promotions et qui n'\u00e9taient soi-disant pas plus qualifi\u00e9s que l'\u00e9tait Mme Gaucher; les coordonn\u00e9es des personnes que Mme Gaucher a l'intention d'appeler comme t\u00e9moins au cours de l'audience.\nII. DROIT ET ANALYSE [10] Le crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la communication de documents est celui de savoir si on peut soutenir que le document est pertinent. Pour que le document soit pertinent, il faut qu'il y ait un certain lien entre le document et un fait en litige (Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42).\n[11] Le seuil quant \u00e0 la pertinence all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la tendance est maintenant orient\u00e9e vers une plus grande, et non une moins grande, communication (Syndicat des communications, de l'\u00e9nergie et du papier, Femmes-Action c. Bell Canada, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, no 2, dat\u00e9e du 9 f\u00e9vrier 2000, dossier no T503\/2098; Neusch c. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation), [2002] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 11, aux paragraphes 72 et 73). Toutefois, il est important que la demande de communication n'\u00e9quivaille pas \u00e0 une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache (CEP c. Bell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\n[12] Ayant ces principes en t\u00eate, je vais examiner chacune des demandes de communication.\n(1) Tous les documents pertinents au processus de s\u00e9lection du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pour toutes les ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles Mme Gaucher \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 une promotion\n(i) Les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite et les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite [13] Les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite et les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite pour toutes les p\u00e9riodes au cours desquelles Mme Gaucher \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 une promotion sont clairement pertinents quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Ils fournissent une indication du rang qu'occupait Mme Gaucher sur la liste qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour prendre des d\u00e9cisions quant aux promotions de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du processus utilis\u00e9 pour la s\u00e9lection des candidats pour les promotions.\n[14] Les Forces canadiennes d\u00e9clarent qu'elles communiqueront les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite et les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite pour la p\u00e9riode de 1993 \u00e0 1996. Cependant, selon le t\u00e9moin des Forces canadiennes, le lieutenant-commander Tracey Lonsdale, les rapports du Conseil et les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite ne sont pas disponibles quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de promotion de 1981 \u00e0 1988 et pour l'ann\u00e9e 1990. La question de savoir si les rapports et les listes sont disponibles pour la p\u00e9riode de 1991 \u00e0 1993 ne ressortait pas clairement du dossier.\n[15] Si les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite et les listes sont disponibles pour la p\u00e9riode de 1991 \u00e0 1993 et qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s, j'ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de les communiquer.\n[16] Au cours de l'audience \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate, l'avocat de la Commission et l'avocat de Mme Gaucher ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'il \u00e9tait possible de reconstituer les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite et les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pour la p\u00e9riode de 1981 \u00e0 1988 et pour l'ann\u00e9e 1990, en utilisant les documents contenus dans les dossiers du personnel (qui sont conserv\u00e9s pendant une p\u00e9riode beaucoup plus longue) et d'autres renseignements du service du personnel des Forces canadiennes. Les Forces canadiennes ont mentionn\u00e9 qu'une reconstitution serait tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 faire, si ce n'est impossible.\n[17] Je ne vais pas demander aux Forces canadiennes de reconstituer les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite et des rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite qui ne sont plus en leur possession. Le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit qu'une partie doit fournir des copies des documents qu'elle a en sa possession. Le sens ordinaire des mots en sa possession donne \u00e0 penser que les parties ne sont pas tenues de cr\u00e9er des documents aux fins de la communication. Effectivement, c'est la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle le tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 des dispositions similaires contenues dans ses r\u00e8gles. (Voir par exemple la d\u00e9cision Auchoybaur c. Walcan Seafood Ltd., 2005 BCHRT 35, au paragraphe 13).\n(ii) Les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite et les dossiers du personnel [18] Au cours de l'audience, l'avocat de la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame s'il ne renon\u00e7ait pas \u00e0 sa demande \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de tous les candidats qui se sont mieux class\u00e9s que Mme Gaucher, il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter une ordonnance visant la communication des dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite que pour les candidats qui avaient obtenu une promotion au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[19] L'avocat de la Commission a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que cette communication pourrait \u00eatre satisfaisante et que si elle ne l'\u00e9tait pas, il renouvellerait sa demande de communication des dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de tous les candidats qui s'\u00e9taient mieux class\u00e9s que Mme Gaucher au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Pour \u00eatre clair, l'avocat de la Commission a en outre mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'insisterait pas pour obtenir la communication des dossiers du personnel complets de tous les candidats qui s'\u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s.\n[20] Il y a apparemment environ quatre-vingt-trois (83) individus qui ont obtenu une promotion au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1991 \u00e0 1996. L'avocate des Forces canadiennes a pr\u00e9tendu que seul le dossier du candidat qui, chaque ann\u00e9e, a obtenu la derni\u00e8re promotion pouvait \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre pertinent.\n[21] Je ne partage pas son opinion. \u00c0 mon avis, la pertinence des dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de tous les candidats qui ont obtenu une promotion avant Mme Gaucher se rapporte aux portions individuelles et syst\u00e9miques de sa plainte.\n[22] Premi\u00e8rement, dans un cas traitant de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge dans le processus de promotion des Forces canadiennes, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les documents utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9valuer le m\u00e9rite de toutes les personnes par rapport auxquelles le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e9valu\u00e9 sont clairement pertinents (Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 41, au paragraphe 129, confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 2005 CAF 154). La raison de la position \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est que les documents constituent le moyen par lequel le plaignant et la Commission tentent habituellement d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Bien que dans l'affaire Morris, le Tribunal ait en fin de compte conclu que les documents n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires pour que la Commission et le plaignant \u00e9tablissent une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la pertinence des documents contenus dans les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite n'est pas ni\u00e9e.\n[23] De plus, les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de tous les candidats qui se sont qualifi\u00e9s sont manifestement pertinents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des explications de l'intim\u00e9e quant aux raisons pour lesquelles la plaignante n'a pas obtenu une promotion.\n[24] Finalement la pertinence des rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite repose \u00e9galement sur le potentiel qu'ils ont de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des pratiques ou des politiques qui contreviennent \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Loi. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la Commission et Mme Gaucher n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment claires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des pratiques et politiques auxquelles elles renvoient. Cependant, les Forces canadiennes elles-m\u00eames ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans leur Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'elles ont pris toutes les mesures raisonnables pour \u00e9liminer la discrimination dans leurs politiques et pratiques d'embauche, de promotion et de maintien en poste. Par cons\u00e9quent, les renvois faits par les Forces canadiennes elles-m\u00eames aux politiques et pratiques qui ont pu \u00eatre discriminatoires \u00e9tablissent le lien entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les faits en litige.\n[25] Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent que les inconv\u00e9nients associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la production des dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite surpassent l'utilit\u00e9 qu'auront les documents dans le processus d'audience du Tribunal. Une fois de plus, je ne partage pas l'opinion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'importance d'une communication compl\u00e8te \u00e0 toutes les parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e par de nombreuses cours de justice et de nombreux tribunaux (voir par exemple Ontario (Human Rights Commission) c. Dofasco Inc. (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 693 (C.A. de l'Ontario), et Neusch c. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation), [2002] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 11).\n[26] En outre, dans son affidavit, la personne qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les Forces canadiennes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela prendrait approximativement deux \u00e0 trois mois pour fournir les dossiers du personnel des individus, environ cinq cents, qui se sont mieux class\u00e9s que Mme Gaucher sur les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite. Cependant, lors du contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu que cela prendrait moins de temps pour fournir les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite des quatre-vingt-trois individus qui ont obtenu des promotions entre 1991 et 1996. Par cons\u00e9quent, une demande visant la production de ces dossiers ne serait pas, \u00e0 mon avis, un fardeau ind\u00fbment lourd.\n[27] Il reste le probl\u00e8me de la communication de dossiers pour la p\u00e9riode de 1981 \u00e0 1988 et pour l'ann\u00e9e 1990 pour lesquelles ni les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite ni les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite ne sont disponibles. Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re l'opinion que j'ai exprim\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment selon laquelle les Forces canadiennes devraient continuer \u00e0 faire de leur mieux pour trouver et communiquer les documents se rapportant aux membres qui ont obtenu des promotions dans les groupes professionnels desquels Mme Gaucher faisait partie au cours des p\u00e9riodes pertinentes.\n(2) Tous les documents se rapportant aux pratiques et aux politiques des Forces canadiennes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'embauche et du maintien en poste des membres autochtones\n[28] Dans leurs observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, les Forces canadiennes ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elles modifieraient leur Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour communiquer et produire des documents additionnels se rapportant \u00e0 l'embauche et au maintien en poste des membres autochtones. Aucune autre question n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais simplement rappeler aux Forces canadiennes qu'elles demeurent tenues de communiquer tout document se rapportant \u00e0 cette question et plus particuli\u00e8rement les documents qui se rapportent au point qu'elles ont soulev\u00e9 au paragraphe 1(n) de leur Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nIII. ORDONNANCE A. Ordonnance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate de la Commission\nDans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ne l'ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait, et dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont encore disponibles, le Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de communiquer les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite et les rapports du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pertinents au rang qu'occupait Mme Gaucher pour obtenir une promotion au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1991 \u00e0 1996. Le Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de faire de leur mieux pour trouver et communiquer les documents se rapportant au processus de s\u00e9lection du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite pour toutes les autres ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles Mme Gaucher \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 une promotion. Le Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de communiquer les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de tous les candidats inscrits sur les listes des candidats par ordre de m\u00e9rite qui ont obtenu une promotion au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1991 \u00e0 1996. Le Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de faire de leur mieux pour trouver et communiquer tous les documents se rapportant aux membres qui ont obtenu des promotions dans les groupes professionnels dont Mme Gaucher faisait partie au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 1981 \u00e0 1988 et pour l'ann\u00e9e 1990. Le Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de faire de leur mieux pour trouver et communiquer les documents se rapportant \u00e0 l'embauche et au maintien en poste des membres autochtones et plus particuli\u00e8rement les documents qui se rapportent au point qu'elles ont soulev\u00e9 au paragraphe 1(n) de leur Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nB. La requ\u00eate de la plaignante [29] Mme Gaucher a demand\u00e9 la communication des dossiers du personnel complets des cinq individus nomm\u00e9s qui, selon ce qu'elle all\u00e8gue, ont obtenu une promotion en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas plus qualifi\u00e9s qu'elle l'\u00e9tait. Les Forces canadiennes ont communiqu\u00e9 les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite de quatre des cinq individus nomm\u00e9s dans l'Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Gaucher.\n[30] Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent que les Conseils de promotion au m\u00e9rite, lorsqu'ils prennent des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des promotions, n'examinent pas le dossier du personnel complet, mais seulement les documents contenus dans le dossier du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles pr\u00e9tendent que seulement les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la question des promotions.\n[31] Cependant, le contre-interrogatoire du t\u00e9moin des Forces canadiennes a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que les rapports d'\u00e9valuation du rendement, qui sont inclus dans le dossier du personnel, mais non dans le dossier du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite, sont remplis par le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du candidat et sont ensuite not\u00e9s. La note est envoy\u00e9e au Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, on peut soutenir que ce document est pertinent et qu'il doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 pour chacun des individus nomm\u00e9s. Il y a \u00e9galement une certaine indication que d'autres portions des dossiers du personnel des membres sont prises en compte lors de la pr\u00e9paration des documents pour les dossiers du Conseil de promotion au m\u00e9rite. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, j'ordonne que tout le dossier du personnel des individus nomm\u00e9s soit communiqu\u00e9.\n[32] Bien qu'elles aient fait de leur mieux, les Forces canadiennes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de trouver le dossier du cinqui\u00e8me individu. L'avocat de Mme Gaucher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tudierait \u00e0 fond avec Mme Gaucher d'autres fa\u00e7ons d'\u00e9crire le nom et d'autres noms. C'est ce qui semble \u00eatre le mieux pouvant \u00eatre fait dans ce cas. Les Forces canadiennes doivent continuer \u00e0 aider l'avocat de Mme Gaucher \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le dossier du personnel de cet individu peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9.\n[33] Mme Gaucher a en outre demand\u00e9 les noms et les coordonn\u00e9es des t\u00e9moins qu'elle a l'intention de citer. L'avocate des Forces canadiennes s'est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 indiquer \u00e0 l'avocat de Mme Gaucher lesquels des individus apparaissant sur la liste de t\u00e9moins de Mme Gaucher ne sont plus membres des Forces canadiennes. Ces renseignements permettront \u00e0 l'avocat de Mme Gaucher d'\u00eatre plus en mesure de chercher les renseignements dont il a besoin pour prendre contact avec ces t\u00e9moins qui ne sont plus membres des Forces canadiennes.\n[34] Dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l'avocat de Mme Gaucher ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 obtenir les renseignements dont il a besoin, il peut fournir aux t\u00e9moins \u00e9ventuels des lettres dans des enveloppes affranchies et scell\u00e9es en les remettant aux Forces canadiennes qui posteront alors les enveloppes aux derni\u00e8res adresses connues de ces individus qui ne sont plus membres des Forces canadiennes. \u00c9videmment, les individus sont tout \u00e0 fait libres de r\u00e9pondre ou non \u00e0 la lettre.\nC. Ordonnance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate de la plaignante\nLe Tribunal ordonne aux Forces canadiennes de communiquer les dossiers du personnel des membres nomm\u00e9s qui, selon ce qu'all\u00e8gue Mme Gaucher, ont obtenu une promotion m\u00eame s'ils n'\u00e9taient pas plus qualifi\u00e9s qu'elle l'\u00e9tait.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] J'ai examin\u00e9 les observations du plaignant ainsi que celles de la Commission. Naturellement, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'affirmation que ma demande d'observations additionnelles \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la demande d'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) est d\u00e9plac\u00e9e.\n[2] La d\u00e9claration de la Commission que les questions constitutionnelles relatives au paragraphe n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience ne tient pas compte du fait assez \u00e9vident que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'instance. Si la logique du plaignant et de la Commission \u00e9tait juste, il ne serait pas possible d'examiner quelque d\u00e9fense que ce soit en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour en soulever.\n[3] Je suis oblig\u00e9 de rejeter ce type d'argument qui compromettrait l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus. La poursuite d'une plainte concernant la diffusion de messages haineux est diff\u00e9rente d'une affaire civile ordinaire. Un intim\u00e9 ne renonce pas \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat complet des questions en litige tout simplement parce qu'il ne compara\u00eet pas. S'il existe une d\u00e9fense \u00e9vidente, le Tribunal est tenu de l'examiner.\n[4] Je ne trouve rien \u00e0 redire quant \u00e0 la conclusion de la Commission. Il est toutefois n\u00e9cessaire d'affirmer que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par les parties que les questions constitutionnelles relatives \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Ce n'est tout simplement pas le cas. Les questions soulev\u00e9es en vertu de la disposition sont urgentes et elles exigent notre attention.\n[5] Il y a \u00e9galement l'id\u00e9e qu'un intim\u00e9 qui refuse de participer au processus doit, d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre, aviser les autres parties quant aux questions constitutionnelles en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cela semble plut\u00f4t oblig\u00e9. Je ne vois rien pour emp\u00eacher la d\u00e9livrance d'un avis constitutionnel apr\u00e8s qu'une question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. C'est le fond de l'exigence qui est important et non pas la forme.\n[6] Je conviens n\u00e9anmoins qu'il est mieux de traiter les questions constitutionnelles dans une audience o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat. Cela n'emp\u00eache pas un Tribunal de traiter de l'affaire dans une cause o\u00f9 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus l'exige. Il s'agit d'une question de conscience au m\u00eame titre que toute autre chose.\n[7] Il est inutile de poursuivre la discussion. Le plaignant et la Commission m'ont avis\u00e9 qu'ils d\u00e9siraient se d\u00e9sister de leur demande d'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire en vertu de l'article. C'est \u00e0 eux de d\u00e9cider. Il n'y a aucune question en suspens et l'affaire est close.\nM.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir des d\u00e9pens. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e tr\u00e8s tard dans le processus d'instruction, peu de temps apr\u00e8s que j'eus rejet\u00e9 la plainte pour non-lieu. On peut probablement pr\u00e9tendre que la requ\u00eate aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au cours de l'audience. Je consens n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 mettre cela de c\u00f4t\u00e9 afin de trancher la demande.\n[2] La demande est \u00e9galement compliqu\u00e9e par le fait que l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9clame des d\u00e9pens contre la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne plut\u00f4t que contre le plaignant, et cela en d\u00e9pit du fait que la Commission n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Je crois que l'intim\u00e9 estime qu'il suffit que la Commission soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme partie dans l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause. La Commission a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de ma d\u00e9cision de rejet de la plainte. Cela donne \u00e0 penser qu'elle demeure partie \u00e0 l'instance.\n[3] Je ne sais pas quel est exactement le statut de la Commission dans l'instruction. Il existe toutefois un probl\u00e8me plus fondamental. L'intim\u00e9 invoque le fait que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. C'est la Commission et non pas le plaignant qui d\u00e9cide si la cause sera entendue.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu de fa\u00e7on implicite, \u00e0 tout le moins, que la plainte n'aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e :\n[Traduction]\nL'avocat de Garfield a consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer pour ladite audience devant le Tribunal. Si la Commission avait demand\u00e9 et (ou) avait examin\u00e9 la preuve de Ronaldo avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, elle aurait constat\u00e9 que Ronaldo \u00e9tait incapable de prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'un ou l'autre aspect de ladite plainte.\nL'intim\u00e9 a par la suite envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la Commission d\u00e9clarant qu'il demanderait l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens si l'affaire \u00e9tait entendue.\n[5] Ce n'est pas la bonne fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. D\u00e8s qu'une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, la Commission ne peut pas arr\u00eater le processus. L'instruction doit aller de l'avant. Si l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait m\u00e9content du renvoi, il aurait d\u00fb demander une r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[6] Je ne connais pas la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Commission. Je crois que je suis toutefois oblig\u00e9 d'aller de l'avant au motif que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit. La situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente s'il y avait quelque chose qui laissait entrevoir un motif ill\u00e9gitime ou un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il est clair que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour g\u00e9rer et prot\u00e9ger sa propre proc\u00e9dure.\n[7] Cela n'entre pas en jeu en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je crois que l'affaire devrait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, laquelle exerce un pouvoir de contr\u00f4le sur la Commission. L'intim\u00e9 peut toujours soulever la question lors du contr\u00f4le.\n[8] La requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nM.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Les Forces canadiennes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obliger la communication de certains dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant \u00e0 la plaignante, Mme Micheline Montreuil.\n[2] Mme Montreuil a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre les Forces canadiennes le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2002, all\u00e9guant que celles-ci avaient fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en raison de son sexe et d'une perception de d\u00e9ficience lorsqu'elles ont refus\u00e9 de lui permettre de s'enr\u00f4ler \u00e0 nouveau dans les Forces canadiennes. Les Forces ont invoqu\u00e9, comme motif de leur refus, que Mme Montreuil n'avait pas satisfait aux exigences m\u00e9dicales.\n[3] Mme Montreuil estime qu'elle est une transgend\u00e9riste. Elle \u00e9tait de sexe masculin lorsqu'elle est n\u00e9e. Toutefois, \u00e0 un certain moment, elle a entam\u00e9 le processus m\u00e9dical visant \u00e0 la transformer en femme. Elle n'a pas termin\u00e9 ce processus.\n[4] Mme Montreuil a consult\u00e9 trois m\u00e9decins dans le but de changer son identit\u00e9 sexuelle. Ces m\u00e9decins sont : le Dr Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, psychiatre, le Dr Roland Tremblay, endocrinologue, et le Dr Martine Lehoux, dermatologue. Les Forces canadiennes veulent maintenant que Mme Montreuil communique les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux mont\u00e9s par ces trois m\u00e9decins ainsi que les noms et les dossiers des autres m\u00e9decins qui auraient pu avoir particip\u00e9 au processus de changement de sexe.\n[5] Mme Montreuil refuse de communiquer les dossiers des trois m\u00e9decins parce que, selon elle, ils ne sont pas pertinents. Elle pr\u00e9tend que les Forces canadiennes tentent de faire une question d'ordre m\u00e9dical d'une question essentiellement sociologique de fait et d'attitude concernant les personnes transgend\u00e9ristes. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le processus m\u00e9dical suivi pour changer son identit\u00e9 sexuelle n'est pas en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] Toutefois, il convient de souligner que l'alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal exigent le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l'ensemble des documents qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d'autres parties.\n[7] Les Forces canadiennes pr\u00e9tendent que Mme Montreuil souffrent de troubles m\u00e9dicaux li\u00e9s au processus de changement de sexe ainsi qu'\u00e0 son identit\u00e9 sexuelle et que ces troubles l'emp\u00eachent de satisfaire aux normes m\u00e9dicales applicables \u00e0 l'enr\u00f4lement. Bien que Mme Montreuil ne croie peut-\u00eatre pas qu'il existe, en l'esp\u00e8ce, des questions m\u00e9dicales li\u00e9es \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 sexuelle et au processus de changement de sexe, les Forces canadiennes croient qu'il en existe.\n[8] Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Beaudry c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada [2002] D.C.D.P. no 32, paragraphe 7 (Q.L.), l'intim\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de son droit d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous les renseignements pertinents dont il a besoin pour pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 l'encontre de la plainte. Les Forces canadiennes ont fait part de leur intention de faire t\u00e9moigner un expert quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Montreuil. Les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant au processus de changement de sexe aideront l'expert de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Mme Montreuil.\n[9] Mme Montreuil a \u00e9galement contest\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de la demande de communication, pr\u00e9tendant qu'elle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache. Toutefois, selon moi, la port\u00e9e de la demande de communication a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e comme il se devait; seuls les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qui ont trait au processus de changement de sexe et \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle de Mme Montreuil doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s. Selon les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les consultations que Mme Montreuil a eues avec les Drs C\u00f4t\u00e9, Tremblay et Lehoux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9es au processus de changement de sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, la communication des dossiers de ces m\u00e9decins quant au cas de Mme Montreuil n'occasionnera vraisemblablement pas la communication de renseignements qui ne sont pas pertinents aux questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[10] On doit apporter une certaine pr\u00e9cision ici. Les Forces canadiennes ont demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9livrance d'un subpoena duces tecum quant aux dossiers m\u00e9dicaux des m\u00e9decins. Un subpoena duces tecum est une ordonnance sommant une personne de compara\u00eetre pour \u00eatre interrog\u00e9e sous serment et la sommant d'apporter avec elle certains documents. \u00c0 l'\u00e9tape de la communication du processus du Tribunal, cela n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Tout ce dont on a besoin \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, c'est tout simplement d'une ordonnance de la part du Tribunal indiquant que les documents doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant \u00e0 Micheline Montreuil (ou Pierre Montreuil, comme elle s'appelait autrefois), dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, y compris les notes d'\u00e9tudes cliniques, les rapports de consultation, les r\u00e9sultats de test sanguin et tout autre r\u00e9sultat de laboratoire ou r\u00e9sultat de test, soient communiqu\u00e9s par les m\u00e9decins suivants :\nLe Dr Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9, M.D., psychiatre, CSPQ, FRCP (C), H\u00f4tel-Dieu du Sacr\u00e9-Cur de J\u00e9sus de Qu\u00e9bec, avenue du Sacr\u00e9-Cur, Qu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec) G1N 2W1; Le Dr Roland R. Tremblay, D.Sc., M.D., Ph.D., endocrinologue, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec, 2705, boulevard Laurier, Sainte-Foy (Qu\u00e9bec) G1V 4G2; Le Dr Martine Lehoux, M.D., Centre Dermatologique du Qu\u00e9bec M\u00e9tropolitain, 2880, chemin des Quatre-Bourgeois, suite 101, Sainte-Foy (Qu\u00e9bec) G1V 4X7.\n[12] Afin de prot\u00e9ger le droit de Mme Montreuil \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, les documents devraient \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 l'avocat des Forces canadiennes et ne devraient \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 aucune autre personne sans que le Tribunal n'y ait d'abord consenti et sans que Mme Montreuil n'en soit avis\u00e9e. Les documents peuvent \u00eatre consult\u00e9s par des experts m\u00e9dicaux dont les services sont retenus par les Forces canadiennes, et ce, uniquement aux fins du pr\u00e9sent litige et ne doivent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins qui ne concernent pas le pr\u00e9sent litige. Les documents doivent \u00eatre retourn\u00e9s lorsque le dossier de l'affaire sera clos.\n[13] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, Mme Montreuil a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait consult\u00e9 aucun autre sp\u00e9cialiste, avant 1997, concernant sa transition du sexe masculin au sexe f\u00e9minin. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne semble pas qu'une communication de documents m\u00e9dicaux concernant le processus de changement de sexe, autre que la communication des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux des m\u00e9decins susmentionn\u00e9s, ne soit exig\u00e9e. Toutefois, on rappelle \u00e0 Mme Montreuil qu'elle demeure tenue de communiquer tous les documents existants concernant le processus de changement de sexe, que ceux-ci soient ant\u00e9rieurs ou post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 1997.\n[14] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de communication, Mme Montreuil a mentionn\u00e9 que, entre l'\u00e2ge de 13 et 43 ans, elle a v\u00e9cu de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons comme travesti. Les Forces canadiennes, en r\u00e9ponse, ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le travestisme de Mme Montreuil est pertinent \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle \u00e9prouvait et \u00e9prouve toujours un probl\u00e8me d'identit\u00e9 sexuelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, les Forces ont demand\u00e9 la communication de tous les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant au travestisme de Mme Montreuil.\n[15] On pourrait discuter plus longuement de la pr\u00e9sente question. Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais donner aux parties l'occasion, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de discuter de la communication de ces documents ainsi que des autres questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique portant sur la gestion de l'instance. Je rendrai, au besoin, une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0. On communiquera avec les parties dans la semaine qui suivra la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision afin de fixer la date de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[TRADUCTION]\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien\ndes droits de la personne\n[1] Le Syndicat des travailleurs unis des transports (le Syndicat) a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'on lui accorde le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une plainte faisant intervenir Catherine Hoyt et la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le CN). La plaignante, Mme Catherine Hoyt, a consenti \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et l'intim\u00e9e, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'opposait, ni ne consentait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[2] L'article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne accorde au Tribunal un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 l'attribution du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e (Eyerley c. Seaspan International Ltd. [2000] D.C.D.P. no 16, paragraphe 3 (Q.L.)). Pour d\u00e9cider s'il y a lieu d'accorder ou non le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans un cas particulier, il incombe aux demandeurs de d\u00e9montrer en quoi leur expertise aiderait le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher les questions dont il est saisi (Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel) [2000] D.C.D.P. no 15, paragraphe 23 (Q.L.); Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (Division du transport) c. Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien International lt\u00e9e, [2000] A.C.F. 220 (C.A.F.), paragraphe 12).\n[3] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le CN a soulev\u00e9 la question de la participation du Syndicat aux efforts visant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Hoyt. Le CN pr\u00e9tend notamment que le Syndicat n'a pas agi d'une mani\u00e8re obligeante ou raisonnable en ce qui concerne les efforts visant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Hoyt.\n[4] Le Syndicat pr\u00e9tend qu'il est mieux plac\u00e9 que Mme Hoyt pour r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9sentes all\u00e9gations \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Hoyt n'occupait pas de poste au Syndicat et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle n'a pas eu directement connaissance de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 entre le Syndicat et le CN. Le Syndicat fait valoir que, sans sa participation, le Tribunal aura une image incompl\u00e8te de l'affaire. J'accepte que la participation du Syndicat est n\u00e9cessaire si on veut avoir une compr\u00e9hension compl\u00e8te des efforts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits afin d'accommoder Mme Hoyt.\n[5] Suffirait-il que les repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat participent comme t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l'audience? Je ne crois pas. On a fait certaines all\u00e9gations dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, qui, si elles sont fond\u00e9es, peuvent avoir une incidence sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Syndicat. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, le Syndicat devrait avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de traiter de la question de sa participation aux efforts d'accommodement ainsi que de toute autre question pouvant toucher \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[6] Pour cette raison, le Syndicat se verra accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et pourra notamment produire une preuve, interroger et contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins et pr\u00e9senter des arguments quant \u00e0 des questions pouvant toucher \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats et quant \u00e0 sa participation aux efforts d'accommodement. J'encourage le Syndicat \u00e0 consulter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l'avocat de Mme Hoyt afin de voir \u00e0 ce que le travail ne soit pas fait en double.\n[7] Le Syndicat fournira un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ainsi qu'une divulgation compl\u00e8te de la preuve qu'il d\u00e9sire pr\u00e9senter, et ce, en conformit\u00e9 avec l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. La divulgation doit comprendre les noms des t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s ainsi qu'un court r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chaque t\u00e9moin. L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sera d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et la divulgation sera termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 27 janvier 2006. L'intim\u00e9e aura jusqu'au 27 f\u00e9vrier 2006 pour d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et pour divulguer tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en r\u00e9ponse.\n[8] Le Tribunal se r\u00e9serve le droit de traiter toute question relative \u00e0 la gestion de l'instance d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

LA PLAINTE [1] En 2001, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vue de devenir membre de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC), mais selon sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e pour des motifs discriminatoires, \u00e0 savoir son orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue et sa situation de famille (ses liens avec son fr\u00e8re). Il a pr\u00e9tendu que ce refus contrevenait \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu de plus que la GRC a men\u00e9 au sujet de son emploi \u00e9ventuel une enqu\u00eate qui sugg\u00e9rait l'existence d'une restriction, d'une condition ou d'une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence fond\u00e9e sur son orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue, en contravention de l'article 8 de la Loi. De plus, le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que la GRC a appliqu\u00e9, afin de d\u00e9terminer son orientation sexuelle, des lignes de conduite susceptibles d'annihiler ses chances d'emploi, en contravention de l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[2] Des avocats repr\u00e9sentaient le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9e lors de l'audience. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a choisi de ne pas compara\u00eetre lors de l'audience.\nII. QUE DOIT \u00c9TABLIR LE PLAIGNANT POUR PROUVER LE BIEN-FOND\u00c9 DE SA PLAINTE? [3] Un plaignant a le fardeau initial d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. L'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley), fournit les r\u00e8gles de base concernant l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie. La Cour d\u00e9clare qu'une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict favorable au plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Une fois que la preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable d\u00e9montrant que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ne s'est pas produite comme cela \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que la conduite \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire. Si une explication raisonnable est fournie, il appartient au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que l'explication constitue un simple pr\u00e9texte pour exercer de la discrimination (Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38474 (TCDP)).\n[5] Il suffit, pour prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, que la discrimination soit seulement l'un des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur (Holden c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.)). La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s utilis\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re civile.\n[6] La discrimination n'est pas une pratique qu'on devrait s'attendre \u00e0 voir ouvertement. Un tribunal devrait par cons\u00e9quent examiner toutes les circonstances lorsqu'il \u00e9tablit l'existence de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme une subtile odeur de discrimination. Dans des affaires comportant de la preuve circonstancielle, une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e lorsque la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au soutien de l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination rend une telle inf\u00e9rence plus probable que le font les autres inf\u00e9rences ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles (Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 38486-7; voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Chopra c. Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (TCDP)).\n[7] Conform\u00e9ment aux principes pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment expos\u00e9s, et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail toute la preuve et toutes les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, j'ai conclu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des portions de sa plainte se rapportant aux articles 7 et 10. Toutefois, la GRC a fourni des explications qui sont raisonnables et qui ne sont pas un pr\u00e9texte. Je rejette par cons\u00e9quent ces portions de la plainte.\n[8] Le plaignant n'a avanc\u00e9 aucun argument \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 8 au cours de l'expos\u00e9 initial ou au cours des observations finales. Le plaignant n'a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve appuyant son all\u00e9gation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'article 8 ou s'y rapportant. Je ne peux que tenir pour acquis que le plaignant a choisi de ne pas donner suite \u00e0 cet aspect de la plainte. De toute fa\u00e7on, le Tribunal commettrait lui-m\u00eame un manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la justice naturelle s'il essayait de formuler des arguments au soutien de cet aspect de la plainte et s'il tentait ensuite d'en tirer des conclusions. La portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 8 doit par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. LE PLAIGNANT A \u00c9TABLI UNE PREUVE PRIMA FACIE \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DES PORTIONS DE SA PLAINTE SE RAPPORTANT AUX ARTICLES 7 ET 10 [9] Le plaignant est natif du Nouveau-Brunswick. En novembre 1989, il a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en techniques polici\u00e8res de l'Atlantic Police Academy au Holland College \u00e0 Charlottetown, \u00e0 l'\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard. En 1990, il a amorc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re en travaillant \u00e0 temps partiel en tant que policier pour le service de police municipale de Shediac et Tracadie-Sheila, au Nouveau-Brunswick. En juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par le service de police de la ville de Dieppe, au Nouveau-Brunswick, o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'en 1993. Il s'est par la suite joint de nouveau au service de police municipale de Tracadie-Sheila et, en 1997, il s'est joint au service de police de la ville avoisinante de Caraquet, dans la p\u00e9ninsule acadienne.\n[10] Dans les ann\u00e9es 1990, en application de la politique du gouvernement provincial visant l'\u00e9tablissement et la mise en uvre de normes de police uniformes dans tout le Nouveau-Brunswick, de nombreux services de police municipale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 la GRC suivant une entente sp\u00e9ciale. En d\u00e9cembre 2000, la municipalit\u00e9 de Caraquet a approuv\u00e9 l'int\u00e9gration de son service de police \u00e0 la GRC, l'int\u00e9gration devant prendre effet le 1er novembre 2001.\n[11] Selon le plan d'int\u00e9gration, la GRC a contract\u00e9 l'obligation d'engager dans la mesure du possible les policiers \u00e0 temps plein qui travaillaient pour le service de police de Caraquet et qui poss\u00e9daient les comp\u00e9tences professionnelles n\u00e9cessaires. Pour pouvoir \u00eatre engag\u00e9s par la GRC, les policiers de Caraquet devaient subir une entrevue et des examens m\u00e9dicaux et psychom\u00e9triques. De plus, ils devaient r\u00e9ussir une v\u00e9rification de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 qui serait faite \u00e0 leur endroit. Contrairement aux nouvelles recrues, ils ne devaient pas suivre une formation au centre de formation de la GRC \u00e0 Regina et ils n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de r\u00e9ussir des tests d'\u00e9valuation de la condition physique ou de faire des examens \u00e9crits.\n[12] Le plaignant \u00e9tait s\u00fbr que la GRC l'engagerait. On s'attendait depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es \u00e0 l'int\u00e9gration; le plaignant et la plupart de ses coll\u00e8gues policiers de Caraquet avaient donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 subi et r\u00e9ussi leurs examens m\u00e9dicaux avant l'an 2000. Bien qu'on lui ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain moment de refaire son examen psychom\u00e9trique, on ne l'a pas inform\u00e9 qu'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes quant aux r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9finitifs. Tout se passait comme pr\u00e9vu lorsque le 2 mars 2001 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande officielle en vue de devenir membre de la GRC.\n[13] De nombreux coll\u00e8gues et superviseurs des services de police de Caraquet et d'autres municipalit\u00e9s o\u00f9 il avait travaill\u00e9 ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait un policier tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tent. Il \u00e9tait honn\u00eate, fiable, poli, jovial et tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9. Encore aujourd'hui, ils le recommanderaient sans r\u00e9serve pour un emploi dans toute organisation de police, y compris dans la GRC. En fait, un bon nombre de ces t\u00e9moins s'\u00e9taient joints \u00e0 la GRC apr\u00e8s l'int\u00e9gration de leur service de police municipale respectif et ils ont affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant pouvait exercer sans probl\u00e8mes les fonctions qu'exerce un membre de la GRC. La d\u00e9cision de la GRC de finalement refuser d'engager le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 une surprise autant pour eux que pour le plaignant.\n[14] Le 14 mars 2001, le plaignant a eu une entrevue avec un membre de la GRC, le gend. Jean-Paul St-Laurent. \u00c0 ce moment, le gend. St-Laurent travaillait au service des ressources humaines de la GRC \u00e0 Fredericton, en tant que coordonnateur du recrutement et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de coordonner l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 pour tous les postulants \u00e0 un emploi dans la GRC, qu'ils soient de nouvelles recrues ou des policiers travaillant d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour les services de police qui \u00e9taient int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 la GRC.\n[15] Les questions du gend. St-Laurent au cours de l'entrevue \u00e9taient vari\u00e9es, allant de la situation financi\u00e8re et des passe-temps du plaignant \u00e0 ses amis et sa famille, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue de sa consommation d'alcool le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. La rencontre s'est termin\u00e9e sans que le plaignant ait eu l'impression qu'il y avait quelque pr\u00e9occupation que ce soit quant \u00e0 sa demande. Le gend. St-Laurent lui a dit que dans la prochaine \u00e9tape du processus, ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions pos\u00e9es lors de l'entrevue seraient v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es dans le contexte de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9.\n[16] Plusieurs semaines plus tard, la GRC a nomm\u00e9 Joseph Yves Desaulniers pour mener certaines des enqu\u00eates sur le terrain quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 des policiers de Caraquet qui avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vue de devenir membre de la GRC. M. Desaulniers \u00e9tait un membre retrait\u00e9 de la GRC dont les services \u00e9taient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement retenus \u00e0 forfait pour mener ces types d'enqu\u00eates. \u00c0 la demande de la GRC, le plaignant avait fourni les noms de plusieurs connaissances et coll\u00e8gues comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. M. Desaulniers a rencontr\u00e9 nombre de ces individus, y compris Rodrigue McGraw.\n[17] M. McGraw \u00e9tait un policier exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 du service de police de Caraquet et il avait travaill\u00e9 avec le plaignant pendant environ trois ans. M. McGraw n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi l'examen m\u00e9dical que lui et les autres policiers de Caraquet avaient subi avant l'int\u00e9gration. Sachant que par cons\u00e9quent la GRC ne l'engagerait pas, il avait sollicit\u00e9 et obtenu un emploi aupr\u00e8s de la fonction publique provinciale avant l'int\u00e9gration. Lorsque M. Desaulniers a pris contact avec lui, il occupait d\u00e9j\u00e0 son nouvel emploi et il ne travaillait plus avec le plaignant.\n[18] M. Desaulniers a eu une entrevue avec M. McGraw au bureau de ce dernier \u00e0 Bathurst. Ils ont eu une courte conversation d'au plus vingt minutes. M. McGraw a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'interrogation initiale \u00e9tait une interrogation ouverte et se rapportait au type de personne que le plaignant \u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. M. Desaulniers a alors demand\u00e9 si le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel. M. McGraw \u00e9tait d\u00e9contenanc\u00e9 et visiblement troubl\u00e9 par cette question. M. Desaulniers a expliqu\u00e9 que la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t dans son enqu\u00eate. Il ne disait pas n\u00e9cessairement que le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel, il ne faisait que poser la question. M. McGraw a dit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur qu'il serait surpris si le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel.\n[19] M. McGraw pr\u00e9tend qu'il \u00e9tait si troubl\u00e9 par l'interrogation, qu'il en a discut\u00e9 avec un coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 son nouveau lieu de travail imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la rencontre. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a de plus soulev\u00e9 l'incident \u00e0 Aubin Albert, qui \u00e9tait le chef du service de police de Caraquet \u00e0 ce moment. M. Albert n'a toutefois pas mentionn\u00e9 une telle conversation dans son t\u00e9moignage. M. McGraw n'a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 parler de l'interrogation au plaignant que vers le 17 avril 2001.\n[20] M. Desaulniers a \u00e9galement eu une entrevue avec Denis McLaughlin, qui \u00e9tait l'une des autres personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es par le plaignant comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales. Le plaignant et lui avaient travaill\u00e9 ensemble au service de police de Tracadie-Sheila. M. McLauglin avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC apr\u00e8s l'int\u00e9gration du service de police de Tracadie-Sheila en 1997.\n[21] M. McLaughlin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait eu une entrevue avec M. Desaulniers relativement au plaignant. Il a dit \u00e0 M. Desaulniers que, \u00e0 son avis, le plaignant pouvait exercer les fonctions de policier de la GRC aussi bien que tout autre membre. Cependant, il a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours de l'entrevue M. Desaulniers lui a pos\u00e9 une question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant m\u00eame s'il ne pouvait pas se rappeler exactement la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle la question \u00e9tait formul\u00e9e. M. McLaughlin \u00e9tait surpris d'entendre la question et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa seule r\u00e9ponse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas si le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel et que cela ne l'int\u00e9ressait pas.\n[22] Le 8 mai 2001, le gend. St-Laurent a convoqu\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 une rencontre au bureau de la GRC \u00e0 Caraquet. Le gend. St-Laurent a dit sur-le-champ au plaignant qu'il avait une mauvaise nouvelle, \u00e0 savoir que sa demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la GRC \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 la raison du rejet. Le gend. St-Laurent a expliqu\u00e9 que son dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par des officiers de haut rang au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 Fredericton et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que, en raison de plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments mineurs, il ne [traduction] correspondait pas \u00e0 l'image d'un policier de la GRC. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 des raisons pr\u00e9cises. On lui a dit que son fr\u00e8re, qui vivait en Colombie-Britannique, avait un dossier criminel pour agression sexuelle, et que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur de la d\u00e9cision. Le fait que le plaignant ait auparavant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1980, une demande en vue de devenir membre de la GRC et que cette demande ait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un facteur de la d\u00e9cision. Sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 consomm\u00e9 de la marijuana et du haschisch avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur.\n[23] Au cours de la rencontre, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait entendu dire que la GRC avait pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait homosexuel. Selon le plaignant, le gend. St-Laurent a r\u00e9pondu que ce sujet n'est jamais venu sur la table.\n[24] Malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation du gend. St-Laurent, et compte tenu des renseignements fournis par M. McGraw \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions que lui avait pos\u00e9es M. Desaulniers, le plaignant soup\u00e7onnait que son orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue avait pu \u00eatre un facteur de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l'engager. Il a par cons\u00e9quent demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McGraw de signer une d\u00e9claration exposant ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 au cours de la rencontre de ce dernier avec M. Desaulniers. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un questionnaire sous une forme typique de questions et r\u00e9ponses, avec des blancs pour que M. McGraw y inscrive ses r\u00e9ponses. M. McGraw a rempli et sign\u00e9 le document le 19 mai 2001.\n[25] M. McGraw a joint au questionnaire une feuille sur laquelle il avait inscrit sous forme de r\u00e9cit ce dont il se souvenait de la conversation. J'ai inclus les extraits suivants du r\u00e9cit, comme ils \u00e9taient \u00e9crits. M. McGraw y mentionne Denis Albert et Serge Losier, qui sont tous deux des personnes que le plaignant avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales dans sa demande \u00e0 la GRC. M. Desaulniers les avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tous deux rencontr\u00e9s avant sa rencontre avec M. McGraw :\nLe ou vers le 28 mars 2001, j'ai re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Jean Yves Desaulniers me demandant si il \u00e9tait possible de me rencontrer personnellement. [...] La rencontre a eu lieu entre onze heures et midi \u00e0 mon bureau. Il m'a dit : connais-tu bien personnellement Daniel Maillet de la Police de Ville de Caraquet. J'ai r\u00e9pondu : je crois, oui.\nQ [M. Desaulniers] : Quelle sorte de gars qu'il [le plaignant] est?\nR [M. McGraw] : Un gars solitaire. Il vit dans une maison construit dans le bois \u00e0 Caraquet. C'est un gars qui se m\u00eale de ses affaires, travaillant et poli.\nQ : \u00c0 l'ouvrage, comment \u00e9tait-il?\nR : Il est aim\u00e9 de tout le monde. Nous aimons beaucoup le taquiner. On dirait que si on le taquine pas, il se sent pas aim\u00e9.\nQ : Est-ce vrai qu'il est homosexuel?\nR : Quoi... Quoi-c\u00e9 que tu dis l\u00e0? Mais o\u00f9 que \u00e7a sort cette histoire l\u00e0?\nQ : Denis Albert, qu'est-ce qu'il a affaire avec Daniel?\nR : C'est un ami.\nQ : Pourquoi on les appellent Daniel et Denise?\nR : C'est un joke \u00e7a. Denis est bien trop macho pour \u00eatre un fif.\nQ : Il a une boucle d'oreille ou un pin dans l'oreille, quelque chose de m\u00eame?\nR : J'ai pas fait attention. Aie, mais c'est fort une accusation de m\u00eame.\nQ : Je ne dit pas qu'il en est un. C'est \u00e7a que j'ai su sur mon enqu\u00eate. Ils sont souvent ensemble. Ils ont presque un pareil Jeep. Il y a aussi un autre gars de Tracadie, par l\u00e0, qui est assez souvent avec. \u00c7a serait t'y ben un homo, celui l\u00e0?\nR : Je ne le connais pas. Je ne jurerais pas que Daniel Maillet n'est pas un homo mais je serais le plus surpris du monde.\nQ : Pourquoi presque tous ses sorties sont par Tracadie et non en ville et qu'il est soit avec Denis Albert ou le Losier de Tracadie?\nR : Daniel Maillet quelques ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es est tomb\u00e9 follement amoureux de la fille [...] de Tracadie. Je ne me rappelle pas son nom. Il a sorti plus de deux ans avec. Il l'aime toujours m\u00eame si il essaye de le cacher et \u00e7a se voit. C'est pour \u00e7a qu'il est par l\u00e0. Peut-\u00eatre dans l'espoir de recommencer avec.\nQ : Qu'il soit homosexuel ou non, \u00e7a change rien. Il n'aura qu'\u00e0 l'admettre pis c'est correct.\n[...]\n[26] Le plaignant s'attendait \u00e0 recevoir une lettre de refus de la GRC apr\u00e8s sa deuxi\u00e8me rencontre avec le gend. St-Laurent, mais les semaines ont pass\u00e9 et il n'a re\u00e7u aucune lettre. \u00c0 part M. McGraw, qui selon ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, tous les coll\u00e8gues policiers du plaignant \u00e0 Caraquet qui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vue de devenir membre de la GRC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis dans la GRC. Alors que la date du transfert \u00e0 la GRC du service de police de Caraquet approchait (le 1er novembre 2001), le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'informer les m\u00e9dias de ce qu'il percevait comme un refus discriminatoire de la GRC de l'employer. Son affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et \u00e0 la radio de m\u00eame que dans la presse \u00e9crite.\n[27] Le 31 octobre 2001, le journal local, l'Acadie Nouvelle, a publi\u00e9 un article. La journaliste Sylvie Paulin-Grondin, aux fins de son article, a fait une entrevue avec le plaignant et plusieurs autres personnes, y compris avec le sous-officier charg\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations du d\u00e9tachement de la GRC \u00e0 Caraquet, le sergent Michel Pag\u00e9. Avant l'int\u00e9gration du service de police municipale, la GRC avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement \u00e0 Caraquet qui desservait la r\u00e9gion avoisinante. Le sergent Pag\u00e9 connaissait par cons\u00e9quent les membres du service de police de Caraquet, y compris le plaignant, et avait particip\u00e9 au processus d'int\u00e9gration.\n[28] Mme Paulin-Grondin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pour obtenir une entrevue avec le sergent Pag\u00e9, elle lui avait laiss\u00e9 un message \u00e0 son bureau. Il l'a rappel\u00e9e et elle a men\u00e9 l'entrevue au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle a cit\u00e9 textuellement le sergent Pag\u00e9 dans son article. Le sergent Pag\u00e9 n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience. Le sergent Pag\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 comme ayant initialement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas faire de commentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affaire du plaignant ou de celle de tout autre individu. Il a n\u00e9anmoins ensuite affirm\u00e9 que la candidature du plaignant ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de la GRC. Il a ajout\u00e9 que tous les candidats \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, \u00e0 savoir que leur \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, leur r\u00e9putation, leur moralit\u00e9 et leur situation financi\u00e8re \u00e9taient examin\u00e9s. Toutefois, il a de plus fait la d\u00e9claration suivante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle des candidats :\nMais je peux vous dire que l'orientation sexuelle n'est pas un crit\u00e8re. La GRC ne discrimine pas quelqu'un qui est gai, absolument pas! Ca pourrait cependant cr\u00e9er des probl\u00e8mes si l'employeur n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de \u00e7a.\nAdmettons qu'une personne est gaie et que l'employeur ne le sait pas. Cela peut constituer un risque au niveau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Si un membre de la GRC a une orientation quelconque et ne veut pas que son employeur le sache, il peut faire l'objet de chantage, se faire extorquer, se faire soutirer des renseignements. On parle ici en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et non d'un cas particulier. Mais on doit respecter la Charte des droits. C'est tr\u00e8s important.\n[29] Apr\u00e8s la publication de ces commentaires, ni le sergent Pag\u00e9 ni la GRC n'ont pris contact avec Mme Paulin-Grondin pour avancer l'id\u00e9e qu'elle avait mal compris ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations du sergent Pag\u00e9.\n[30] Le jour m\u00eame de la publication de l'article, la GRC a envoy\u00e9 au plaignant une lettre l'informant officiellement que sa demande \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e. La lettre \u00e9tait sign\u00e9e par le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers, le sous-officier charg\u00e9 du recrutement (gestionnaire sup\u00e9rieur de carri\u00e8res) de la division J (Nouveau-Brunswick). Il mentionnait que dans le cas du plaignant, la GRC avait jug\u00e9 que son [traduction] comportement \u00e9vasif au cours de l'entrevue et le fait qu'il ait fourni des renseignements qui avaient par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s incoh\u00e9rents soulevaient des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et de son honn\u00eatet\u00e9.\n[31] Le lendemain, le 1er novembre 2001, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit au sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers en se plaignant du fait qu'on ne lui avait jamais dit avant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vasif au cours de l'entrevue ni qu'il avait fourni des renseignements erron\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9 par ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations et il demandait qu'on lui fournisse plus de d\u00e9tails. Le 22 novembre 2001, le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit au plaignant pour l'informer que la d\u00e9cision de la GRC n'avait pas chang\u00e9 et qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitive. Son dossier avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet d'une r\u00e9vision et une \u00e9valuation compl\u00e8te avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\n[32] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2001, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[33] En somme, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de la preuve selon laquelle la GRC, avant de refuser de l'employer, a men\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son orientation sexuelle. Les commentaires du sergent Pag\u00e9 selon lesquels l'orientation sexuelle cach\u00e9e d'un candidat est un fait qui int\u00e9resse la GRC corroborent la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant selon laquelle son orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue \u00e9tait un facteur de la d\u00e9cision de la GRC. De plus, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de la preuve selon laquelle on lui a dit cat\u00e9goriquement que le dossier criminel de son fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un facteur de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l'engager. Je suis convaincu, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, que cette preuve, si on lui ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une conclusion selon laquelle il y a eu, suivant l'article 7 de la Loi, de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue du plaignant et sur sa situation de famille. Une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[34] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, si l'on ajoute foi \u00e0 la preuve, une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 10. Les questions de M. Desaulniers se rapportant \u00e0 l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant, ajout\u00e9es aux commentaires du sergent Pag\u00e9, et le rejet d\u00e9finitif de la candidature du plaignant donnent \u00e0 penser, en l'absence d'une explication qui est raisonnable et qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte, qu'il existait une ligne de conduite visant une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi du plaignant.\nIV. LA R\u00c9PONSE DE LA GRC \u00c0 LA PLAINTE SUIVANT L'ARTICLE 7 - POURQUOI LE PLAIGNANT N'A-T-IL PAS \u00c9T\u00c9 ENGAG\u00c9? [35] La GRC pr\u00e9tend que l'orientation sexuelle per\u00e7ue du plaignant et ses liens avec son fr\u00e8re n'\u00e9taient d'aucune fa\u00e7on des facteurs de sa d\u00e9cision de rejeter sa demande d'emploi. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour de nombreux autres motifs, principalement li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait per\u00e7u comme un manque de franchise et d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 au cours de son entrevue avec le gend. St-Laurent. J'ai conclu que cette explication \u00e9tait raisonnable. En outre, le plaignant n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'explication \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une conduite par ailleurs discriminatoire.\n[36] L'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 est d'une grande importance pour la GRC qui doit s'assurer que l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 d'un membre est indiscutable. La personne qui m\u00e8ne l'entrevue a un formulaire sur lequel les questions \u00e0 poser aux candidats sont expos\u00e9es et les r\u00e9ponses sont consign\u00e9es. Le formulaire est utilis\u00e9 seulement par la personne qui m\u00e8ne l'entrevue; les candidats n'en prennent pas connaissance. Le formulaire utilis\u00e9 par le gend. St-Laurent au cours de l'entrevue du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve comme pi\u00e8ce lors de l'audience.\n[37] Conform\u00e9ment aux instructions contenues sur le formulaire, le gend. St-Laurent a d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but dit au plaignant que la GRC m\u00e8nerait par la suite une enqu\u00eate sur le terrain pour v\u00e9rifier tout ce qu'il affirmait au cours de l'entrevue. Il a par cons\u00e9quent conseill\u00e9 au plaignant d'\u00eatre honn\u00eate, direct et complet dans ses r\u00e9ponses. Toute tentative d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de mentir ou d'omettre des renseignements priverait le candidat de la possibilit\u00e9 que sa candidature continue \u00e0 \u00eatre examin\u00e9e aux fins d'un emploi.\n[38] La GRC pr\u00e9tend qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9, apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification, que de nombreuses r\u00e9ponses du plaignant \u00e9taient fausses ou incompl\u00e8tes, ce qui avait mis en doute son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et ses comp\u00e9tences en tant que policier.\n[39] Le gend. St-Laurent n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le rendement et le comportement d'ensemble du plaignant au cours de l'entrevue. Il a d\u00e9crit le plaignant comme un individu tr\u00e8s silencieux et r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 fournir les renseignements demand\u00e9s. La plupart des candidats sont au d\u00e9part nerveux, mais ils finissent par s'ouvrir et ils s'engagent librement dans une discussion avec la personne qui m\u00e8ne l'entrevue. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas avec le plaignant. Il n'\u00e9tait pas bavard et il fallait souvent que le gend. St-Laurent le pousse \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre et le questionne. Il fallait que les questions soient fr\u00e9quemment r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es afin de lui soutirer une r\u00e9ponse.\n[40] Il y a \u00e0 la fin du formulaire d'entrevue une section dans laquelle la personne qui m\u00e8ne l'entrevue \u00e9crit son impression g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la personne re\u00e7ue en entrevue. Le gend. St-Laurent a \u00e9crit que le plaignant semblait tr\u00e8s nerveux et qu'il \u00e9tait difficile d'obtenir des [traduction] r\u00e9ponses directes \u00e0 de nombreuses questions; le plaignant ne pouvait pas se souvenir ou n'\u00e9tait pas certain.\n[41] Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des r\u00e9ponses du plaignant, associ\u00e9es \u00e0 plusieurs contradictions qui sont ressorties au cours des v\u00e9rifications subs\u00e9quentes (ci-apr\u00e8s expos\u00e9es), l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'il ne pouvait pas recommander la candidature du plaignant. Le gend. St-Laurent a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par \u00e9crit ces conclusions dans une note de service dat\u00e9e du 25 avril 2001 qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers, le gestionnaire sup\u00e9rieur de carri\u00e8res.\nA. Incoh\u00e9rences et divergences \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la consommation de drogues par le plaignant [42] Le formulaire utilis\u00e9 pour l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 contient une s\u00e9rie de questions se rapportant \u00e0 la consommation de drogues. On demande aux candidats s'ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s \u00e0 des drogues et s'ils ont consomm\u00e9 des drogues. Dans l'affirmative, ils doivent expliquer le type de drogue consomm\u00e9e, la fr\u00e9quence de consommation, les dates de la premi\u00e8re et de la derni\u00e8re consommations, et les circonstances ou les raisons qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la consommation.\n[43] Le plaignant a dit au gend. St-Laurent qu'il avait consomm\u00e9 du cannabis et du haschisch. Le gend. St-Laurent a consign\u00e9 sur le formulaire que chaque drogue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consomm\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises, les circonstances \u00e9tant [traduction] l'exp\u00e9rience et dans un contexte social. Quant aux dates de consommation, la r\u00e9ponse inscrite \u00e9tait [traduction] ne sais pas, c'\u00e9tait il y a longtemps. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le gend. St-Laurent a insist\u00e9 pour qu'il soit plus pr\u00e9cis, mais le stress de cette s\u00e9rie de questions lui a caus\u00e9 un trouble de m\u00e9moire et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de donner des d\u00e9tails.\n[44] Le gend. St-Laurent a en outre demand\u00e9 au plaignant de lui fournir les noms et les adresses des membres de sa famille, comme le formulaire d'entrevue l'exige. Un grand nombre des membres de sa famille vivent aux \u00c9tats-Unis et il n'a par cons\u00e9quent pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de donner au cours de l'entrevue les d\u00e9tails demand\u00e9s. Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il pourrait obtenir ces renseignements apr\u00e8s l'entrevue. Le gend. St-Laurent a consenti \u00e0 ce que le plaignant lui envoie ces d\u00e9tails par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur apr\u00e8s la rencontre.\n[45] \u00c0 son retour \u00e0 son bureau au poste de police municipale de Caraquet plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re et il a obtenu les coordonn\u00e9es des membres de sa famille. Il a ensuite \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main une lettre de deux pages qu'il a envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur au gend. St-Laurent. Dans cette lettre, il a expos\u00e9 ces d\u00e9tails, mais il a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9, sous le titre Section sur les drogues, deux paragraphes pr\u00e9cisant les deux occasions au cours desquelles il avait consomm\u00e9 des drogues. La premi\u00e8re occasion mentionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait l'hiver 1994, \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'entr\u00e9e d'une \u00e9cole secondaire, avant d'entrer pour assister \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e dansante qui avait lieu \u00e0 cet endroit. La deuxi\u00e8me occasion mentionn\u00e9e est le printemps ou l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1995, \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'une bo\u00eete de nuit nomm\u00e9e Cosmo, \u00e0 Moncton. Il d\u00e9clare qu'\u00e0 chaque occasion il a consomm\u00e9 de la marijuana et du haschisch.\n[46] Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 lors de l'audience qu'il avait en fait consomm\u00e9 des drogues en 1984 et 1985, et non en 1994 et 1995. Il n'a constat\u00e9 l'erreur dans sa lettre envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur que quelques jours avant sa deuxi\u00e8me rencontre avec le gend. St-Laurent le 8 mai 2001. Le plaignant n'a pas tent\u00e9 avant cette rencontre d'informer le gend. St-Laurent de son erreur. Il a signal\u00e9 l'erreur au gend. St-Laurent au cours de la rencontre, mais le gend. St-Laurent a dit qu'il \u00e9tait trop tard; la d\u00e9cision de ne pas recommander sa candidature avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\n[47] Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait effectivement dit au plaignant de lui envoyer par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur les adresses de ses parents am\u00e9ricains. Il \u00e9tait concevable que le plaignant ne se rappelle pas facilement ces d\u00e9tails au cours de l'entrevue. Toutefois, le gend. St-Laurent n'\u00e9tait pas impressionn\u00e9 par le fait que le plaignant en ait profit\u00e9 pour compl\u00e9ter certaines de ses autres r\u00e9ponses d'entrevue ou pour ajouter des renseignements. Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le but de l'entrevue est de tester la fiabilit\u00e9 et l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 des candidats, en v\u00e9rifiant l'exactitude de leurs r\u00e9ponses. On s'attend donc \u00e0 ce que les candidats r\u00e9pondent de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te \u00e0 toutes les questions qui sont pos\u00e9es au cours de l'entrevue, sauf peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 des questions exigeant des r\u00e9ponses d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, comme l'adresse et le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone d'un parent.\n[48] En outre, le gend. St-Laurent \u00e9tait \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de voir le plaignant d\u00e9clarer avoir consomm\u00e9 des drogues si r\u00e9cemment, alors qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 amorc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re de policier. Il \u00e9tait de plus d\u00e9contenanc\u00e9 par l'\u00e2ge que le plaignant aurait eu au moment de la consommation de drogues d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, au point o\u00f9 il a inscrit sur son exemplaire du document t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9 le commentaire suivant : [traduction] 30 ans. Le gend. St-Laurent n'a pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette consommation ill\u00e9gale de drogues comme une simple exp\u00e9rience de jeunesse. Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la GRC n'\u00e9cartera g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas des candidats simplement parce qu'ils ont pu essayer certaines drogues moins dures alors qu'ils \u00e9taient \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole secondaire. Cependant, une consommation plus r\u00e9cente, m\u00eame \u00e0 titre d'exp\u00e9rience, notamment alors que la personne exerce d\u00e9j\u00e0 la profession de policier, est beaucoup plus pr\u00e9occupante. Le gend. St-Laurent se demandait \u00e9galement pourquoi le plaignant \u00e9tait soudainement capable de se rappeler les ann\u00e9es exactes de sa consommation de drogues, apr\u00e8s avoir eu tant de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s'en souvenir au cours de l'entrevue.\n[49] Une autre question pos\u00e9e au plaignant au cours de l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait celle de savoir si un service de police, y compris la GRC, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 refus\u00e9 de l'employer. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vue de devenir membre de la GRC au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1980, mais que sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'entrevue parce qu'il avait admis avoir essay\u00e9 des drogues quelques ann\u00e9es auparavant.\n[50] Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a tenu compte de tous les renseignements fournis par le plaignant, comme ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis. Le refus fond\u00e9 sur la consommation de drogues au cours des ann\u00e9es 1980, associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration transmise par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur selon laquelle il avait consomm\u00e9 des drogues en 1994 et 1995, supposait qu'il s'agissait de plus qu'une simple exp\u00e9rience.\n[51] Dans le contexte du processus de v\u00e9rification, le gend. St-Laurent a pris contact avec le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Jacques Ouellette, l'agent de dotation de la GRC qui avait eu une entrevue avec le plaignant au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1980. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Ouellette ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment du plaignant. Cependant, il a ajout\u00e9 que s'il avait rejet\u00e9 une demande en raison d'une consommation de drogues d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, cette consommation avait d\u00fb avoir lieu \u00e0 au moins trois ou quatre reprises.\n[52] Le gend. St-Laurent a par cons\u00e9quent commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement inquiet quant au nombre des divergences qui ressortaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la consommation de drogues du plaignant. Ce qui au d\u00e9part \u00e9tait une admission de consommation de drogues \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises \u00e0 titre d'exp\u00e9rience, qui avait eu lieu il y a si longtemps que le plaignant \u00e9tait incapable de se rappeler les circonstances r\u00e9elles, s'\u00e9tait maintenant transform\u00e9 en au moins sept ou huit occasions de consommation qui avaient eu lieu aussi r\u00e9cemment qu'en 1995, alors que le plaignant exer\u00e7ait la profession de policier.\nB. Incoh\u00e9rences et divergences \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du d\u00e9part du plaignant du service de police de Dieppe [53] Les r\u00e9ponses du plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son emploi aupr\u00e8s du service de police de Dieppe pr\u00e9occupaient \u00e9galement le gend. St-Laurent. L'enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la GRC afin de v\u00e9rifier les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le plaignant lors de l'entrevue a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 de nombreuses divergences.\n[54] Les candidats doivent, avant l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9, remplir un questionnaire pour l'obtention de l'autorisation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui comporte une s\u00e9rie de questions se rapportant aux emplois ant\u00e9rieurs. Les candidats doivent donner, dans le cas o\u00f9 ils auraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s, le nom de leur superviseur et une br\u00e8ve explication quant aux motifs de cong\u00e9diement. Le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 dans son questionnaire qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 du service de police de Dieppe en 1993, apr\u00e8s trois ans de service. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu et cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour de suppos\u00e9s erreurs dans mon travail, qu'il a par la suite soumis son cas \u00e0 l'arbitrage et qu'il a r\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour de l'argent.\n[55] Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails quant \u00e0 cet incident au cours de son entrevue avec le gend. St-Laurent. La suspension se rapportait \u00e0 une affaire de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies dans laquelle il devait t\u00e9moigner. Malheureusement, il \u00e9tait gripp\u00e9 le jour du proc\u00e8s et, alors qu'il attendait pour t\u00e9moigner, il a d\u00fb sortir de la salle d'audience et se rendre aux toilettes publiques. Il semble que le procureur n'a pas pu trouver le plaignant lorsque le temps est venu pour lui de t\u00e9moigner. Pour une raison ou pour une autre, la Couronne a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retirer les accusations plut\u00f4t que de demander un ajournement.\n[56] Le chef de police de Dieppe, Terry Rouse, a par la suite inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu'il serait suspendu pendant sept jours. Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief, mais peu de temps apr\u00e8s il a carr\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 du service de police. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du cong\u00e9diement. Le jour de l'audition de l'arbitrage, l'employeur \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 proc\u00e9der. Il a donc offert au plaignant, \u00e0 titre de r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif pour les deux griefs, la somme de 40 000 $ pour qu'il quitte le service de police. Le plaignant a accept\u00e9 l'offre. Il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 cette solution \u00e0 celle qui consistait \u00e0 retourner sur un lieu de travail o\u00f9 ses activit\u00e9s seraient constamment examin\u00e9es minutieusement.\n[57] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait bien connu, au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 de maintien de l'ordre du Nouveau-Brunswick, que Rouse \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s strict dans ses relations avec les policiers. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a discut\u00e9 de ce fait avec le gend. St-Laurent, qui connaissait la r\u00e9putation du chef et qui a reconnu que cela expliquerait probablement les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont conduit au cong\u00e9diement du plaignant.\n[58] Le plaignant avait apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue des documents se rapportant au cong\u00e9diement et a offert de les montrer au gend. St-Laurent. L'offre a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a m\u00eame offert, si on le lui demandait, de se soumettre au d\u00e9tecteur de mensonges \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son explication quant au cong\u00e9diement de Dieppe. Le gend. St-Laurent ne se souvient pas de cette offre.\n[59] Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le gend. St-Laurent a \u00e9crit certains commentaires personnels sur le formulaire d'entrevue. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant du service de police de Dieppe et que ses autres dossiers d'emploi devraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il y avait peut-\u00eatre [traduction] une question de rendement qui devait \u00eatre clarifi\u00e9e et examin\u00e9e.\n[60] Le gend. St-Laurent a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Dale Mitton, un sergent d'\u00e9tat-major retrait\u00e9 de la GRC, d'examiner les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d'emploi du plaignant au service de police de Dieppe. Le service de police de cette ville avait \u00e0 ce moment \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC, dans le contexte du processus de fusion provinciale. Puisque le chef Rouse, qui avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant, \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t, M. Mitton a rencontr\u00e9 l'ancien chef de police adjoint, Alan Parker, qui \u00e9tait maintenant un membre de la GRC en poste \u00e0 Moncton. Dans son questionnaire, le plaignant avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 M. Parker comme un de ses superviseurs \u00e0 Dieppe avec lequel on pouvait prendre contact pour des renseignements additionnels.\n[61] M. Parker a dit \u00e0 M. Mitton que le plaignant, alors qu'il travaillait pour le service de police de Dieppe, avait eu un [traduction] mauvais rendement et qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9 aux normes minimales auxquelles devait se conformer un policier d\u00e9butant. Il n'achevait pas son travail \u00e0 temps et il ne respectait jamais les dates d'agenda. Il \u00e9tait [traduction] peu s\u00e9rieux dans son travail. M. Parker a \u00e9galement dit \u00e0 M. Mitton que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu et par la suite cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son mauvais rendement et en raison du fait qu'il ne respectait pas les exigences minimales. M. Parker a confirm\u00e9 que le plaignant avait accept\u00e9 un [traduction] d\u00e9dommagement et qu'il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 du service de police. M. Parker a en outre mentionn\u00e9 qu'un ancien policier municipal de Moncton, Paul Desroches, lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vu dans la bo\u00eete de nuit Cosmo \u00e0 Moncton, buvant \u00e0 l'exc\u00e8s et fr\u00e9quentant des [traduction] gens de r\u00e9putation douteuse. Il avait m\u00eame pu \u00eatre [traduction] sous l'effet de drogues.\n[62] M. Mitton a rencontr\u00e9 M. Desroches pour faire un suivi \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces renseignements. M. Desroches se rappelait avoir re\u00e7u un appel d'un [traduction] citoyen pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 qui all\u00e9guait que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vu dans une bo\u00eete de nuit du centre-ville en compagnie de [traduction] femmes de mauvaise r\u00e9putation, s'adonnant \u00e0 la conduite en \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 et consommant des drogues. M. Desroches a signal\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas pu confirmer l'exactitude des renseignements, le citoyen n'ayant pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son nom. M. Desroches a simplement transmis les renseignements \u00e0 M. Parker.\n[63] Ni M. Desroches ni M. Parker n'ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience devant le Tribunal. M. Mitton a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve un rapport d'enqu\u00eate qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et remis au gend. St-Laurent \u00e0 la fin de mars 2001, dans lequel ces d\u00e9tails \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des conversations qu'il avait eues avec M. Desroches et M. Parker \u00e9taient expos\u00e9s.\n[64] Dans le contexte de son enqu\u00eate, M. Mitton s'est en outre rendu \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel de ville de Dieppe. Il a obtenu des photocopies des proc\u00e8s-verbaux des r\u00e9unions du conseil municipal se rapportant \u00e0 la suspension, au cong\u00e9diement et aux griefs du plaignant, photocopies qu'il a \u00e9galement transmises au gend. St-Laurent.\n[65] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal du 25 mai 1993 traitait longuement de la suspension du plaignant. Le chef Rouse a inform\u00e9 le conseil que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu avec salaire [traduction] en raison de difficult\u00e9s de rendement dans son travail depuis la fin de sa p\u00e9riode d'essai de six mois. Le chef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant ne respectait pas ses [traduction] exigences de travail, en renvoyant \u00e0 trois ou quatre incidents, un desquels se rapportait au proc\u00e8s de conduite en \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9, au cours duquel, selon ce que le chef a pr\u00e9tendu, le plaignant [traduction] s'\u00e9tait effondr\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre apr\u00e8s l'interrogatoire principal. Le chef a ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant avait des [traduction] probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux appels graves comportant des contacts physiques. Apr\u00e8s une certaine interrogation de suivi, le conseil a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de soutenir la d\u00e9cision du chef Rouse de suspendre le plaignant.\n[66] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union du conseil dat\u00e9 du 25 avril 1994 se rapporte \u00e0 l'entente qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9e avec le plaignant, en r\u00e8glement de ses griefs en mati\u00e8re de travail. Certaines des conditions de l'entente sont expos\u00e9es, notamment l'engagement du plaignant \u00e0 retirer ses griefs et \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner du service de police, en \u00e9change d'une somme d'argent. On y mentionne que le chef Rouse a assur\u00e9 le conseil que la ville avait un [traduction] cas solide, mais que les frais juridiques pour poursuivre l'affaire seraient plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que s'il y avait un r\u00e8glement suivant une entente n\u00e9goci\u00e9e.\n[67] M. Mitton a en outre obtenu de l'h\u00f4tel de ville de Dieppe des photocopies des relev\u00e9s d'emploi et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du plaignant. La ville avait fourni au plaignant deux relev\u00e9s d'emploi afin de lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter des demandes de prestations d'assurance-emploi. Le premier relev\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli apr\u00e8s sa suspension et son cong\u00e9diement et le deuxi\u00e8me apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement des griefs. Les deux formulaires contiennent un commentaire selon lequel on ne s'attendait pas \u00e0 ce que l'employ\u00e9 reprenne son travail parce qu'il [traduction] n'avait pas respect\u00e9 [les] exigences minimales du service de police.\n[68] Un des superviseurs du plaignant au service de police de Dieppe \u00e9tait Robert Bastarache, qui s'est par la suite joint \u00e0 la GRC dans le contexte de l'int\u00e9gration. Au moment de l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain, M. Bastarache \u00e9tait en poste au d\u00e9tachement de la GRC de Bouctouche. Le gend. St-Laurent a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Pierre Quinn, un enqu\u00eateur retrait\u00e9 de la GRC, de rencontrer M. Bastarache pour une entrevue. Selon M. Quinn, M. Bastarache a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait eu vent [traduction] de nombreuses rumeurs se rapportant au plaignant, mais qu'il s'agissait [traduction] simplement de rumeurs. M. Bastarache ne voulait pas donner de d\u00e9tails. Cependant, il a signal\u00e9 que lorsqu'il avait agi en tant que superviseur du plaignant, il avait estim\u00e9 qu'il manquait d'exp\u00e9rience et de maturit\u00e9.\n[69] M. Bastarache a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Quinn qu'il n'avait jamais vu le plaignant prendre des drogues, se pr\u00e9senter au travail avec la gueule de bois ou afficher tout autre signe d'abus de drogues ou d'alcool. Il a termin\u00e9 sa conversation avec M. Quinn en d\u00e9clarant que m\u00eame si le plaignant \u00e9tait [traduction] fier de porter l'uniforme, il [traduction] oubliait [la] responsabilit\u00e9 qui s'y rattachait. M. Bastarache estimait que le manque de maturit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e9tait la cause de son manque de responsabilit\u00e9.\n[70] Les r\u00e9sultats des enqu\u00eates sur le terrain men\u00e9es par M. Quinn et M. Mitton causaient des pr\u00e9occupations au gend. St-Laurent. Les renseignements recueillis donnaient \u00e0 penser que le plaignant avait eu un mauvais rendement alors qu'il travaillait pour le service de police de Dieppe et qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9 aux normes minimales auxquelles un policier devait se conformer. Cela constituait en soi une pr\u00e9occupation, mais le gend. St-Laurent \u00e9tait de plus pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 du fait que le plaignant n'avait pas mentionn\u00e9 au cours de son entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 que le mauvais rendement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur de sa suspension. Le gend. St-Laurent a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 percevoir une divergence importante entre la description faite par le plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des incidents qui avaient conduit \u00e0 son d\u00e9part du service de police de Dieppe et le portrait d\u00e9peint par l'enqu\u00eate de la GRC.\n[71] M\u00eame le comportement qu'avait le plaignant en dehors de son travail \u00e9tait mis en doute. Le gend. St-Laurent a reconnu que certains des renseignements \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des ou\u00ef-dire et des rumeurs. La fiabilit\u00e9 des renseignements re\u00e7us du citoyen pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 anonyme n'avait de toute \u00e9vidence pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Cependant, selon lui, le fait que la bo\u00eete de nuit en cause, le Cosmo Club, \u00e9tait l'endroit o\u00f9 le plaignant avait \u00e9galement admis avoir consomm\u00e9 des drogues dans le pass\u00e9 corroborait [traduction] dans une certaine mesure ces renseignements.\nC. L'omission du plaignant d'avoir divulgu\u00e9 le dossier criminel de son fr\u00e8re [72] Dans le contexte de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9, le gend. St-Laurent \u00e9tait tenu de demander au plaignant si un membre de sa famille imm\u00e9diate ou un ami intime avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles. Selon le gend. St-Laurent, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 deux personnes qu'il avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience que ces deux amis avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris en train de p\u00eacher hors-saison, ce qui constitue une infraction en vertu de la loi, et qu'une amende leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En outre, un de ces hommes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 une altercation avec un voisin, ce qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 une accusation de voies de fait. Il a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 totalement acquitt\u00e9 par la cour.\n[73] Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, dans le contexte du processus normal de v\u00e9rification, le gend. St-Laurent a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si quelque activit\u00e9 criminelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'un ou l'autre des amis ou membres de la famille du plaignant ou de quelque individu d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le plaignant comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rence morale. Le gend. St-Laurent a effectu\u00e9 sa recherche dans la banque de donn\u00e9es informatis\u00e9e nationale dont disposent tous les services de police, banque connue sous le nom du CPIC.\n[74] La recherche a donn\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tonnant. Un des fr\u00e8res du plaignant, \u00e2g\u00e9 d'environ un an et demi de moins que le plaignant, apparaissait dans le Fichier judiciaire nominatif (FJN) qui \u00e9num\u00e8re apparemment les noms des individus contre lesquels des accusations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es et dont les empreintes digitales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises dans le pass\u00e9. Le rapport du FJN pour le fr\u00e8re du plaignant \u00e9tablissait que ses dossiers se rapportaient \u00e0 de [traduction] la violence, des vols et du sexe. Le rapport faisait toutefois une mise en garde selon laquelle l'entr\u00e9e au nom du fr\u00e8re du plaignant ne comportait pas de dossier criminel. Le gend. St-Laurent a par cons\u00e9quent cherch\u00e9 plus \u00e0 fond dans la banque de donn\u00e9es et a appris que le fr\u00e8re du plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable en 1986 d'un vol de moins de 1 000 $, aux termes du Code criminel. Il y avait de plus une indication que le fr\u00e8re du plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d'agression sexuelle en 1987, et de voies de fait en 1998. Ces deux accusations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es en Colombie-Britannique, mais avaient par la suite fait l'objet d'un sursis.\n[75] Une fois de plus, le gend. St-Laurent a eu des doutes et des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la franchise et l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 du plaignant. Pourquoi n'avait-il pas mentionn\u00e9 son fr\u00e8re lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer les noms des membres de sa famille imm\u00e9diate ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 criminelle?\n[76] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au moment de l'entrevue, il ne savait absolument rien de ces accusations et de cette d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Il n'avait plus de contact avec son fr\u00e8re depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es et il savait tr\u00e8s peu de choses quant \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait au courant que son fr\u00e8re, alors qu'il \u00e9tait adolescent et qu'il vivait encore \u00e0 la maison au Nouveau-Brunswick, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 par les policiers relativement \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation d'agression sexuelle. Cependant, aucune accusation n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre lui. Le plaignant se rappelle avoir mentionn\u00e9 ce dernier incident au gend. St-Laurent, mais il ne pouvait pas affirmer avec certitude quand il l'avait fait.\n[77] Le gend. St-Laurent, d'autre part, ne se rappelle pas que le plaignant ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni des renseignements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de quelque activit\u00e9 criminelle de son fr\u00e8re, y compris l'interrogatoire de la police \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'agression sexuelle au Nouveau-Brunswick. Aucune mention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'est consign\u00e9e o\u00f9 que ce soit sur le formulaire que le gend. St-Laurent remplissait au cours de l'entrevue. Les noms des deux amis du plaignant qui ont commis des infractions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la p\u00eache sont, cependant, clairement mentionn\u00e9s dans la section du formulaire pr\u00e9vue pour l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des connaissances ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles.\n[78] Le gend. St-Laurent a reconnu avoir fait, lors de la rencontre du 8 mai 2001, un commentaire selon lequel l'omission du plaignant d'avoir mentionn\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s criminelles de son fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait un facteur de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas recommander son admission dans la GRC. Le gend. St-Laurent a rappel\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l'entrevue du 14 mars de l'importance de ne pas cacher des renseignements que l'enqu\u00eateur tentait d'obtenir.\n[79] Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la GRC n'a pas une ligne de conduite visant \u00e0 refuser l'admission de candidats en raison des activit\u00e9s criminelles de leurs amis ou parents. Effectivement, la GRC n'a pas contest\u00e9 l'affirmation du plaignant selon laquelle certains des policiers engag\u00e9s au cours du processus d'int\u00e9gration avaient des parents imm\u00e9diats qui avaient des dossiers criminels beaucoup plus graves que celui du fr\u00e8re du plaignant. Le gend. St-Laurent a expliqu\u00e9 que si un ami ou un parent qui est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s d'un candidat participe \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles, la GRC examine la question plus \u00e9troitement afin d'\u00e9tablir l'\u00e9tendue de toute influence que cette personne peut avoir sur le candidat. Cependant, ce facteur n'est pas un emp\u00eachement automatique \u00e0 l'admission.\n[80] De toute fa\u00e7on, le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'activit\u00e9 criminelle r\u00e9elle du fr\u00e8re du plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas la question en litige relativement au plaignant. La pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait le fait qu'il avait omis ou cach\u00e9 des renseignements importants au cours de l'entrevue, tout comme il l'avait fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son exp\u00e9rience de travail aupr\u00e8s du service de police de Dieppe et, dans une certaine mesure, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa consommation de drogues. Il importe de souligner que dans sa note de service au sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers, le gend. St-Laurent ne met pas beaucoup d'accent sur le fait que le fr\u00e8re du plaignant se livrait \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles, mais plut\u00f4t sur le fait que le plaignant avait [traduction] omis de divulguer que le FJN comportait une inscription au nom du fr\u00e8re du plaignant pour violence, vol et sexe. Selon le gend. St-Laurent, ce fait constituait une autre divergence qui \u00e9tait ressortie au cours du processus de v\u00e9rification.\nV. LES EXPLICATIONS DE LA GRC \u00c0 L'\u00c9GARD DE LA PLAINTE FOND\u00c9E SUR L'ARTICLE 7 SONT-ELLES RAISONNABLES OU SONT-ELLES SIMPLEMENT UN PR\u00c9TEXTE POUR EXERCER DE LA DISCRIMINATION? [81] J'estime que les explications de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la portion de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 sont raisonnables et ne sont pas un pr\u00e9texte.\n[82] Il est regrettable que le plaignant, lorsqu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, n'ait pas eu en sa possession la note de service du gend. St-Laurent dat\u00e9e du 25 avril 2001, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers, qui expliquait les raisons pour lesquelles il ne recommandait pas la candidature du plaignant comme une candidature acceptable pour un emploi dans la GRC. Il ressort de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente de la note de service que la d\u00e9cision du gend. St-Laurent \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par les divergences qui \u00e9taient ressorties de la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le plaignant lors de l'entrevue de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu la note de service, il a rencontr\u00e9 le gend. St-Laurent pour discuter des conclusions. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers \u00e9tait satisfait des conclusions du gend. St-Laurent et il y a souscrit. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage l'importance pour un candidat de faire preuve d'une [traduction] honn\u00eatet\u00e9 brutale au cours de l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9. Tous les candidats re\u00e7oivent des consignes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[83] Selon la GRC, son enqu\u00eate sur le terrain avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le plaignant n'avait pas fait preuve d'une [traduction] honn\u00eatet\u00e9 brutale. Toutefois, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que ses r\u00e9ponses au cours de l'entrevue \u00e9taient conformes \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et il soutient que les renseignements recueillis par la suite par les enqu\u00eateurs \u00e9taient incomplets et trompeurs, voire compl\u00e8tement erron\u00e9s. Par exemple, le plaignant soutient avec insistance que son d\u00e9part du service de police de Dieppe \u00e9tait totalement volontaire et que sa seule intention en quittant son emploi \u00e9tait d'\u00e9viter toute autre interaction avec le chef Rouse, avec lequel lui et un bon nombre de ses coll\u00e8gues policiers ne pouvaient pas s'entendre. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient d'accord avec le plaignant quant \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation du chef et de l'attitude de ce dernier envers son personnel. Le plaignant conteste de plus le fait que certains des renseignements recueillis \u00e0 Dieppe \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des rumeurs et des ou\u00ef-dire. Il nie la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de toutes ces all\u00e9gations.\n[84] Cependant, il demeure que les renseignements et les documents transmis au gend. St-Laurent par les deux enqu\u00eateurs nomm\u00e9s quant \u00e0 cet aspect de l'enqu\u00eate donnaient \u00e0 penser le contraire. Ils indiquaient que le plaignant avait eu un mauvais rendement et que son cong\u00e9diement motiv\u00e9 aurait en fin de compte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 devant un arbitre du travail si la ville n'avait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avance les griefs. Quant aux rumeurs, le gend. St-Laurent a reconnu qu'elles avaient une valeur probante minime, mais il disposait tout de m\u00eame des renseignements.\n[85] Le gend. St-Laurent ne pouvait d'aucune fa\u00e7on savoir que le plaignant \u00e9tait en brouille avec son fr\u00e8re. Toutefois, il demeure que sa recherche dans la banque de donn\u00e9es du CPIC a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des renseignements qu'il se serait attendu \u00e0 voir divulguer par le plaignant. Je suis convaincu que le gend. St-Laurent a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre v\u00e9ritablement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cette explication est raisonnable et il n'y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu'elle \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte pour exercer de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille du plaignant.\n[86] Quant \u00e0 la consommation de drogues, c'est en raison des omissions et erreurs du plaignant lui-m\u00eame que le gend. St-Laurent a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que la consommation s'\u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e jusqu'en 1995 alors que le plaignant exer\u00e7ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 la profession de policier. Ce fait constituait une pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9vidente pour la GRC. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que la GRC aurait d\u00fb approfondir davantage la question. Elle aurait d\u00fb d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre constater que le plaignant avait fourni des dates erron\u00e9es. Il pr\u00e9tend que cela n'avait pas de sens qu'un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 30 ans ait fum\u00e9 du haschisch et du cannabis \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'une \u00e9cole secondaire o\u00f9 avait lieu une soir\u00e9e dansante. Le gend. St-Laurent aurait d\u00fb se rendre compte de cela et rappeler le plaignant pour lui demander la date exacte.\n[87] \u00c0 mon avis, une telle affirmation est contraire \u00e0 la raison. C'\u00e9tait le plaignant qui pr\u00e9sentait une demande en vue de devenir membre de la GRC et il \u00e9tait tenu de s'assurer que les r\u00e9ponses et les renseignements qu'il fournissait au gend. St-Laurent \u00e9taient exacts et complets. Il ne peut pas bl\u00e2mer la GRC pour s'\u00eatre fi\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qu'il d\u00e9clarait quant aux dates de sa consommation de drogues d\u00e9clar\u00e9e. Ce d\u00e9tail n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni de vive voix lors de l'entrevue, alors qu'il \u00e9tait concevable qu'une d\u00e9claration inexacte puisse se produire. Plut\u00f4t, la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait incluse dans un document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le plaignant de sa propre main apr\u00e8s l'entrevue et envoy\u00e9 par lui \u00e0 la GRC au moyen de l'appareil de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie de son bureau du poste de police de Caraquet.\n[88] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu qu'en fait certaines divergences n'existent pas. Il pr\u00e9tend que toutes ses r\u00e9ponses n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es avec exactitude par le gend. St-Laurent au cours de l'entrevue. Par exemple, il nie avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la quantit\u00e9 et la fr\u00e9quence de sa consommation hebdomadaire d'alcool \u00e9taient celles consign\u00e9es par le gend. St-Laurent sur le formulaire. Le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9crit les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es et que de toute fa\u00e7on la quantit\u00e9 d'alcool consomm\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait inscrite \u00e9tait acceptable et ne constituait aucun obstacle \u00e0 la candidature du plaignant.\n[89] Le plaignant a reconnu qu'un bon nombre des autres parties du questionnaire refl\u00e9taient exactement ses r\u00e9ponses. Les notes du gend. St-Laurent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du service de police de Dieppe correspondent aux explications que le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir donn\u00e9es au cours de l'entrevue. Cependant, l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain pr\u00e9sentait un r\u00e9cit diff\u00e9rent de celui rendu par le plaignant. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, quant \u00e0 la consommation de drogues, la divergence ne se trouvait pas tellement entre les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le plaignant lors de l'entrevue et les entr\u00e9es sur le questionnaire, mais plut\u00f4t entre ses r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es lors de l'entrevue et le document contenant des erreurs qui a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur.\n[90] Finalement, cela n'aurait pas eu beaucoup de sens que le gend. St-Laurent omette d'\u00e9crire le nom du fr\u00e8re du plaignant comme une connaissance se livrant \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 criminelle si le plaignant avait effectivement divulgu\u00e9 ce qu'il savait relativement \u00e0 l'interrogatoire qu'avaient tenu les policiers quant \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re alors que ce dernier vivait encore \u00e0 la maison au Nouveau-Brunswick. J'estime qu'il est peu vraisemblable que le gend. St-Laurent ait consign\u00e9 les noms de deux amis qui avaient ill\u00e9galement fait de la p\u00eache et non le nom d'un fr\u00e8re qui avait fait l'objet d'un interrogatoire quant \u00e0 une agression sexuelle. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que cette omission et que les autres pr\u00e9tendues omissions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et qu'elles faisaient partie d'une plus grande machination organis\u00e9e pour l'emp\u00eacher de devenir membre de la GRC. Comme je l'explique par la suite dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la preuve n'appuie pas cette pr\u00e9tention.\n[91] L'avocat du plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu vigoureusement que tout le t\u00e9moignage du gend. St-Laurent n'\u00e9tait pas digne de foi parce qu'il a initialement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lors de la deuxi\u00e8me rencontre avec le plaignant, la d\u00e9cision de refuser sa mutation n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Pourtant, par la suite lors du contre-interrogatoire du gend. St-Laurent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9voil\u00e9 que son rapport au sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 par un comit\u00e9 de la haute direction en date du 27 avril 2001, presque deux semaines avant la deuxi\u00e8me rencontre (8 mai 2001).\n[92] Le gend. St-Laurent a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas de contradictions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La division J de la haute direction de la GRC a tenu une rencontre le 27 avril 2001. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la rencontre \u00e9nonce que les conclusions d'enqu\u00eate du gend. St-Laurent et sa recommandation avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produites et que le commandant divisionnaire [traduction] souscrivait \u00e0 cette recommandation. Le gend. St-Laurent pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision de rejeter la mutation du plaignant n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement prise. M\u00eame si le commandant divisionnaire souscrivait \u00e0 la recommandation, la demande du plaignant pouvait encore en th\u00e9orie \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. Ce sc\u00e9nario semble invraisemblable, mais \u00e0 mon avis la soi-disant contradiction dans le t\u00e9moignage du gend. St-Laurent, comme l'\u00e9nonce le plaignant, n'a pas de cons\u00e9quences sur la fiabilit\u00e9 de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[93] Ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive avait ou non d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prise lorsque le gend. St-Laurent a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant le 8 mai 2001, la preuve documentaire d\u00e9montre que la recommandation de ne pas accepter la candidature du plaignant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les divergences qui \u00e9taient ressorties au cours de sa v\u00e9rification de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9. Ces divergences soulevaient des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9, de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et du rendement du plaignant. La GRC a conclu que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eate lors de son entrevue, comme le d\u00e9montrait son omission d'avoir mentionn\u00e9 quelque activit\u00e9 criminelle de son fr\u00e8re ainsi que sa divulgation seulement partielle de renseignements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents au service de police de Dieppe et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa consommation de drogues. La GRC a en outre commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir certaines pr\u00e9occupations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses comp\u00e9tences en tant que policier en raison des renseignements recueillis qui donnaient \u00e0 penser qu'il avait eu un mauvais rendement au cours de la p\u00e9riode de son emploi \u00e0 Dieppe et de son apparente admission subs\u00e9quente de consommation de drogues \u00e0 un \u00e2ge relativement m\u00fbr, bien apr\u00e8s qu'il eut amorc\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re dans la police.\n[94] Ces explications sont raisonnables.\nA. La GRC a-t-elle fait une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant? [95] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que les explications de la GRC sont simplement un pr\u00e9texte pour exercer de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 de la question se rapportant \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re. J'estime que les explications de la GRC sont raisonnables et ne sont pas un pr\u00e9texte.\n[96] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant quant \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'orientation sexuelle, la conversation qui a eu lieu entre M. Desaulniers et M. McGraw est de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente une conversation essentielle. Il est admis entre les parties que l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e au cours de cette conversation. M. Desaulniers a facilement reconnu que le sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9, mais il nie qu'il ait soulev\u00e9 la question de la mani\u00e8re expos\u00e9e par M. McGraw.\n[97] Le gend. St-Laurent avait pris contact avec M. Desaulniers au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 la fin de mars 2001 pour lui demander de mener des enqu\u00eates sur le terrain \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les policiers de Caraquet qui sollicitaient leur admission dans la GRC, et non \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant seulement. Il a rencontr\u00e9 plus de 100 personnes dans la r\u00e9gion de Caraquet\/Tracadie-Sheila au cours d'une semaine, principalement des personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales des candidats, de m\u00eame que des voisins et des employeurs. Il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 mener des entrevues \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant avant la fin de la journ\u00e9e le mercredi de cette semaine-l\u00e0.\n[98] Au cours de leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique initiale, le gend. St-Laurent a dit \u00e0 M. Desaulniers qu'il avait certaines pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la candidature du plaignant, pr\u00e9occupations qui r\u00e9sultaient des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es au cours de l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9. M. Desaulniers a consign\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9occupations dans son carnet de notes, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve, y compris la consommation de drogues du plaignant, de m\u00eame que son possible cong\u00e9diement motiv\u00e9 du service de police de Dieppe.\n[99] Avant de rencontrer M. McGraw, M. Desaulniers a eu des entrevues avec plusieurs des amis et coll\u00e8gues de travail du plaignant. Chacun d'eux a fait des commentaires positifs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant, d\u00e9clarant qu'il \u00e9tait un policier honn\u00eate et travaillant et une bonne personne dans l'ensemble. Un des amis avec lequel M. Desaulniers a eu une entrevue \u00e9tait Denis Albert, un ambulancier qui avait rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant environ cinq ans plus t\u00f4t, lorsque ce dernier travaillait pour le service de police de Tracadie. Selon les notes de M. Desaulniers, M. Albert a dit qu'il consid\u00e9rait le plaignant comme un fr\u00e8re a\u00een\u00e9. Ils faisaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ensemble de la plong\u00e9e sous-marine, de la chasse au petit gibier et des randonn\u00e9es hors route dans leurs jeeps. M. Albert a dit \u00e0 M. Desaulniers qu'il croyait que le plaignant \u00e9tait un bon policier qui ferait \u00e9galement un bon policier dans la GRC.\n[100] M. Desaulniers a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Albert avait la t\u00eate ras\u00e9e et quil portait un tatouage au bras. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Albert lui avait laiss\u00e9 une impression. Dans les notes qu'il a consign\u00e9es au cours de l'entrevue, M. Desaulniers a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nT\u00eate ras\u00e9e\/tatouage\nMode de vie diff\u00e9rent????\nFranc, mais quelque chose????\n[101] M. Albert a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l'audience qu'il se rasait effectivement la t\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qu'il avait un tatouage au bras qui refl\u00e9tait le niveau qu'il a atteint dans l'art martial jiu-jitsu. Il portait \u00e9galement une \u00e9pingle \u00e0 l'oreille. Il avait eu l'impression au cours de l'entrevue que M. Desaulniers l'examinait visuellement de la t\u00eate aux pieds, mais il a reconnu qu'un bon nombre de gens le regardaient habituellement diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 cause de son apparence, qu'il d\u00e9crivait comme militaire. Les gens \u00e9taient souvent r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 lui parler \u00e0 cause de son apparence.\n[102] M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en utilisant l'expression [traduction] mode de vie diff\u00e9rent, il voulait dire quelqu'un qui est diff\u00e9rent des autres et qui est hors des normes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, quelqu'un comme M. Albert, qui avait la t\u00eate ras\u00e9e et portait des tatouages et une \u00e9pingle \u00e0 l'oreille. M. Desaulniers estimait que M. Albert \u00e9tait un individu [traduction] curieux, mais il a en outre soulign\u00e9 que ses notes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9taient des notes personnelles. Aucun de ces renseignements n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au gend. St-Laurent. Dans le rapport d\u00e9finitif de M. Desaulniers transmis au gend. St-Laurent, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit lors de l'audience, il expose seulement les activit\u00e9s sportives que M. Albert faisait avec le plaignant, de m\u00eame que sa recommandation positive. M. Desaulniers a \u00e9crit que M. Albert [traduction] r\u00e9pondait du plaignant.\n[103] \u00c0 la suite de l'entrevue avec M. Albert, M. Desaulniers a rencontr\u00e9 M. McGraw. Contrairement au questionnaire que M. McGraw avait rempli pour le plaignant, dans lequel il d\u00e9clarait que la rencontre a eu lieu le 28 mars 2001, il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans le carnet de notes de M. Desaulniers que la rencontre a eu lieu le 6 avril 2001. M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a suivi la m\u00eame m\u00e9thodologie qu'il suit pour toutes ses entrevues. Il a simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McGraw ce qu'il pensait du plaignant. M. McGraw a dit qu'il \u00e9tait un individu honn\u00eate et bon. M. Desaulniers a dit \u00e0 M. McGraw qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs autres personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales, y compris \u00e0 l'ami du plaignant, Denis Albert. M. Desaulniers a ajout\u00e9 qu'on ne pouvait pas facilement oublier M. Albert compte tenu de sa t\u00eate ras\u00e9e, de ses tatouages et de son \u00e9pingle \u00e0 l'oreille.\n[104] \u00c0 ce moment, selon M. Desaulniers, M. McGraw a dit : Oh, tu parles de Denise pis Daniel. M. Desaulniers n'a pas compris ce commentaire et a demand\u00e9 ce qu'il signifiait. M. McGraw a expliqu\u00e9 que certaines personnes non identifi\u00e9es, qui selon ce que M. Desaulniers a tenu pour acquis \u00e9taient des coll\u00e8gues policiers de Caraquet, avaient l'habitude de parler du plaignant et de M. Albert en utilisant cette expression. M. Desaulniers a demand\u00e9 pourquoi. Denis Albert \u00e9tait-il le chum du plaignant? M. Desaulniers se rappelle que M. McGraw a dit : Oh non, c'est pas un gars de m\u00eame, et a ensuite continu\u00e9 \u00e0 parler pendant environ une minute de la copine du plaignant. M. Desaulniers a coup\u00e9 la parole \u00e0 M. McGraw et lui a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel.\n[105] Il a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McGraw, en tant qu'ancien superviseur du plaignant, de donner une opinion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rendement du plaignant au sein du service de police de Caraquet. M. McGraw a dit de nouveau que le plaignant travaillait bien et qu'il avait un bon rendement. Ils ont ensuite discut\u00e9 de ce que M. Desaulniers avait per\u00e7u, au cours de la visite qu'il avait lui-m\u00eame effectu\u00e9e, \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence isol\u00e9e du plaignant. M. McGraw a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant vivait une vie assez solitaire. Ce point avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 par le chef Aubin au cours de son entrevue.\n[106] Les questions ont par la suite port\u00e9 sur les circonstances entourant le d\u00e9part du plaignant du service de police de Dieppe. M. McGraw ne savait rien de l'incident et, selon M. Desaulniers, cette question semblait le secouer plus que la discussion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Albert. Sur un autre point, M. McGraw a mentionn\u00e9 au cours de l'entrevue que le plaignant avait eu certaines difficult\u00e9s concevables \u00e0 accepter la mort subite de son p\u00e8re quelques ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t. C'\u00e9tait l'\u00e9tendue de leur conversation qui, selon M. Desaulniers, a dur\u00e9 environ quinze minutes.\n[107] M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, tout comme il l'avait fait apr\u00e8s chacune des entrevues men\u00e9es \u00e0 Caraquet, d\u00e8s qu'il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son v\u00e9hicule, il a consign\u00e9 dans son ordinateur portable un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'entrevue. L'entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. McGraw comportait onze lignes. Il n'y a pas de mention de l'orientation sexuelle. La derni\u00e8re phrase pr\u00e9cise que M. McGraw n'a fait aucune remarque d\u00e9sobligeante \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant et qu'il r\u00e9pondait de lui. Les m\u00eames notes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9es textuellement dans le rapport que M. Desaulniers a envoy\u00e9 par la suite au gend. St-Laurent.\n[108] L'orientation sexuelle du plaignant n'est mentionn\u00e9e nulle part dans le rapport qui r\u00e9sume toutes les entrevues de M. Desaulniers relativement aux enqu\u00eates sur le terrain men\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant. Tous les commentaires not\u00e9s sont positifs et ils d\u00e9clarent de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le plaignant est un bon policier et une bonne personne dans l'ensemble.\n[109] M. Desaulniers a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 lors de l'audience un document additionnel intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Commentaires de l'enqu\u00eateur \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant, commentaires qui avaient \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits dans son ordinateur. M. Desaulniers a soutenu avec insistance dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait jamais envoy\u00e9 cette note au gend. St-Laurent et qu'il ne lui avait pas non plus communiqu\u00e9 le contenu de cette note de quelque fa\u00e7on. Il s'agissait simplement d'une note qu'il avait consign\u00e9e \u00e0 son dossier. La note \u00e9nonce que m\u00eame si aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9gatif n'\u00e9tait ressorti au cours de l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain, aucune des personnes avec lesquelles il avait eu des entrevues n'avait offert ce qu'il d\u00e9crivait comme un [traduction] soutien solide. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la note \u00e9tait son interpr\u00e9tation des commentaires des personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences quant \u00e0 la moralit\u00e9, qui tendaient tous \u00e0 dire que le plaignant \u00e9tait un individu bon et honn\u00eate, de m\u00eame qu'un bon travailleur. Cependant, personne n'a d\u00e9crit le plaignant dans des termes que M. Desaulniers qualifierait d'extraordinaires.\n[110] M. Desaulniers a en outre soulign\u00e9 dans la note que le plaignant \u00e9tait un [traduction] c\u00e9libataire vivant dans une maison de type chalet assez isol\u00e9e dans les bois. Il terminait sa note en d\u00e9clarant que tous ces commentaires \u00e9taient simplement des observations not\u00e9es [traduction] aux fins du dossier. Il a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait initialement pr\u00e9vu inclure ces observations dans son rapport au gend. St-Laurent, mais en pr\u00e9parant la version d\u00e9finitive du rapport, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ces commentaires n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires et il ne les a donc pas joints au rapport. Le fichier \u00e9lectronique contenant le texte est simplement rest\u00e9 dans son ordinateur.\nB. Les preuves de M. Desaulniers et de M. McGraw peuvent-elles \u00eatre concili\u00e9es? [111] \u00c0 mon avis, M. McGraw et M. Desaulniers semblaient tous deux honn\u00eates et francs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de leur preuve. Je suis conscient que M. McGraw est une connaissance du plaignant et que, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, il ne se qualifiait pas pour devenir membre de la GRC avec ses autres coll\u00e8gues du service de police de Caraquet. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e a avanc\u00e9 qu'il pouvait par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre partial envers la GRC. Je suis \u00e9galement conscient que M. Desaulniers est un ancien agent de la GRC. Il a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les lignes de conduite de la GRC lui interdisaient de mener des enqu\u00eates quant \u00e0 l'orientation sexuelle d'un candidat et a reconnu que tout mandat d'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain qu'il pourrait \u00e0 l'avenir obtenir de la GRC peut \u00eatre compromis s'il \u00e9tait \u00e9tabli qu'il avait fait une telle enqu\u00eate dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[112] En gardant cela en t\u00eate, leurs preuves peuvent-elles \u00eatre concili\u00e9es? Je crois que c'est possible. D'une part, ce dont se souvenait M. McGraw \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 en grande partie sur le questionnaire qu'il avait rempli \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, plus d'un mois apr\u00e8s l'entrevue. En raison de l'\u00e9coulement du temps, il peut se produire des erreurs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce dont une personne se souvient quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Ainsi, par exemple, M. McGraw a inscrit sur le questionnaire que la date de sa rencontre \u00e9tait le 28 mars 2001. Toutefois, je suis convaincu, compte tenu de plusieurs documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve, que la rencontre a eu lieu le 6 avril 2001. D'autre part, M. Desaulniers a inscrit dans son ordinateur, quelques minutes seulement apr\u00e8s la fin de l'entrevue, ce dont il se souvenait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la rencontre. Il n'y a dans ces notes aucune mention de questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. \u00c9videmment, on ne s'attendrait normalement pas \u00e0 ce que quelqu'un qui a sciemment pos\u00e9 des questions discriminatoires reconnaisse dans ses notes avoir eu une telle conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible.\n[113] Mais de toute fa\u00e7on, je n'estime pas qu'il y ait une grande disparit\u00e9 entre ce dont se souviennent les deux hommes quant \u00e0 leur conversation. Les deux hommes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'ils avaient discut\u00e9 de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. M. McGraw a \u00e9crit dans son questionnaire que M. Desaulniers avait entam\u00e9 la discussion en demandant si le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel et avait ensuite demand\u00e9 pourquoi les gens appelaient le plaignant et son ami Daniel et Denise. Dans la s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements que M. McGraw pr\u00e9sente, cette question est survenue de fa\u00e7on plut\u00f4t inattendue et semble \u00eatre totalement hors contexte. Bien que ce dont se souvient M. Desaulniers quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McGraw afin qu'il y r\u00e9agisse, il est significatif que lors du contre-interrogatoire, M. McGraw a admis que son questionnaire ne constituait pas une d\u00e9claration textuelle de la conversation. Il a reconnu que les questions et r\u00e9ponses avaient pu \u00eatre dans un ordre diff\u00e9rent. Le questionnaire \u00e9tait un souvenir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de ce qui s'\u00e9tait dit lors de la rencontre.\n[114] \u00c0 mon avis, la version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements faite par M. Desaulniers a beaucoup plus de sens et est compatible avec les circonstances entourant l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain. M. McGraw \u00e9tait le dernier \u00e0 avoir une entrevue avec M. Desaulniers cette semaine-l\u00e0. M. Desaulniers a mentionn\u00e9 le nom de l'une des personnes qu'il venait juste de rencontrer, M. Albert. M. McGraw a alors mentionn\u00e9 le surnom que l'on donnait au plaignant et \u00e0 M. Albert, Daniel et Denise. M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on ne lui avait pas parl\u00e9 de cette expression auparavant. Effectivement, aucune des autres personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences morales avec lesquelles il avait eu des entrevues, et qui ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es comme t\u00e9moins lors de l'audience, n'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir discut\u00e9 de cette expression avec M. Desaulniers.\n[115] M. Desaulniers reconna\u00eet avoir demand\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse si M. Albert \u00e9tait le conjoint ou le petit ami du plaignant. Il s'agit d'une question qui se rapporte de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente \u00e0 l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant, mais je ne crois pas qu'il s'agissait d'une question calcul\u00e9e au sujet de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. Il convient de noter que M. Desaulniers a eu une entrevue avec M. McGraw non seulement relativement au plaignant, mais \u00e9galement relativement \u00e0 un autre candidat du service de police de Caraquet. M. McGraw a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Desaulniers n'a pos\u00e9 aucune question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle de l'autre candidat. Je suis convaincu, dans toutes les circonstances, que le commentaire de M. McGraw \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du surnom Daniel et Denise a incit\u00e9 M. Desaulniers \u00e0 poser sa question d'une mani\u00e8re spontan\u00e9e, peut-\u00eatre plus par curiosit\u00e9 normale qu'en raison de quelque obligation de sa part de poser des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant aux fins de son enqu\u00eate.\n[116] En fin de compte, ind\u00e9pendamment de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle le sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9, les deux t\u00e9moins conviennent que le dernier commentaire de M. Desaulniers a \u00e9t\u00e9 que l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant ne faisait aucune diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de devenir membre de la GRC.\n[117] De fa\u00e7on plus importante, il n'y a aucune preuve que ce soit qui indique ou m\u00eame qui donne \u00e0 penser que M. Desaulniers ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 transmis de quelque fa\u00e7on au gend. St-Laurent des renseignements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e ou r\u00e9elle, du plaignant. Effectivement, M. Desaulniers et le gend. St-Laurent ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 tous deux qu'encore maintenant, ils n'ont aucune id\u00e9e de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. En fait, la r\u00e9ponse de M. McGraw \u00e0 M. Desaulniers, dans un langage assez grossier (il est trop macho pour \u00eatre un fif), aurait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Desaulniers que le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas homosexuel.\n[118] M. McGraw, \u00e9videmment, n'\u00e9tait pas le seul t\u00e9moin \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre qu'on lui avait pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. M. McLaughlin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on lui a \u00e9galement pos\u00e9 une question \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. M. Desaulniers, dans sa preuve, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement qu'il ne se rappelait aucunement avoir pos\u00e9 une telle question \u00e0 M. McLaughlin. Il se rappelait clairement les circonstances de l'entrevue qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue dans le sous-sol de la maison de M. McLaughlin. Le fils de M. McLaughlin \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent au cours de leurs discussions. De plus, M. Desaulniers a pris de nombreuses notes manuscrites au cours de l'entrevue. Les notes refl\u00e8tent les m\u00eames renseignements que M. McLaughlin a dit avoir fournis, \u00e0 savoir que le plaignant \u00e9tait un bon employ\u00e9 qui faisait du bon travail et qu'il n'avait pas de commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants \u00e0 faire. Les notes indiquaient m\u00eame exactement le nombre d'ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles M. McLaughlin avait travaill\u00e9 en tant que policier. Les notes ne comportent aucune mention de quelque discussion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. Comme dans le cas des commentaires de M. McGraw, la recommandation positive de M. McLaughlin \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la candidature du plaignant \u00e9tait report\u00e9e dans le rapport qui a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au gend. St-Laurent.\n[119] Il semblerait par cons\u00e9quent y avoir une contradiction claire entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Desaulniers et celui de M. McLaughlin. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne suis pas d'avis que le r\u00e9cit de la conversation fait par M. McLaughlin est convaincant. Premi\u00e8rement, il a fait son affirmation pour la toute premi\u00e8re fois vers la fin de son t\u00e9moignage lors de l'audience. Les parties \u00e0 des audiences devant le Tribunal sont tenues par les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal de d\u00e9poser avant l'audience un Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9non\u00e7ant, entre autres, les noms des divers t\u00e9moins qu'elles ont l'intention de citer ainsi qu'un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d'eux, commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage.\n[120] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage de M. McLaughlin mentionnait seulement qu'il t\u00e9moignerait qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 avec le plaignant en tant que policier et que le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences et la moralit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre membre de la GRC. En fait, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage de M. McLaughlin n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rent de celui d'au moins dix autres t\u00e9moins, qui ont fondamentalement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le plaignant avait une bonne moralit\u00e9 et qu'il serait un bon agent de la GRC. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage de M. McGraw, par contre, \u00e9tait assez explicite puisqu'il pr\u00e9voyait qu'il t\u00e9moignerait que M. Desaulniers lui avait pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une repr\u00e9sentation exacte de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[121] Lors de l'audience, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission. Bien que le rapport expose de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e les affirmations de M. McGraw, il n'y a aucune mention que ce soit d'affirmations similaires de la part de M. McLaughlin. En fait, l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission a \u00e9crit que des dix individus avec lesquels M. Desaulniers a eu des entrevues, qui ont accept\u00e9 de lui parler \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'affaire, tous sauf M. McGraw ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'on ne leur avait pas pos\u00e9 de questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. L'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les noms de toutes les personnes \u00e0 qui elle avait parl\u00e9, mais le rapport de M. Desaulniers pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au gend. St-Laurent mentionnait qu'il avait eu des entrevues avec huit amis et coll\u00e8gues, de m\u00eame qu'avec trois voisins. Il est par cons\u00e9quent tr\u00e8s probable que M. McLaughlin soit l'une des dix personnes avec lesquelles elle a pris contact.\n[122] Il semble que m\u00eame l'avocat du plaignant ne connaissait pas avant l'audience l'all\u00e9gation que ferait M. McLaughlin. L'avocat du plaignant a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal au cours des observations finales qu'il n'avait eu ce renseignement que lors de l'audience. En outre, bien que la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant consacre un paragraphe de cinq lignes aux all\u00e9gations de M. McGraw, elle ne comporte aucune mention que ce soit quant aux all\u00e9gations de M. McLaughlin.\n[123] J'estime qu'il est frappant que cette affirmation, qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une preuve aussi importante pour la cause du plaignant que celle de M. McGraw, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois lors de l'audience. Ce fait \u00e0 lui seul soul\u00e8ve la question de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de cette preuve, notamment lorsqu'elle est juxtapos\u00e9e \u00e0 une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation digne de foi de M. Desaulniers qui est appuy\u00e9e par des notes d\u00e9taill\u00e9es et contemporaines et par un souvenir clair de l'entrevue.\n[124] De toute fa\u00e7on, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, il n'y a en fin de compte aucune preuve que ce soit d\u00e9montrant que M. Desaulniers ait donn\u00e9 quelque indication ou ait fait quelque commentaire au gend. St-Laurent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle, per\u00e7ue ou r\u00e9elle, du plaignant ou que la question ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e entre eux. Je n'ai trouv\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, m\u00eame circonstanciel, sugg\u00e9rant le contraire. M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa seule discussion verbale avec le gend. St-Laurent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant a eu lieu au cours de leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique initiale. Par la suite, on lui a remis une enveloppe contenant des photocopies des questionnaires de tous les candidats de Caraquet qui d\u00e9taillaient les noms des membres de la famille, des amis et des coll\u00e8gues de travail avec lesquels il devait prendre contact au cours de l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain.\n[125] M. Desaulniers a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a parl\u00e9 au sergent Pag\u00e9 au cours de l'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain men\u00e9e \u00e0 Caraquet, mais seulement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un autre candidat, et non \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant. Apr\u00e8s avoir achev\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate, il a simplement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses rapports au bureau de la GRC \u00e0 Fredericton. Il n'a pas eu d'autres communications avec le gend. St-Laurent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant jusqu'\u00e0 plusieurs mois plus tard, lorsque le gend. St-Laurent a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour lui dire que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. M. Desaulniers \u00e9tait m\u00eame surpris d'apprendre que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par la GRC. Il avait simplement tenu pour acquis que la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e.\nC. Quelle est la th\u00e9orie du plaignant quant aux raisons du rejet de sa demande? [126] Dans ses observations finales, l'avocat du plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une th\u00e9orie sur la question de savoir comment et pourquoi, selon lui, le plaignant a fait l'objet de discrimination dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[127] L'histoire commencerait avec le sergent Pag\u00e9. Ses commentaires lors de l'entrevue pour le journal r\u00e9v\u00e9laient qu'il ne voulait pas avoir dans son d\u00e9tachement de la GRC des membres homosexuels, compte tenu du risque de chantage auquel des malfaiteurs pourraient les soumettre. Le sergent Pag\u00e9 a fait conna\u00eetre son opinion au gend. St-Laurent avant que la v\u00e9rification de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 ait commenc\u00e9. Le gend. St-Laurent, en raison de la demande du sergent Pag\u00e9, a par la suite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment pos\u00e9 des gestes pour s'assurer que le r\u00e9sultat de la v\u00e9rification de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 du plaignant soit si d\u00e9favorable que le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers n'ait d'autre choix que de rejeter sa candidature. Le gend. St-Laurent a par cons\u00e9quent consign\u00e9 inexactement certaines des r\u00e9ponses du questionnaire d'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 du plaignant. Aux m\u00eames fins, le gend. St-Laurent a en outre refus\u00e9 de regarder le dossier du plaignant en provenance de Dieppe qu'il avait apport\u00e9 avec lui \u00e0 la rencontre.\n[128] \u00c0 la suite de la rencontre, en application de la demande du sergent Pag\u00e9, le gend. St-Laurent a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis de rappeler le plaignant pour lui demander si les dates qu'il avait fournies \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa consommation de drogues \u00e9taient incorrectes. De plus, en donnant des instructions aux enqu\u00eateurs sur le terrain nomm\u00e9s pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'examen des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d'emploi du plaignant \u00e0 Dieppe, le gend. St-Laurent leur a dit de chercher seulement les fausses d\u00e9clarations et les renseignements d\u00e9favorables. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que le gend. St-Laurent a en outre dit \u00e0 M. Desaulniers de faire une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant, toujours en vue du m\u00eame objectif, \u00e0 savoir emp\u00eacher que le plaignant devienne membre de la GRC.\n[129] Les d\u00e9clarations et les renseignements soi-disant faux recueillis par les enqu\u00eateurs permettaient au gend. St-Laurent de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande du sergent Pag\u00e9 et emp\u00eachaient que le plaignant devienne membre de la GRC.\n[130] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j'ai conclu que les faits n'appuient pas la th\u00e9orie du plaignant. Il n'existe aucune preuve que ce soit d\u00e9montrant que le sergent Pag\u00e9 ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 au gend. St-Laurent du plaignant. Il ne ressort pas non plus, du reste, de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente de l'article de journal que le sergent Pag\u00e9 s'oppose \u00e0 ce que des homosexuels deviennent membres de la GRC. Aucune des parties n'a appel\u00e9 le sergent Pag\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\n[131] Il y a certaines failles \u00e9videntes de logique dans la th\u00e9orie. Par exemple, si le sergent Pag\u00e9 croyait d\u00e9j\u00e0 que le plaignant \u00e9tait homosexuel et ne voulait pas qu'il devienne membre de la GRC, pourquoi M. Desaulniers aurait-il re\u00e7u des instructions de poser \u00e0 M. McGraw une question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son orientation sexuelle? Et si une telle question \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, pourquoi la question avait-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. McGraw (et soi-disant \u00e0 M. McLaughlin), et non \u00e0 aucune des autres personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rences quant \u00e0 la moralit\u00e9 avec lesquelles il avait eu des entrevues (au moins neuf autres personnes)?\n[132] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9 que l'affirmation du plaignant selon laquelle le gend. St-Laurent a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis de consigner quelque r\u00e9ponse sur le questionnaire n'est pas fond\u00e9e et qu'il n'est pas logique pour le plaignant de bl\u00e2mer qui que ce soit autre que lui pour l'inscription de dates erron\u00e9es quant \u00e0 sa consommation de drogues. Les divergences n'\u00e9taient pas tellement entre les notes du gend. St-Laurent et les r\u00e9ponses all\u00e9gu\u00e9es du plaignant qu'entre les r\u00e9ponses et les enqu\u00eates sur le terrain. Je suis d'avis que tous les enqu\u00eateurs sur le terrain ont agi de bonne foi. Ils ont simplement fait un rapport de ce qu'ils avaient entendu et leurs t\u00e9moignages \u00e9taient tous, du reste, dignes de foi. Ils \u00e9taient \u00e0 certains moments \u00e9tay\u00e9s par de la preuve documentaire ind\u00e9pendante et ils contenaient souvent des r\u00e9cits positifs. En fait, relativement \u00e0 M. Desaulniers, celui qui a soi-disant fait une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant, son rapport fait au gend. St-Laurent \u00e9tait le plus favorable de tous les rapports d'enqu\u00eate sur le terrain.\n[133] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de traiter plus \u00e0 fond de la th\u00e9orie du plaignant. Elle n'est pas appuy\u00e9e par la preuve et elle est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\n[134] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que les explications de l'intim\u00e9e sont raisonnables et ne sont pas un pr\u00e9texte pour exercer de la discrimination. La portion de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nVI. LA R\u00c9PONSE DE LA GRC \u00c0 LA PORTION DE LA PLAINTE FOND\u00c9E SUR L'ARTICLE 10 : LES LIGNES DE CONDUITE ALL\u00c9GU\u00c9ES N'EXISTENT PAS [135] \u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de l'article 10, le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu dans son formulaire de plainte que la GRC appliquait des lignes de conduite fond\u00e9es sur un motif illicite (son orientation sexuelle) qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d'annihiler ses chances d'emploi. La preuve \u00e9tablissant prima facie la discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette portion de la plainte consistait principalement dans les commentaires faits par le sergent Pag\u00e9 \u00e0 la journaliste et dans le r\u00e9cit de M. McGraw \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce que M. Desaulniers a demand\u00e9 au cours de l'entrevue du 6 avril 2001.\n[136] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision que l'\u00e9change qui a eu lieu au cours de l'entrevue n'avait pas suivi exactement la s\u00e9quence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. McGraw dans sa preuve. J'ai conclu que les questions pos\u00e9es par M. Desaulniers \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es plus par hasard que parce qu'il menait une enqu\u00eate planifi\u00e9e et orchestr\u00e9e, et que c'\u00e9tait le fait que M. McGraw avait mentionn\u00e9 le surnom qui avait d\u00e9clench\u00e9 la discussion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle. En outre, selon la preuve, M. Desaulniers n'a jamais transmis au gend. St-Laurent, ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit de la GRC, quelque renseignement se rapportant \u00e0 l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. Je ne suis par cons\u00e9quent pas d'avis que cette preuve appuie la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant selon laquelle il existait des lignes de conduite pr\u00e9voyant une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son orientation sexuelle susceptibles d'annihiler ses chances d'emploi pour un motif illicite.\n[137] Le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Normand Goulet, un inspecteur aupr\u00e8s de la GRC charg\u00e9 des ressources humaines de la GRC au bureau de Fredericton. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la GRC n'est pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l'orientation sexuelle d'un candidat. Les enqu\u00eateurs sur le terrain re\u00e7oivent des instructions expresses, lors de leur formation \u00e0 l'acad\u00e9mie de la GRC \u00e0 Regina, de ne pas poser de questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle des candidats.\n[138] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que s'il n'y a pas de lignes de conduite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, pourquoi le sergent Pag\u00e9, lorsqu'il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la journaliste, a-t-il d\u00e9fendu ces lignes de conduite soient-disantes non-existantes? En traitant de cette pr\u00e9tention, il est important de noter express\u00e9ment ce que le sergent Pag\u00e9 est cens\u00e9 avoir dit. Il a dit que l'orientation sexuelle d'un candidat n'est pas un facteur lorsqu'il s'agit d'\u00e9tablir si une personne peut devenir membre de la GRC. Cependant, si un membre de la GRC voulait garder secr\u00e8te son orientation sexuelle, cela pourrait l'exposer \u00e0 du chantage ou \u00e0 de l'extorsion. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'agent et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de la GRC peuvent en ce cas \u00eatre mis en danger. L'importance que la GRC accorde \u00e0 ce qu'un candidat soit, comme le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Rogers a dit, d'une [traduction] honn\u00eatet\u00e9 brutale au cours de l'entrevue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'enqu\u00eate de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait implicite dans la d\u00e9claration du sergent Pag\u00e9.\n[139] Par cons\u00e9quent, s'il existe effectivement des lignes de conduite, elles consistent \u00e0 demander aux membres \u00e9ventuels de la GRC s'ils se sont livr\u00e9s \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s cach\u00e9es de la connaissance publique qui pourraient les exposer \u00e0 du chantage ou \u00e0 de l'extorsion. En fait, il y a une question \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans le formulaire d'entrevue de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par le gend. St-Laurent lors de l'entrevue initiale du plaignant.\n[140] Le plaignant n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun argument aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de sa cause \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la GRC de v\u00e9rifier de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des renseignements cach\u00e9s peut avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables pour un candidat ou une cat\u00e9gorie de candidats, sur le fondement de leur orientation sexuelle ou d'un autre motif illicite. Le plaignant n'a simplement pas fait de cette question une question en litige de l'affaire.\n[141] Effectivement, le plaignant n'a presque pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'arguments \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 10. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal e\u00fbt pos\u00e9 des questions directes que l'avocat du plaignant a formul\u00e9 dans une certaine mesure l'all\u00e9gation suivant l'article 10. Il a d\u00e9fini l'\u00e9tendue de l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 comme la mise en place par la GRC de lignes de conduite visant \u00e0 poser des questions \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle d'un candidat, en particulier \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant (pages 1841 et 1842 de la transcription officielle). L'avocat du plaignant a express\u00e9ment exclu de la d\u00e9finition tout renvoi \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie de candidats et il n'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune ligne de conduite exigeant que des candidats divulguent de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la GRC des activit\u00e9s qu'ils ont dissimul\u00e9es en public.\n[142] Dans ces circonstances, il serait inappropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal analyse la question de savoir si cette ligne de conduite visant la divulgation plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a eu des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables pour un individu ou une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus sur le fondement d'un motif illicite. Le fait de faire cette analyse m\u00e8nerait le Tribunal \u00e0 traiter d'un sujet non discut\u00e9 qui n'a simplement jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en litige entre les parties dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cela serait injuste pour les parties et cela pourrait donner lieu \u00e0 un manquement \u00e0 la justice naturelle. Le Tribunal ne peut pas traiter de questions qui ne lui ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises et qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat entre les parties (voir les d\u00e9cisions Bergeron c. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e, 2005 CF 879, au paragraphe 63, et Beauregard c. Postes Canada, 2005 CF 1384, aux paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[143] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, je suis convaincu que l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la courte discussion en litige qui a eu lieu entre M. McGraw et M. Desaulniers ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas qu'il y a eu application par M. Desaulniers de lignes de conduite visant \u00e0 mener une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant. La mani\u00e8re selon laquelle cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e n'appuie pas la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e en application de lignes de conduite et il n'y a pas non plus de preuve, du reste, que les questions annihilaient les chances d'emploi du plaignant. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les commentaires du sergent Pag\u00e9 peuvent au plus servir seulement \u00e0 donner \u00e0 entendre qu'il existe une ligne de conduite distincte et tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente, dont la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 ne m'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, il n'y a dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour appuyer la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant.\n[144] La portion de la plainte se rapportant \u00e0 l'article 10 est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nVII. CONCLUSION - LA PLAINTE EST REJET\u00c9E [145] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il travaille encore comme policier pour un petit service de police municipale au Nouveau-Brunswick. Il est possible que l'\u00e9valuation que la GRC a faite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ficiente ou incompl\u00e8te et que si sa candidature avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e, il aurait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ses fonctions et devoirs de membre de la GRC de fa\u00e7on comp\u00e9tente.\n[146] Quoi qu'il en soit, ce n'est pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal de se prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions de recrutement d'un employeur; son r\u00f4le consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite aux termes de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur de ces d\u00e9cisions. J'ai conclu que l'orientation sexuelle du plaignant et sa situation de famille n'\u00e9taient pas des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de rejeter sa candidature. De plus, il n'y avait pas de lignes de conduite fix\u00e9es ou appliqu\u00e9es susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi du plaignant. Sa plainte est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

CONCLUSIONS QUANT AUX FAITS TIR\u00c9ES LORS DE L'AUDIENCE INITIALE\nIV. LA D\u00c9CISION\nV. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Dans ses motifs de d\u00e9cision, dat\u00e9s du 6 novembre 2003 et qu'on retrouve \u00e0 2003 TCDP 37, le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 :\n[...] Autocar Connaisseur de prendre des mesures, de concert avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, pour \u00e9laborer une politique qui fera en sorte que les personnes atteintes d'une d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'usage d'alcool ou d'autres drogues qui obtiennent des r\u00e9sultats positifs \u00e0 la suite d'un test de d\u00e9pistage administr\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l'employeur feront l'objet de mesures d'accommodement, sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour la compagnie une contrainte excessive, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nEt ordonnant que :\n[...] dans les six mois suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, les parties d\u00e9posent devant le Tribunal des exemplaires de la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e d'Autocar Connaisseur en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage des drogues. Le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence en l'esp\u00e8ce pour trancher toute question non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties ne seraient pas capables de s'entendre sur les conditions de cette politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e.\n[2] Bien qu'elles aient fait de nombreuses tentatives, tant par \u00e9crit qu'au cours de rencontres, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables d'arriver \u00e0 un consensus \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de certaines questions se rapportant \u00e0 la politique de l'intim\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9pistage de drogues et d'alcool.\n[3] Compte tenu de l'impasse \u00e0 laquelle les parties sont accul\u00e9es, l'intim\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordonnance du Tribunal, demande maintenant que le Tribunal lui donne des directives \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de deux questions qui traitent, premi\u00e8rement, de la d\u00e9finition de l'expression poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et, deuxi\u00e8mement, de la question des mesures d'accommodement .\nII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE A. Les postes critiques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [4] La [TRADUCTION] Politique sur les drogues et l'alcool envisag\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9finit l'expression [TRADUCTION] poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comme un [TRADUCTION] poste dans lequel un individu a un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 et direct dans une activit\u00e9 pour laquelle une diminution de rendement due \u00e0 l'usage de drogues et d'alcool pourrait entra\u00eener un incident ou un accident important causant des d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou des blessures graves, des dommages mat\u00e9riels importants ou des dommages importants \u00e0 l'environnement. Aux fins de cette politique, les employ\u00e9s qui doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise, soit dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles, soit de temps \u00e0 autre, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme occupant un poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 .\n[5] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 mars 2004, la Commission a comment\u00e9 comme suit cette d\u00e9finition :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00ab\u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9finition de l'expression critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, je remarque que cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu modifi\u00e9, mais la Commission aurait besoin d'obtenir l'assurance que Motor Coach Canada ne fera pas subir des tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues \u00e0 ses m\u00e9caniciens qui font l'objet d'une surveillance r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Je sugg\u00e8re par cons\u00e9quent que la d\u00e9finition soit modifi\u00e9e de nouveau pour pr\u00e9voir que : les employ\u00e9s qui doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise, soit dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles, soit de temps \u00e0 autre, et qui ne font pas l'objet d'une surveillance r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme occupant un poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e indiqua ne pas partager l'opinion de la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette suggestion puisqu'elle estimait qu'elle \u00e9tait ambigu\u00eb. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 24 mars 2004, elle a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00ab\u00c0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9finition de l'expression poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, notre cliente n'est pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter la modification propos\u00e9e parce que la raison d'inclure les m\u00e9caniciens, qui dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles ou de temps \u00e0 autre conduisent des v\u00e9hicules, est que l'employeur a une obligation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public. L'ajout propos\u00e9 neutraliserait compl\u00e8tement l'objectif vis\u00e9 par ce qui est inclus puisqu'il est \u00e9vident que les m\u00e9caniciens font l'objet de surveillance lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans les installations de notre cliente et qu'il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident qu'ils ne font l'objet d'aucune surveillance que ce soit lorsqu'ils doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00bb.\n[7] Selon l'intim\u00e9e, la question n'est pas celle de savoir si les m\u00e9caniciens, en tant que m\u00e9caniciens, devraient faire l'objet de tests de d\u00e9pistage, mais celle de savoir si les m\u00e9caniciens qui sont chauffeurs de v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 moteur commerciaux et qui, dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur commercial devraient \u00eatre vis\u00e9s par la politique.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9e est d'avis que le Tribunal a clairement comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette question parce que lorsqu'un m\u00e9canicien, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur commercial, conduit un autobus, il ou elle est un chauffeur de v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur commercial et non un m\u00e9canicien. L'intim\u00e9e affirme qu'elle n'a pas l'intention que les m\u00e9caniciens qui ne sont pas des chauffeurs de v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur commercial soient vis\u00e9s par sa [TRADUCTION] Politique sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues et de l'alcool .\n[9] Selon la Commission, la question soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est celle de savoir si la [TRADUCTION] Politique sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues et de l'alcool qui est propos\u00e9e s'applique aux employ\u00e9s autres que les chauffeurs d'autobus commerciaux, \u00e0 savoir aux employ\u00e9s qui n'\u00e9taient pas vis\u00e9s par l'audience initiale du Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Commission adopte la position qu'il s'agit d'une question qui ne peut pas \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[10] La Commission renvoie au paragraphe 189 des motifs de la d\u00e9cision initiale du Tribunal dans lesquels le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nAvant de passer \u00e0 la question du redressement, nous d\u00e9sirons formuler quelques commentaires au sujet de la nouvelle politique d'Autocar Connaisseur en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage de l'alcool et des drogues. On se souviendra que cette politique, qui n'est entr\u00e9e en vigueur qu'en mars dernier, s'applique non seulement aux chauffeurs de la compagnie mais aussi \u00e0 ses m\u00e9caniciens. Cette politique n'est pas l'objet de la plainte de M. Milazzo et, \u00e0 notre avis, nous outrepasserions notre comp\u00e9tence si nous \u00e9tendions la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instance pour nous interroger sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des tests de d\u00e9pistage auxquels sont soumis les m\u00e9caniciens. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous n'avons aucune conclusion \u00e0 formuler au sujet de la nouvelle politique d'Autocar Connaisseur et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 propos de la question \u00e0 savoir si les tests de d\u00e9pistage administr\u00e9s aux m\u00e9caniciens de la compagnie sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires.\n[11] Le Tribunal a en outre mentionn\u00e9 qu'au cours de l'audience initiale, les parties ont consacr\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu de temps \u00e0 la question des tests de d\u00e9pistage pour les m\u00e9caniciens. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission affirme que la seule directive que le Tribunal peut fournir aux parties dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances porte sur le fait qu'elles ont tent\u00e9 tout ce qu'elles ont pu et qu'elles n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s'entendre sur l'\u00e9tendue de ce qui constitue un poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 .\n[12] La Commission pr\u00e9tend, en outre, que les m\u00e9caniciens sont surveill\u00e9s durant toute leur journ\u00e9e de travail sauf lorsqu'ils conduisent un autobus sur la route. La question dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire consiste \u00e0 tenter de trouver une fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9ussir syst\u00e9matiquement \u00e0 attraper ceux qui peuvent repr\u00e9senter un risque pour l'entreprise. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que lorsque les employ\u00e9s ne font pas l'objet de surveillance, ils devraient \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la politique. Bien que ce soit le cas pour les chauffeurs, la Commission affirme que ce n'est pas le cas pour les m\u00e9caniciens. Afin de surmonter ce probl\u00e8me, la Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les mots [TRADUCTION] et qui ne font pas l'objet d'une surveillance r\u00e9guli\u00e8re soient ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de [TRADUCTION] poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 .\nB. Les mesures d'accommodement [13] La question des mesures d'accommodement qui demeure non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e se rapporte \u00e0 la Partie IX de la [TRADUCTION] Politique sur les drogues et l'alcool , partie intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] Cons\u00e9quences d'une violation de la politique . La toute derni\u00e8re phrase de cette partie \u00e9nonce que [TRADUCTION] le d\u00e9faut de remplir ces conditions, y compris une deuxi\u00e8me violation de cette politique, entra\u00eenera la cessation de l'emploi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'entente . La Commission est d'avis que le mot [TRADUCTION] entra\u00eenera doit \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 dans cette phrase par les mots [TRADUCTION] peut entra\u00eener . Selon la Commission, la cons\u00e9quence rigoureuse impos\u00e9e par la politique dans le cas d'une deuxi\u00e8me violation pour une d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9pendance omet compl\u00e8tement de tenir compte de la loi et de l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement.\n[14] Cette question a \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9 la question de l'[TRADUCTION] Entente de la derni\u00e8re chance . Ces ententes touchent l'intim\u00e9e, le syndicat repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s et l'employ\u00e9 qui a obtenu des r\u00e9sultats positifs et qui a suivi un processus de r\u00e9adaptation. Selon cette entente, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 qui a achev\u00e9 son processus de r\u00e9adaptation obtient de nouveau des r\u00e9sultats positifs, il sera mis fin \u00e0 son emploi sans que d'autres mesures d'accommodement soient prises.\n[15] Le m\u00e9moire d'entente ou l'[TRADUCTION] entente de la derni\u00e8re chance d\u00e9pos\u00e9e comme preuve lors de l'audience \u00e9nonce, entre autres, ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] Le syndicat et le chauffeur [employ\u00e9] conviennent qu'il serait d\u00e9raisonnable pour l'employeur de prendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rendement du chauffeur des mesures d'accommodement autres que celles pr\u00e9vues dans cette entente et ils conviennent que l'obligation de l'employeur de prendre des mesures d'accommodement destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l'employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie . Le paragraphe 7 pr\u00e9voit de plus que : [TRADUCTION] Le syndicat et le chauffeur conviennent en outre que toutes autres mesures d'accommodement prises par l'employeur constitueraient une contrainte excessive au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne .\nIII. CONCLUSIONS QUANT AUX FAITS TIR\u00c9ES LORS DE L'AUDIENCE INITIALE [16] Il est important, afin de mieux comprendre la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des questions en litige actuelles, de rappeler certaines conclusions quant aux faits retenus lors de l'audience initiale, \u00e0 savoir :\n[20] James Devlin et Brian Crowe ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la situation dans l'industrie de l'autocar. M. Devlin est l'actuel pr\u00e9sident d'Autocar Connaisseur. M. Crowe est pr\u00e9sident de Motor Coach Canada, l'association professionnelle qui repr\u00e9sente les compagnies d'autocars et les organisateurs de voyages en autocar du Canada. Motor Coach Canada repr\u00e9sente environ 95 autocaristes et 115 organisateurs de voyages en groupe - de 75 % \u00e0 90 % de l'industrie canadienne de l'autocar.\n[21] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, environ 75 % des employ\u00e9s des compagnies d'autocars sont des chauffeurs. Les m\u00e9caniciens repr\u00e9sentent une autre tranche de 15 % ou de 20 %. Les autres travailleurs occupent des emplois de bureau. La plupart des compagnies d'autocars canadiennes sont relativement petites et sont des entreprises familiales.\n[22] L'industrie de l'autocar op\u00e8re sur demande . Selon M. Crowe, une compagnie d'autocars typique fonctionne 24 heures sur 24, sept jours sur sept. Comme l'a indiqu\u00e9 M. Crowe, l'industrie fournit des services lorsque les gens d\u00e9sirent se d\u00e9placer. De ce fait, les itin\u00e9raires sont tr\u00e8s impr\u00e9visibles; M. Crowe a donn\u00e9 comme exemple les voyages aux \u00c9tats-Unis, indiquant qu'il se peut fort bien qu'une entreprise n'aille pas du tout aux \u00c9tats-Unis un mois donn\u00e9, puis y fasse 20 voyages le mois suivant, en raison de la demande de la client\u00e8le.\n[23] Selon M. Crowe, cette capacit\u00e9 de s'adapter rapidement \u00e0 la demande des clients est l'une des forces de l'industrie de l'autocar.\n[24] M. Crowe a d\u00e9crit l'industrie canadienne de l'autocar comme une industrie en pleine maturit\u00e9. Autrement dit, la croissance dans ce secteur est faible. En fait, l'industrie est en perte de vitesse. M. Crowe a expliqu\u00e9 que les fournisseurs canadiens de services de transport par autobus nolis\u00e9 doivent faire concurrence \u00e0 des fournisseurs de services de transport fortement subventionn\u00e9s tels que les lignes a\u00e9riennes et Via Rail. La conjoncture internationale, notamment la guerre du Golfe, les attaques du 11 septembre, la guerre en Irak, l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie du SRAS et l'\u00e9pisode de la vache folle dans l'Ouest canadien sont autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont grandement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l'activit\u00e9 touristique dans l'industrie de l'autocar.\n[25] Les compagnies d'autocars \u00e9prouvent de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques en raison de l'\u00e9tat du march\u00e9. M. Crowe a expliqu\u00e9 qu'un autocar co\u00fbte 600 000 $. Les tarifs noliprix au Canada varient actuellement entre 500 $ et 700 $ par jour, avec le r\u00e9sultat que les compagnies d'autocars ont des marges tr\u00e8s minces. Cette situation a fait que ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es un certain nombre de compagnies d'autocars ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 faillite.\n[26] L'industrie canadienne de l'autocar est fortement r\u00e9glement\u00e9e. Autocar Connaisseur \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli au Qu\u00e9bec, c'est le cadre r\u00e9glementaire de cette province qui est pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[27] La Loi concernant les propri\u00e9taires et exploitants de v\u00e9hicules lourds (projet de loi 430) est entr\u00e9e en vigueur au Qu\u00e9bec en 1998. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par suite de l'accident d'autobus tragique survenu aux \u00c9boulements, lequel avait fait 40 victimes. Le projet de loi, qui visait \u00e0 accro\u00eetre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re, a institu\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me administratif d'inscription des propri\u00e9taires et exploitants de machineries lourdes, y compris les autobus. Ce r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation pr\u00e9voit notamment un suivi du comportement des exploitants inscrits. La Commission des transports du Qu\u00e9bec est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 imposer des mesures administratives aux exploitants dont la cote est conditionnelle ou insatisfaisante. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la Commission est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9voquer le permis d'exploitation des compagnies dont les comportements sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont jug\u00e9s fautifs, mesure qui, dans les faits, se traduit par leur mise en faillite. Tel qu'expliqu\u00e9 plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, Autocar Connaisseur faisait elle-m\u00eame l'objet, en 1999, de proc\u00e9dures li\u00e9es \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 devant la Commission des transports et risquait de perdre son permis d'exploitation.\n[28] L'une des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 institu\u00e9es par le projet de loi 430 est l'exigence voulant que les compagnies d'autocars indiquent sur les formulaires d'inscription si elles se sont dot\u00e9es d'un plan pour contrer la consommation d'alcool et de drogues chez les chauffeurs.\n[29] Les exploitants d'autobus sont \u00e9galement soumis \u00e0 de nombreuses autres obligations statutaires et, notamment, \u00e0 celles pr\u00e9vues par le Code canadien du travail, la Loi sur le transport par v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur (1987) f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et le Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[30] Le transport transfrontalier pose un d\u00e9fi particulier aux exploitants d'autobus \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ces derniers sont \u00e9galement assujettis aux lois am\u00e9ricaines, notamment \u00e0 celles portant sur les tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues.\n[...]\n[32] La loi am\u00e9ricaine exige que les chauffeurs qui conduisent des autobus aux \u00c9tats-Unis subissent des tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'emploi, effectu\u00e9s au hasard, \u00e0 la suite d'un accident ou pour une raison valable. L'ex\u00e9cution de ces tests est r\u00e9gie par une r\u00e9glementation stricte, et des protocoles rigoureux de collecte et d'analyse des \u00e9chantillons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s.\n[33] Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues dans l'industrie des transports avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9s dans le cadre de la guerre antidrogue am\u00e9ricaine. Quelles que soient les raisons de l'adoption de la loi, les chauffeurs qui conduisent des v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 moteur commerciaux aux \u00c9tats-Unis sont soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation du D\u00e9partement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des transports sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues et de l'alcool. Cette r\u00e9glementation s'applique \u00e9galement aux compagnies canadiennes dont les chauffeurs conduisent aux \u00c9tats-Unis, ainsi qu'\u00e0 tout chauffeur canadien qui est [TRADUCTION] raisonnablement susceptible de traverser la fronti\u00e8re . Selon Mme Butler, [qui est reconnue experte en \u00e9laboration et mise en uvre de politiques sur les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'alcool et aux drogues en milieu de travail] cela signifie tout chauffeur [TRADUCTION] qui peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 traverser la fronti\u00e8re, qui le fait ou qui le fera .\n[34] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Butler a indiqu\u00e9 que les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne traitent pas \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re les infractions : les compagnies sont passibles d'amendes pouvant atteindre 10 000 $ (US), par chauffeur, par voyage, si un chauffeur p\u00e9n\u00e8tre en territoire am\u00e9ricain sans avoir subi un test de d\u00e9pistage des drogues et de l'alcool. Des v\u00e9rificateurs du gouvernement am\u00e9ricain rendent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement visite aux compagnies d'autobus canadiennes afin de v\u00e9rifier que les voyages transfrontaliers sont effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime r\u00e9glementaire am\u00e9ricain. Les infractions flagrantes \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation am\u00e9ricaine peuvent entra\u00eener l'annulation de l'accr\u00e9ditation dont les compagnies d'autobus ont besoin pour circuler en territoire am\u00e9ricain.\n[...]\n[40] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l'industrie du transport par autobus au Qu\u00e9bec est sous la surveillance de la Commission des transports du Qu\u00e9bec. Vers la fin de 1997, M. Devlin a appris que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance-automobile du Qu\u00e9bec (SAAQ) avait entrepris des proc\u00e9dures contre Autocar Connaisseur devant la Commission des transports. De toute \u00e9vidence, la SAAQ cherchait \u00e0 faire annuler le permis d'exploitation d'Autocar Connaisseur en raison de la fa\u00e7on dont l'entreprise g\u00e9rait ses affaires. Les nouveaux propri\u00e9taires d'Autocar Connaisseur ont d\u00e9couvert que l'entreprise avait auparavant perdu son droit de certifier le bon \u00e9tat de ses autobus, en raison de d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurs avec la Commission des transports. Au dire de M. Devlin, on a s\u00e9rieusement song\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e0 mettre la cl\u00e9 dans la porte; finalement, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'essayer de travailler avec la SAAQ \u00e0 corriger la situation.\n[41] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Devlin a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une audience de justification de la Commission des transports en janvier 1999. \u00c0 cette audience, M. Devlin a d\u00e9crit les diff\u00e9rents programmes qu'il entendait mettre en oeuvre au sein de la compagnie, programmes qui portaient sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des v\u00e9hicules et la formation des chauffeurs. M. Devlin a inform\u00e9 la Commission qu'il faudrait de six \u00e0 neuf mois \u00e0 la compagnie pour se conformer totalement \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pertinente. \u00c0 la suite de l'audience, Autocar Connaisseur a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que toute autre infraction entra\u00eenerait l'annulation automatique de son permis d'exploitation. Une telle mesure sonnerait le glas d'Autocar Connaisseur.\n[42] L'une des mesures prises par Autocar Connaisseur pour se conformer aux engagements pris envers la Commission des transports consistait \u00e0 r\u00e9viser l'application de la politique de la compagnie en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage des drogues. [...]\n[...]\n[104] Finalement, il appartient \u00e0 Autocar Connaisseur d'\u00e9tablir que son refus de tol\u00e9rer des employ\u00e9s qui ont des m\u00e9tabolites de drogues dans leur syst\u00e8me alors qu'ils sont au travail est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre l'objectif de la compagnie de promouvoir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re en emp\u00eachant que des chauffeurs conduisent avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Afin de d\u00e9montrer que la norme de la tol\u00e9rance z\u00e9ro est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut prouver qu'Autocar Connaisseur est dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience dont les tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues donnent des r\u00e9sultats positifs, sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour l'entreprise une contrainte excessive.\n[105] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si la politique d'Autocar Connaisseur sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour promouvoir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re, il faut d'abord examiner le contexte professionnel dans lequel travaillent les chauffeurs d'Autocar Connaisseur.\n[106] M. Devlin a d\u00e9crit les fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conduite d'un autocar, expliquant que la vivacit\u00e9 d'esprit ainsi que la capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter de multiples t\u00e2ches sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels. En plus d'avoir \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule lourd \u00e0 travers la circulation, les chauffeurs doivent en tout temps \u00eatre conscients de la pr\u00e9sence des passagers. Par exemple, M. Devlin a dit que le chauffeur doit \u00eatre sur ses gardes lorsqu'un passager quitte son si\u00e8ge pour aller \u00e0 la toilette, car une manoeuvre brusque de sa part pourrait lui causer de graves blessures.\n[107] En outre, le contexte dans lequel travaillent les chauffeurs d'autocar fait en sorte qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile pour les compagnies d'autocars de s'assurer que ceux-ci sont toujours \u00e0 la hauteur de la t\u00e2che.\n[108] En ce qui concerne la jurisprudence portant sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues, les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient soumis \u00e0 une surveillance relativement \u00e9troite du fait qu'ils travaillaient dans les bureaux d'une banque (Banque Toronto-Dominion), dans des raffineries (Entrop) ou dans les bureaux administratifs d'une bande indienne (Elizabeth M\u00e9tis Settlement), contrairement aux chauffeurs d'Autocar Connaisseur qui passent une grande partie de leur temps sur la route, loin de l'oeil vigilant de leur sup\u00e9rieur. Les chauffeurs affect\u00e9s \u00e0 la desserte du Casino et des a\u00e9roports sont sur la route la majeure partie de la journ\u00e9e, tandis que ceux qui sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des voyages nolis\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9loign\u00e9s des bureaux d'Autocar Connaisseur pendant des p\u00e9riodes pouvant aller jusqu'\u00e0 30 jours. Bien que les chauffeurs communiquent chaque jour par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec les r\u00e9partiteurs d'Autocar Connaisseur, la compagnie n'est pas en mesure de v\u00e9rifier s'ils ont bel et bien fait les v\u00e9rifications n\u00e9cessaires avant le d\u00e9part, ou s'ils sont vraiment aptes \u00e0 conduire leur v\u00e9hicule.\n[...]\n[110] Cette impossibilit\u00e9 pour les dirigeants d'Autocar Connaisseur d'exercer une \u00e9troite surveillance sur les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie pose des difficult\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res lorsqu'il s'agit de surveiller leur rendement. Ces difficult\u00e9s sont d'autant plus grandes qu'une grande partie de l'effectif d'Autocar Connaisseur est en quelque sorte de passage puisque beaucoup de chauffeurs travaillent sur une base saisonni\u00e8re.\n[111] M. Crowe a d\u00e9crit la situation \u00e9conomique pr\u00e9caire dans laquelle se trouve l'industrie canadienne de l'autocar, indiquant que la situation chez Autocar Connaisseur n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de ce qu'elle \u00e9tait chez les autres compagnies d'autocars canadiennes. Comme l'a expliqu\u00e9 M. Devlin, la capacit\u00e9 d'Autocar Connaisseur d'exercer une surveillance sur ses employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait aussi limit\u00e9e par les contraintes financi\u00e8res auxquelles l'entreprise faisait face. M. Devlin a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le parc d'Autocar Connaisseur comprenait 125 autobus en 1999. M\u00eame si les recettes brutes de la compagnie en 1998 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'ordre de 10 millions de dollars, Autocar Connaisseur a en fait essuy\u00e9 d'importantes pertes. M. Devlin a vite constat\u00e9 que le march\u00e9 des services d'autocars nolis\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tait tout simplement insuffisant pour soutenir un parc de cette taille. Devant ce constat, Autocar Connaisseur a pris la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9duire la taille de son parc; la compagnie compte actuellement 29 v\u00e9hicules.\n[...]\n[119] Les Drs Baker et Chiasson ont tous deux d\u00e9crit dans leur t\u00e9moignage les effets de la consommation de cannabis sur le cerveau humain. Une fois de plus, ils ont essentiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord sur de nombreux points. L'ingr\u00e9dient actif du cannabis est le delta-9-t\u00e9trahydrocannabinol ou 9-THC. La concentration de 9-THC dans le cannabis qui circule au Canada aujourd'hui est beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que par le pass\u00e9, d'o\u00f9 sa puissance accrue.\n[...]\n[125] Les Drs Baker et Chiasson s'accordent \u00e0 dire que les personnes qui occupent des postes critiques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire des postes qui peuvent mettre en danger leur propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou celle d'autrui, devraient s'abstenir d'accomplir des t\u00e2ches comme la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur lorsque leur facult\u00e9 de conduire est affaiblie par l'usage de cannabis.\n[...]\n[128] En ce qui concerne l'industrie des transports, Mme Butler a affirm\u00e9 que peu de recherches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au Canada dans le domaine du d\u00e9pistage de l'alcool et des drogues du fait que le gouvernement canadien s'est abstenu d'intervenir au plan r\u00e9glementaire. Elle a cit\u00e9 une \u00e9tude men\u00e9e par la British Columbia Trucking Association en 1989. Au dire de Mme Butler, les trois quarts des chauffeurs sond\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'alcool avait compromis la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et un chauffeur sur neuf a admis avoir lui-m\u00eame jou\u00e9 avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail en consommant de l'alcool. Sept chauffeurs sur dix ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir travaill\u00e9 alors qu'ils \u00e9taient sous l'influence de l'alcool, et la moiti\u00e9 des chauffeurs ont dit conna\u00eetre d'autres chauffeurs qui buvaient au travail. En ce qui concerne les drogues, les trois quarts des chauffeurs sond\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'usage de drogues avait mis en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et un chauffeur sur douze a reconnu avoir lui-m\u00eame compromis la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail en consommant de la drogue.\n[129] Ces donn\u00e9es incitent certes \u00e0 croire que la consommation de drogues chez les chauffeurs dans l'industrie des transports constitue un probl\u00e8me v\u00e9ritable qui comporte d'importantes r\u00e9percussions au niveau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public.\n[...]\n[168] Il ressort clairement des t\u00e9moignages des Drs Baker et Chiasson qu'il n'existe aucune fa\u00e7on id\u00e9ale de d\u00e9pister les employ\u00e9s ayant les facult\u00e9s affaiblies ou de rep\u00e9rer ceux qui sont davantage susceptibles d'\u00eatre intoxiqu\u00e9s au travail. Bien que l'approche pr\u00f4n\u00e9e par le Dr Baker soit bonne, en principe, il est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Chiasson qu'elle ne permettra pas n\u00e9cessairement d' attraper tous les employ\u00e9s qui risquent de mettre en danger la vie des passagers. En outre, nous ne sommes pas persuad\u00e9s non plus que la m\u00e9thode du Dr Baker aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 applicable dans le contexte dans lequel Autocar Connaisseur se trouvait \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1999.\n[169] D'abord, la m\u00e9thode du Dr Baker repose dans une large mesure sur les observations des superviseurs. S'il est vrai qu'une telle m\u00e9thode puisse bien fonctionner dans une usine ou un bureau o\u00f9 les employ\u00e9s font l'objet d'une \u00e9troite surveillance, elle est moins pratique dans un milieu de travail comme celui qui existe chez Autocar Connaisseur, o\u00f9 les chauffeurs ne sont pas surveill\u00e9s la majeure partie du temps.\n[...]\n[171] M\u00eame si le fait d'obtenir des r\u00e9sultats positifs \u00e0 la suite d'un test de d\u00e9pistage des drogues n'indique pas n\u00e9cessairement, pour les raisons dont nous avons fait \u00e9tat ci-haut, que les facult\u00e9s du chauffeur pris en d\u00e9faut \u00e9taient vraiment alt\u00e9r\u00e9es durant son travail, nous sommes persuad\u00e9s que de tels r\u00e9sultats constituent un drapeau rouge , pour reprendre le terme utilis\u00e9 par le Dr Chiasson. La pr\u00e9sence de m\u00e9tabolites de cannabis dans l'urine d'un employ\u00e9 aide \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer les chauffeurs qui sont particuli\u00e8rement susceptibles d'avoir des accidents.\n[172] De surcro\u00eet, nous avons conclu que la pr\u00e9sence d'une politique de d\u00e9pistage des drogues contribue \u00e0 dissuader au moins certains employ\u00e9s de consommer de l'alcool ou des drogues au travail et de compromettre ainsi leur propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle d'autrui.\n[173] Pour ces motifs, nous croyons que la politique de d\u00e9pistage des drogues d'Autocar Connaisseur est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre la fin l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9e au travail que poursuit la compagnie, soit promouvoir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re.\n[174] Une autre raison nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que la politique de d\u00e9pistage des drogues d'Autocar Connaisseur est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire : l'obligation pour la compagnie de se conformer \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation am\u00e9ricaine en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage des drogues. [...]\n[175] Pour ces motifs, nous estimons qu'Autocar Connaisseur s'est acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau consistant \u00e0 prouver que le fait de soumettre ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 des tests de d\u00e9pistage pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'emploi ou effectu\u00e9s au hasard est une fa\u00e7on l\u00e9gitime de promouvoir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re.\n[176] Toutefois, notre analyse n'est pas termin\u00e9e. Selon les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer de la Cour supr\u00eame, Autocar Connaisseur, pour satisfaire au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, doit prouver qu'elle est dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder les employ\u00e9s dont les tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues sont positifs et qui souffrent d'une d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'usage des drogues, sans imposer \u00e0 l'entreprise une contrainte excessive.\n[...]\n[186] Toutefois, une compagnie comme Autocar Connaisseur devrait \u00e0 tout le moins offrir aux chauffeurs qui ont une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alcool ou des drogues et dont les tests se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent positifs les m\u00eames chances qu'\u00e0 ceux qui, de leur propre initiative, s'auto-identifient comme des alcooliques ou des toxicomanes. Autrement dit, ces personnes devraient avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de suivre un programme de r\u00e9adaptation et de retourner au travail lorsqu'elles seront aptes \u00e0 le faire. \u00c0 notre avis, la compagnie serait \u00e9galement justifi\u00e9e de se doter d'un m\u00e9canisme de suivi pour s'assurer que l'individu fautif continue de s'abstenir de consommer de l'alcool ou des drogues. Enfin, Autocar Connaisseur est peut-\u00eatre en mesure de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi des personnes qui ne se r\u00e9adaptent pas apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre vu offrir une chance raisonnable de le faire; toutefois, chaque cas doit \u00eatre soigneusement examin\u00e9.\n[...]\n[189] Avant de passer \u00e0 la question du redressement, nous d\u00e9sirons formuler quelques commentaires au sujet de la nouvelle politique d'Autocar Connaisseur en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage de l'alcool et des drogues. On se souviendra que cette politique, qui n'est entr\u00e9e en vigueur qu'en mars dernier, s'applique non seulement aux chauffeurs de la compagnie mais aussi \u00e0 ses m\u00e9caniciens. Cette politique n'est pas l'objet de la plainte de M. Milazzo et, \u00e0 notre avis, nous outrepasserions notre comp\u00e9tence si nous \u00e9tendions la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instance pour nous interroger sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des tests de d\u00e9pistage auxquels sont soumis les m\u00e9caniciens. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous n'avons aucune conclusion \u00e0 formuler au sujet de la nouvelle politique d'Autocar Connaisseur et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 propos de la question \u00e0 savoir si les tests de d\u00e9pistage administr\u00e9s aux m\u00e9caniciens de la compagnie sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires.\nIV. LA D\u00c9CISION [17] Nous traiterons d'abord de la question de la d\u00e9finition de l'expression poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 . Dans son projet de politique, l'intim\u00e9e a propos\u00e9 que la politique s'applique aux [TRADUCTION] employ\u00e9s qui doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise, soit dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles, soit de temps \u00e0 autre . La Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les mots suivants soient ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition :\n[TRADUCTION]\n\u00abet qui ne font pas l'objet de surveillance r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00bb.\n[18] Le tribunal ne partage pas l'opinion de la Commission selon laquelle ces mots sont n\u00e9cessaires dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l'audience initiale a \u00e9tabli clairement que l'une des raisons pour lesquelles l'intim\u00e9e voulait soumettre ses chauffeurs \u00e0 des tests de d\u00e9pistage des drogues et de l'alcool \u00e9tait que les chauffeurs d'autobus passent une grande partie de leur temps sur la route, loin de l'il vigilant de leur sup\u00e9rieur. Les chauffeurs peuvent \u00eatre sur la route pendant la plus grande partie de la journ\u00e9e ou pendant de plus longues p\u00e9riodes. Dans ces situations, l'entreprise est incapable de surveiller correctement ses chauffeurs. Le Tribunal est d'avis que le fait d'ajouter les mots que la Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s ne ferait rien de plus que cr\u00e9er de l'incertitude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du sens de l'expression surveillance r\u00e9guli\u00e8re .\n[19] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien \u00e9tabli dans la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l'audience initiale que l'incapacit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e de surveiller \u00e9troitement son personnel pr\u00e9sente des d\u00e9fis particuliers pour l'entreprise. De plus, il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la capacit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e de surveiller son personnel est limit\u00e9e par les contraintes financi\u00e8res de l'exploitation de l'entreprise.\n[20] Avant de passer \u00e0 l'autre question en litige, le tribunal souhaite ajouter que la d\u00e9finition de l'expression poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s'applique seulement aux employ\u00e9s qui ont un permis de chauffeur d'autobus et qui doivent conduire un autobus, soit dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles, soit de temps \u00e0 autre. Elle s'applique par cons\u00e9quent aux m\u00e9caniciens qui ont un permis de chauffeur d'autobus et doivent conduire un autobus dans l'exercice de leur travail.\n[21] Cela dit, nous r\u00e9it\u00e9rons que le Tribunal outrepasserait sa comp\u00e9tence s'il \u00e9tendait la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instance pour s'interroger sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des tests de d\u00e9pistage pour les m\u00e9caniciens ou d'autres employ\u00e9s qui n'ont pas de permis de chauffeurs d'autobus. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous ne tirons aucune conclusion \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si les tests de d\u00e9pistage pour ces employ\u00e9s sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires.\n[22] Quant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question en litige, elle concerne la Partie IX de la politique, partie intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] Cons\u00e9quences d'une violation de la politique . La derni\u00e8re phrase de cette partie \u00e9nonce que [TRADUCTION] le d\u00e9faut de remplir ces conditions, y compris une deuxi\u00e8me violation de cette politique, entra\u00eenera la cessation de l'emploi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'entente .\n[23] Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'utilisation du mot [TRADUCTION] entra\u00eenera impose une cons\u00e9quence inflexible \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une deuxi\u00e8me violation se rapportant \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9pendance. Dans notre d\u00e9cision initiale, nous avons clairement mentionn\u00e9, au paragraphe 186, que l'intim\u00e9e est peut-\u00eatre en mesure de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi des personnes qui ne se r\u00e9adaptent pas apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre vu offrir une chance raisonnable de le faire; toutefois, chaque cas doit \u00eatre soigneusement examin\u00e9 . [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Il est clair que, bien que nous avions l'impression que l'intim\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi d'un employ\u00e9 qui ne s'est pas r\u00e9adapt\u00e9, nous \u00e9tions d'avis que chaque situation devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e et justifi\u00e9e au cas par cas. Par cons\u00e9quent, afin de nous conformer \u00e0 notre d\u00e9cision initiale, nous ordonnons que les mots peut entra\u00eener remplacent le mot [TRADUCTION] entra\u00eenera dans la derni\u00e8re phrase de la partie intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] Cons\u00e9quences d'une violation de la politique , \u00e9tant la Partie IX de la [TRADUCTION] Politique sur les drogues et l'alcool .\n[24] La pr\u00e9sente affaire soul\u00e8ve en outre la question de l' entente de la derni\u00e8re chance . Comme la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l'audience l'a \u00e9tabli, l'intim\u00e9e exige maintenant de ses employ\u00e9s qui reviennent travailler apr\u00e8s avoir suivi un programme de r\u00e9adaptation pour les toxicomanes et les alcooliques qu'ils signent une [TRADUCTION] Entente de la derni\u00e8re chance , \u00e9galement appel\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] M\u00e9moire d'entente . L' Entente de la derni\u00e8re chance pr\u00e9voit qu'aucune autre mesure d'accommodement ne sera envisag\u00e9e et qu'il sera mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e si un employ\u00e9 obtient des r\u00e9sultats positifs lors de tests de d\u00e9pistage de l'alcool et des drogues apr\u00e8s avoir suivi un programme de r\u00e9adaptation.\n[25] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n'a pas trait\u00e9 de telles ententes dans le pass\u00e9. Toutefois, des arbitres et des commissions et des tribunaux provinciaux traitant des droits de la personne ont examin\u00e9 des ententes de la derni\u00e8re chance .\n[26] La d\u00e9cision ontarienne Ontario Human Rights Commission et al. and Gaines Pet Foods Corp. et al. (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 290, \u00e9tablit le droit fondamental \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette question. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e ill\u00e9gale et inapplicable dans le cas d'une employ\u00e9e aux prises avec une d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 son retour sur les lieux de travail. Dans cette affaire, la cour \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le retour sur les lieux de travail, apr\u00e8s une longue absence due \u00e0 ses traitements contre le cancer, d'une employ\u00e9e souffrant d'un cancer. \u00c0 son retour au travail, l'employeur a impos\u00e9 une condition restrictive \u00e0 ce qu'elle continue \u00e0 travailler, soit qu'elle devait maintenir un niveau de pr\u00e9sence [TRADUCTION] \u00e9gal ou sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moyenne des employ\u00e9s horaires dans l'usine . Tout d\u00e9faut de satisfaire \u00e0 cette norme entra\u00eenerait la fin de son emploi.\n[27] La cour a conclu que [TRADUCTION] la cause directe si elle n'\u00e9tait pas la cause principale de la condition restrictive [...] r\u00e9sultait directement de l'absence de Mme Black en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience [...] et que l'imposition de la condition restrictive \u00e9tait discriminatoire, d\u00e9coulant comme elle le faisait directement de son absence en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience [...]. Il s'agissait d'une condition qui n'\u00e9tait exig\u00e9e d'aucun autre employ\u00e9 et elle comportait la sanction d'une cessation d'emploi imm\u00e9diate dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un manquement .\n[28] La cour a de plus ajout\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] m\u00eame si on pouvait dire qu'elle avait consenti \u00e0 la condition restrictive, une telle entente serait inapplicable comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans une opinion incidente, dans l'arr\u00eat Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 que la l\u00e9gislature [...] a adopt\u00e9 [la loi en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne] dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'ensemble de la collectivit\u00e9 et de chacun de ses membres, et il est \u00e9vident que cette loi tombe dans la cat\u00e9gorie des lois auxquelles on ne peut renoncer ou qu'on ne peut modifier par contrat priv\u00e9 [...] .\n[29] La question d'un employ\u00e9 souffrant d'une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'alcool et de l'[TRADUCTION] entente de la derni\u00e8re chance a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision arbitrale Re: Camcar Textron Canada Ltd. and United Steelworkers of America Local 0222 (Commerford), (2001) 90 L.A.C. (4th) 305. Dans cette affaire, un employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 au travail suivant une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de retards et d'absences. \u00c0 la suite des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du motif ultime du cong\u00e9diement de l'employ\u00e9 et de la question de savoir si les absences ou les retards \u00e9taient dus \u00e0 l'alcoolisme, l'arbitre a conclu ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] pour les motifs examin\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Ottawa-Carleton, et qui r\u00e9sultent de la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Gaines Pet Foods [...], la question a un effet limit\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le manquement au Code r\u00e9sulte de l'imposition au plaignant, pour des motifs d\u00e9coulant de sa d\u00e9ficience, d'une norme, pour laquelle un manquement pour tout motif non express\u00e9ment exempt\u00e9 entra\u00eenerait des cons\u00e9quences des plus graves, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il ne peut y avoir de doutes que le manquement \u00e0 cette norme \u00e9tait la cause, en fait en l'esp\u00e8ce la seule cause, invoqu\u00e9e pour sa mise \u00e0 pied, et par cons\u00e9quent l'application de la norme discriminatoire, ind\u00e9pendamment des motifs qui ont conduit \u00e0 son manquement par le plaignant, doit faire l'objet d'un examen minutieux des dispositions du Code \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[30] Bien que ces d\u00e9cisions soient d'une certaine fa\u00e7on passablement diff\u00e9rentes de celle qui nous est soumise, elles soul\u00e8vent effectivement une question importante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de l'applicabilit\u00e9 de l' entente de la derni\u00e8re chance et de la possibilit\u00e9 que les parties se soustraient \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne ou renoncent \u00e0 certains droits pr\u00e9vus par cette l\u00e9gislation.\n[31] Dans la d\u00e9cision Re: Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Canadian Counsel of Railway Operating Unions (United Transportation Union) (2002), C.R.O.A., no 3269, (Picher), l'arbitre mentionne que bien que les ententes de la derni\u00e8re chance aient un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer comme outil de r\u00e9adaptation et dans certaines circonstances comme forme d'accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 souffrant d'une d\u00e9pendance, le manquement \u00e0 une telle entente ne peut l\u00e9galement r\u00e9sulter en un renvoi automatique. Chaque cas doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 selon son bien-fond\u00e9 et une conclusion selon laquelle un accommodement entra\u00eene une contrainte excessive doit \u00eatre tir\u00e9e pour que le cong\u00e9diement d'un employ\u00e9 souffrant d'une d\u00e9ficience soit justifi\u00e9.\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa jurisprudence canadienne ne confirme pas, cependant, que la violation d'une entente du type qui fait l'objet du grief doit automatiquement entra\u00eener le cong\u00e9diement d'un employ\u00e9. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que chaque cas doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 selon le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses faits particuliers et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, l'application d'une telle entente ne peut contrevenir \u00e0 l'obligation de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience, dans le respect de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne comme la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (Re Toronto Transit Commission and Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 114, (1990) 75 L.A.C. (4th) 180 (Davie); Re Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and Ottawa-Carleton Public Employees Union, Local 503 (2000) 89 L.A.C. (4th) 412 (Mitchnick); Re Camcar Textron Canada Ltd. and United Steelworkers of America, Local 3222, (2001) 99 L.A.C. (4th) 305 (Chapman)).\nComme la jurisprudence le refl\u00e8te, dans de nombreux cas, les arbitres concluront que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du traitement des employ\u00e9s, qui m\u00e8nent \u00e0 une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance, d\u00e9montrent qu'il y a eu suffisamment de mesures d'accommodement pour appuyer la conclusion que le fait de poursuivre une relation d'emploi entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive pour l'employeur. C'est l'analyse qui doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e dans chaque cas. Le simple fait qu'il y ait une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance ne confirme pas, en soi, s'il y a eu un respect suffisant de l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9tablie par la l\u00e9gislation d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 laquelle les parties ne peuvent pas se soustraire comme l'a statu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (Etobicoke (Municipalit\u00e9) c. Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 213.\n[32] Le Tribunal est en outre d'avis que m\u00eame sans la signature d'une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance, dans de nombreux cas, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du traitement des employ\u00e9s, le contexte de l'environnement de travail des chauffeurs d'autobus, l'importance de promouvoir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re et l'environnement r\u00e9glementaire de l'industrie du transport, comme ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve lors de l'audience initiale, refl\u00e9teront, selon les mots de la d\u00e9cision Re: Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Canadian Counsel of Railway Operating Unions (United Transportation Union), qu'il y a eu [TRADUCTION] suffisamment de mesures d'accommodement pour appuyer la conclusion que le fait de poursuivre une relation d'emploi entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive pour l'employeur . Mais, une fois de plus, nous r\u00e9p\u00e9tons que cette analyse doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e au cas par cas.\n[33] Le fait que les parties aient convenu d'une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance qui pr\u00e9voit qu'ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il serait d\u00e9raisonnable pour l'employeur de prendre des mesures d'accommodement autres que celles initialement prises et que toute autre mesure constituerait une contrainte excessive au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, [TRADUCTION] ne confirme pas, en soi, s'il y a eu un respect suffisant de l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9tablie par la l\u00e9gislation d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 laquelle les parties ne peuvent pas se soustraire . (Arr\u00eat Etobicoke (Municipalit\u00e9) c. Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 213.\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est d'avis que l' entente de la derni\u00e8re chance est inapplicable en fonction de la Loi. Comme la jurisprudence l'indique, une analyse doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e dans chaque cas afin d'\u00e9tablir s'il est possible pour l'employeur de prendre des mesures d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Bien qu'il soit certainement loisible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de mettre en garde ses employ\u00e9s qui reviennent au travail apr\u00e8s avoir suivi un programme de r\u00e9adaptation que toute rechute pourrait entra\u00eener leur cong\u00e9diement, l'imposition d'une entente de la derni\u00e8re chance ne peut servir \u00e0 neutraliser l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9tablie suivant la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\n[35] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que le concept de l'accommodement a ses limites. Ce point de vue a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 par Mme la juge Heneghan de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Ville d'Ottawa c. Desormeaux et Ville d'Ottawa c. Parisien, [2004 CF 1778]. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a souscrit \u00e0 ce que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question de l'accommodement quant \u00e0 l'absent\u00e9isme, dans l'arr\u00eat Scheuneman c. Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), (2000) 266 N.R. 154 (C.A.F.), dans lequel une autorisation d'interjeter appel \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, [2001] C.S.C.R. no 9 , \u00e0 savoir que :\n\u00ab [...] L'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux de la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 est que l'employ\u00e9 soit capable d'accomplir un travail pour l'employeur ou de recommencer \u00e0 travailler dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, s'il est temporairement invalide pour une cause m\u00e9dicale. Le cong\u00e9diement d'une personne qui ne remplit pas cette condition ne constitue pas de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience physique au sens de la Constitution \u00bb.\nLa juge Heneghan a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il arrive un moment o\u00f9 l'employeur peut l\u00e9gitimement dire que le march\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 .\n[36] Par cons\u00e9quent, en tant qu'employeur, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e0 subir un processus de r\u00e9adaptation sans fin. Il est bien possible qu'une deuxi\u00e8me violation de la politique entra\u00eenera la cessation de l'emploi qu'occupe une personne dans l'entreprise. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard devra \u00eatre prise au cas par cas.\nV. CONCLUSION Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut ce qui suit :\n(1) La d\u00e9finition de l'expression [TRADUCTION] poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui \u00e9nonce qu'un poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est un [TRADUCTION] poste dans lequel un individu a un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 et direct dans une activit\u00e9 pour laquelle une diminution de rendement due \u00e0 l'usage de drogues et d'alcool pourrait entra\u00eener un incident ou un accident important causant des d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou des blessures graves, des dommages mat\u00e9riels importants ou des dommages importants \u00e0 l'environnement. Aux fins de cette politique, les employ\u00e9s qui doivent conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise, soit dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions habituelles, soit de temps \u00e0 autre, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme occupant un poste critique pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 , est conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision initiale du Tribunal.\n(2) Bien que le Tribunal soit d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 qui n'a pas r\u00e9ussi sa r\u00e9adaptation, il est \u00e9galement d'avis que chaque situation doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e et justifi\u00e9e au cas par cas. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne que les mots peut entra\u00eener remplacent le mot [TRADUCTION] entra\u00eenera \u00e0 la Partie IX, intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] Cons\u00e9quences d'une violation de la politique de la [TRADUCTION] Politique sur l'alcool et les drogues de l'intim\u00e9e.\nPierre Deschamps, pr\u00e9sident\nMichel Doucet, membre\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 28 janvier 2005\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT713\/1802\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nSalvatore Milazzo c.

Paul Groarke\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Il y a entre les parties un litige quant aux questions qui devraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9es lorsqu'il est trait\u00e9 de redressement. Les parties ont demand\u00e9 une directive au Tribunal.\n[2] Je pense que je dois d\u00e9buter en disant que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un arbitre devrait refuser d'expliquer de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e une d\u00e9cision judiciaire. Cela ne fait que compliquer l'affaire. Il peut n\u00e9anmoins y avoir des cas dans lesquels il est utile de clarifier un point particulier. La pr\u00e9sente affaire est l'un de ces cas.\n[3] La question de fait entre les parties est relativement simple. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il aurait obtenu un poste permanent s'il y avait eu un concours \u00e9quitable. Dans ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la responsabilit\u00e9, j'ai conclu que la preuve n'appuyait pas cette th\u00e9orie de l'affaire. J'ai n\u00e9anmoins conclu ensuite, en l'absence d'une explication de la part de l'intim\u00e9, qu'il y avait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment discriminatoire dans le concours. Il ne s'ensuit pas que le plaignant aurait obtenu un poste permanent.\n[4] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, M. Bagambiire \u00e9num\u00e8re de nombreuses consid\u00e9rations qui militent en faveur d'une conclusion selon laquelle M. Brooks aurait obtenu un poste permanent. Je suis toutefois d'avis que cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve est s\u00e9lective. Le fait le plus troublant est qu'elle omet de reconna\u00eetre la simple insuffisance de preuve. Il s'agit d'un r\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9coulement du temps. De nombreux documents se rapportant au concours ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits et le dossier est incomplet. Il n'y a rien comme les renseignements requis pour se faire une opinion fiable quant \u00e0 ce qui se serait produit lors d'un concours \u00e9quitable.\n[5] M. Brooks devrait \u00eatre conscient du fait que je dois me limiter \u00e0 la preuve dont je dispose. Lorsque je m'en tiens \u00e0 cette preuve, et que j'\u00e9vite de faire des hypoth\u00e8ses, je suis convaincu qu'il \u00e9tait trop \u00e0 la fin de la liste pour que je puisse de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste conclure qu'il aurait obtenu un poste permanent. La jurisprudence du Tribunal et de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la question du traitement perdu n'est pas utile en l'esp\u00e8ce. La preuve ne sugg\u00e8re pas, s\u00e9rieusement ou autrement, que M. Brooks aurait obtenu un poste permanent. Elle sugg\u00e8re qu'il n'aurait pas obtenu un tel poste.\n[6] Il y a une d\u00e9claration dans les observations \u00e9crites selon laquelle la preuve [TRADUCTION] soulignait le fait que Richard Starr \u00e9tait un alcoolique. Cette d\u00e9claration touchait la r\u00e9putation de M. Starr plut\u00f4t que le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa participation au concours. Je pense que cette d\u00e9claration est teint\u00e9e d'iniquit\u00e9. Elle ne tient pas compte du fait que M. Starr n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et qu'il n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre. La preuve \u00e9tablissait simplement que d'autres individus, qui avaient eu un moins bon r\u00e9sultat que le sien lors du concours, avaient l'impression qu'il avait un probl\u00e8me d'alcoolisme.\n[7] Je ne vois aucune raison de se pencher sur les failles du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant. Dans les circonstances, cependant, je dois souligner qu'il doit supporter une partie de la responsabilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ses rapports tendus avec son employeur. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est qu'il a insist\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ent\u00eat\u00e9e pour avoir un poste permanent, presque du d\u00e9but de la longue s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont conduit \u00e0 la plainte. Il refuse apparemment d'accepter toute conclusion qui est contraire \u00e0 cette vue qui lui est ch\u00e8re.\n[8] La r\u00e9elle iniquit\u00e9 dans l'affaire est que les candidats retenus ont conserv\u00e9 leur poste permanent. Du point de vue de M. Brooks, le concours \u00e9tait arrang\u00e9. En fin de compte, M. Savoury s'en est sorti sans \u00eatre inqui\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n'y a rien dans cela qui \u00e9tablit cependant que M. Brooks aurait eu droit \u00e0 un poste permanent. Il est simplement trop tard pour revenir en arri\u00e8re, treize ans plus tard, et pour proc\u00e9der de nouveau au concours.\n[9] Quant \u00e0 la demande de directive, je pense que le Tribunal doit envoyer un message clair selon lequel il ne sera pas influenc\u00e9 par le refus plut\u00f4t obstin\u00e9 du plaignant d'accepter sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la responsabilit\u00e9. Ma position demeure fermement la m\u00eame et je suis convaincu, selon la preuve dont je dispose, qu'un poste permanent n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks. Les faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9s, la conclusion a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e et la doctrine du dessaisissement d'office s'applique. Je n'ai rien d'autre \u00e0 ajouter sur la question.\n[10] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 aux parties de fournir au Tribunal une liste de questions qui doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es \u00e0 fond lors de la reprise de l'audience.\nM.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La plaignante a prsent une requte visant modifier la plainte initiale qu'elle a dpose auprs de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 12 janvier 2003. La plaignante prtend dans sa plainte que son employeur, l'intime, a fait de la discrimination son endroit en raison de son tat matrimonial, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. L'poux de la plaignante, qui travaillait galement pour l'intime, a t congdi en novembre 2001. Il a par la suite intent une poursuite pour contester son congdiement. La plaignante prtend que, le 12 juin 2002, l'intime a rduit ses droits d'anciennet parce que son poux avait poursuivi l'intime. La Commission a renvoy la plainte au Tribunal le 19 aot 2004.\n[2] Le 22 novembre 2004, la plaignante a crit au greffe du Tribunal pour demander que sa plainte soit modifie afin d'inclure une allgation selon laquelle l'intime avait exerc des reprsailles son endroit en contravention de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Elle expliquait dans sa lettre que, depuis 2003, elle a dpos plusieurs plaintes auprs de l'intime l'gard de nombreuses questions se rapportant son emploi. Elle prtend que l'intime a choisi de ne pas traiter des proccupations exposes dans ses plaintes par reprsailles son endroit parce qu'elle avait dpos une plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[3] Le 12 novembre 2004, l'intime a congdi la plaignante. Elle prtend qu'elle a t congdie par reprsailles en raison de sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne et elle fait remarquer que la dcision de l'intime a t prise seulement quelques mois aprs que la Commission eut renvoy sa plainte au Tribunal.\n[4] Le congdiement est survenu peu aprs que la plaignante eut protest auprs de l'intime le 25 octobre 2004 l'gard de la mauvaise conduite allgue de plusieurs autres employs. L'intime a dclar dans son avis de congdiement la plaignante qu'il avait t dmontr que ses accusations taient non fondes et diffamatoires et avaient t faites avec la seule intention de discrditer les employs en question. L'intime jugeait ce comportement inacceptable et a congdi la plaignante sans autre avis ou dlai.\n[5] L'intime conteste la requte visant modifier la plainte relative aux droits de la personne. L'intime prtend que les nouvelles allgations de la plaignante sont non fondes et que, de toute faon, la question du congdiement de la plaignante n'a absolument aucun rapport avec la plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Selon ce que l'intime prtend, elle a t congdie non pas en raison de sa plainte, mais cause de la propagation de commentaires diffamatoires l'endroit d'autres employs de son lieu de travail. La plaignante prtend que cette explication est simplement un prtexte invoqu pour camoufler la vritable intention de l'intime, savoir se dbarrasser de la plaignante et de sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne en la congdiant directement.\n[6] Comme il a t mentionn dans la dcision Bressette c. Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 16, le Tribunal ne devrait pas, lorsqu'il value la question de savoir s'il doit accueillir une requte visant modifier une plainte, se lancer dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond de la modification. Un tel examen ne devrait tre effectu qu'aprs que le Tribunal a reu toute la preuve la suite d'une audience complte. Une modification devrait tre autorise sauf s'il est clair et vident que les allgations nonces cet gard ne peuvent possiblement pas tre acceptes.\n[7] Dans la prsente affaire, il ne me semble pas clair et vident que la plaignante serait incapable d'tablir qu'elle a t congdie par reprsailles sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Compte tenu des allgations comme elles ont t faites, rien n'empche qu'elle puisse dmontrer que les reprsailles constituaient au moins l'un des facteurs de son congdiement.\n[8] L'intime conteste l'affirmation de la plaignante selon laquelle les proccupations qu'elle avait souleves avant son congdiement n'ont jamais t traites. L'intime prtend au contraire qu'un bon nombre de ces questions ont t traites par le processus de grief ou autrement. L'intime peut certainement soulever ces points devant le Tribunal qui examine le fond de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, mais ces points ne font pas qu'il est clair et vident que les allgations modifies de la plaignante ne seront pas fondes.\n[9] De la mme faon, l'intime a mentionn dans ses observations crites qu'un grief avait t prsent au nom de la plaignante afin de contester son congdiement, grief dont l'issue tablira si son congdiement tait injustifi. L'intime semblait insinuer que toutes les proccupations de la plaignante seraient traites de cette manire. Cependant, il est loin d'tre certain que l'arbitre de griefs tirera des conclusions quant la question de savoir si l'article 14.1 de la Loi a t enfreint. Il n'est par consquent pas clair et vident que la plaignante sera empche d'tablir devant le Tribunal que ses allgations de reprsailles sont bien fondes.\n[10] Dans ses observations, l'intime a renvoy la dcision du Tribunal Uzoaba c. Canada (Service correctionnel) (1994), 26 C.H.R.R D\/361 (T.C.D.P.), confirme par (1995), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/428 (C.F. 1re inst.). Dans cette affaire, la Commission tentait de fournir des lments de preuve qui remontaient aussi loin que vingt ans avant la date de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne et qui se rapportaient des incidents qui n'taient pas expressment mentionns dans la plainte. Le Tribunal a conclu que compte tenu de l'coulement du temps et du vague souvenir que les tmoins avaient, de faon comprhensible, l'gard des vnements en question, il aurait t injuste d'accepter ces lments de preuve. L'intime prtend qu'il y aurait de la mme faon un prjudice pour elle si la porte de la prsente affaire s'tendait de faon inclure les allgations de reprsailles.\n[11] Cette prtention ne me convainc pas. La situation dans la prsente affaire n'est d'aucune faon similaire celle dcrite dans la dcision Uzoaba. Tous les incidents de reprsailles allgus dans la modification de la plaignante sont survenus aprs le dpt de la plainte et, en fait, il serait facile pour les tmoins de se souvenir de ces incidents plutt que de ceux se rapportant la plainte actuelle. En outre, la prsente affaire ne consiste pas tellement tendre la porte de la cause, mais plutt inclure une allgation additionnelle de discrimination qui par dfinition se rapporte directement l'actuelle plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Comme il a t mentionn dans la dcision Bressette, des individus ne devraient pas tre obligs de faire des allgations l'gard de reprsailles survenues aprs le dpt d'une plainte au moyen de procdures distinctes. Le bon sens veut que toutes ces allgations soient soumises au Tribunal en mme temps.\n[12] De plus, l'volution de la prsente affaire, de son renvoi jusqu' l'audience, est encore ses premires tapes. Les parties doivent encore changer leur expos de prcisions et fournir leur divulgation, conformment aux Rgles de procdure du Tribunal. De plus, la date de l'audience elle-mme n'est pas fixe. Par consquent, je suis d'avis que l'intime recevra un avis adquat l'gard de ce qu'il doit dmontrer et qu'il ne subira pas injustement un prjudice si la modification est autorise.\n[13] La requte visant modifier la plainte initiale prsente par la plaignante afin d'y inclure une allgation l'gard de reprsailles suivant l'article 14.1 de la Loi est par consquent accueillie.\nSign par Athanasios D.

Tweten, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e, RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. (RTL), le 13 novembre 1995. Au d\u00e9part, il \u00e9tait apprenti journalier. Il a quitt\u00e9 RTL pendant une p\u00e9riode et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 de nouveau en tant que m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde le 13 juin 1996.\n[2] RTL exploite une entreprise de camionnage et son si\u00e8ge social est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Yellowknife dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest. RTL a une succursale \u00e0 Edmonton, en Alberta, qui a un service de camionnage qui ramasse, charge et transporte des marchandises. La succursale d'Edmonton comprend un service de r\u00e9paration m\u00e9canique dans lequel M. Tweten r\u00e9parait de l'\u00e9quipement lourd.\n[3] Malheureusement, alors qu'il travaillait chez RTL, M. Tweten s'est bless\u00e9 au dos.\nII. LA PLAINTE DE DISCRIMINATION - LE 25 AO\u00dbT 1997 [4] M. Tweten s'est bless\u00e9 au dos alors qu'il r\u00e9parait une remorque le 25 ao\u00fbt 1997. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir de maux de dos. M. Tweten a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Seto, le lendemain. Il a alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la commission de l'indemnisation des accident\u00e9s du travail (la WCB). Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la WCB compte tenu de sa blessure au dos et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir des prestations de la WCB le 26 ao\u00fbt 1997.\n[5] M. Tweten s'est ensuite rendu \u00e0 un centre de r\u00e9adaptation et il a fait l'objet d'une \u00e9valuation par un orthop\u00e9diste. Le 14 novembre 1997, la WCB a conclu que M. Tweten \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer un travail [TRADUCTION] modifi\u00e9 et en a inform\u00e9 M. Art Brochu en r\u00e9pondant aux pr\u00e9occupations de RTL se rapportant aux contributions de l'employeur. La WCB n'a pas fourni d'autres d\u00e9tails \u00e0 M. Brochu \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'\u00e9tat de M. Tweten. La lettre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'\u00e9nonce pas les limites physiques ou les capacit\u00e9s de M. Tweten, les fonctions modifi\u00e9es ou les autres fonctions qu'il pourrait occuper.\n[6] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation, la WCB a mis fin aux prestations de M. Tweten en date du 17 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Le gestionnaire de cas de la WCB \u00e9tait d'avis que la douleur dont M. Tweten se plaignait \u00e9tait subjective et que la WCB ne pouvait lui offrir d'autres traitements pour l'aider \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa blessure \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il avait particip\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s \u00e0 deux programmes de r\u00e9adaptation. M. Tweten a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et il a finalement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir de nouveau des prestations de la WCB pour la p\u00e9riode du 18 d\u00e9cembre 1997 au 2 juillet 1999.\n[7] M. Tweten pr\u00e9tend que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin aux prestations de la WCB, il pouvait soulever un poids maximal de 50 livres. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a inform\u00e9 RTL de cette limite physique et qu'il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Art Brochu de lui donner du travail l\u00e9ger \u00e0 effectuer. Il pr\u00e9tend que RTL a refus\u00e9 cette demande et qu'elle permettait qu'il reprenne son travail que s'il \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 cent pour cent de ses capacit\u00e9s physiques et que s'il pouvait effectuer cent pour cent de ses fonctions. Il pr\u00e9tend que RTL a cat\u00e9goriquement refus\u00e9 de lui donner du travail modifi\u00e9 et qu'elle a plut\u00f4t mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\nIII. LES FAITS [8] En d\u00e9cembre 1997, apr\u00e8s que la WCB l'eut inform\u00e9 qu'il serait mis fin \u00e0 ses prestations, M. Tweten a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Brochu pour lui demander de lui donner du travail l\u00e9ger \u00e0 effectuer afin qu'il recommence \u00e0 travailler. M. Brochu l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il n'existait pas de programme de travail l\u00e9ger pour un m\u00e9canicien d'\u00e9quipement lourd. M. Brochu lui a dit qu'il exigeait qu'il lui fournisse une lettre de son m\u00e9decin exposant ses limites physiques et le travail qu'il pouvait effectuer sans se blesser de nouveau. M. Brochu lui a dit qu'apr\u00e8s qu'il aurait cette lettre, il \u00e9tablirait si RTL pouvait modifier un programme de travail pour lui. M. Tweten n'a jamais fourni une telle lettre \u00e0 RTL. Il n'a pas non plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brochu qu'il \u00e9tait capable de soulever un poids maximal de 50 livres.\n[9] M. Tweten n'\u00e9tait pas content de cette proposition et il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e (LTD) le 26 janvier 1998 aupr\u00e8s d'UNUM Canada. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 RTL de lui fournir la documentation n\u00e9cessaire pour remplir sa demande de LTD et RTL a coop\u00e9r\u00e9 avec lui en fournissant \u00e0 UNUM Canada les renseignements et les formulaires demand\u00e9s. M. Tweten avait re\u00e7u des prestations int\u00e9rimaires d'UNUM Canada du 26 ao\u00fbt 1997 au 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Par la suite, UNUM Canada a refus\u00e9 de lui verser d'autres prestations parce qu'il n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable d'effectuer chacune des fonctions importantes de son travail au cours de ce d\u00e9lai de carence de 120 jours.\n[10] Entre-temps, le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1998, M. Brochu a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tweten et lui a demand\u00e9 de venir \u00e0 son bureau pour discuter de ce qui peut constituer un travail l\u00e9ger pour un m\u00e9canicien d'\u00e9quipement lourd. M. Tweten \u00e9tait sur la d\u00e9fensive et a refus\u00e9 de coop\u00e9rer avec lui. M. Brochu lui a demand\u00e9 de remettre la cl\u00e9 de l'entreprise qu'il avait encore en sa possession. M. Tweten a mentionn\u00e9 que son p\u00e8re rapporterait la cl\u00e9 le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998.\n[11] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 1998, M. Brochu \u00e9tait \u00e0 Calmar, en Alberta, o\u00f9 M. Tweten r\u00e9sidait. Il lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et lui a demand\u00e9 de le rencontrer pour prendre un caf\u00e9. M. Tweten a refus\u00e9 de le rencontrer ou de remettre la cl\u00e9. M. Tweten a donn\u00e9 la cl\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC et il a dit \u00e0 la GRC d'informer RTL qu'il ne voulait plus entendre parler de nouveau de RTL \u00e0 moins que ce soit par \u00e9crit.\n[12] Apr\u00e8s cet incident, et compte tenu du fait que M. Tweten \u00e9tait all\u00e9 chercher ses outils sur le site de travail de RTL en soir\u00e9e en janvier 1998, RTL a jug\u00e9 que les actions de M. Tweten \u00e9quivalaient \u00e0 ce qu'il ait quitt\u00e9 son emploi. RTL a par la suite rempli un dossier d'emploi selon lequel M. Tweten avait cess\u00e9 de travailler pour RTL \u00e0 compter du 1er septembre 1997.\n[13] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, M. Brochu a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 M. Tweten de lui fournir un avis de son m\u00e9decin mentionnant express\u00e9ment le type de travail que M. Tweten \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer. Par la suite, il devait \u00e9tablir, le cas \u00e9chant, les mesures d'accommodement que RTL pouvait prendre pour M. Tweten. En d\u00e9pit de nombreuses demandes pour obtenir une lettre contenant un tel avis, M. Tweten n'a fourni \u00e0 aucun moment \u00e0 M. Brochu ou \u00e0 quiconque \u00e0 RTL une lettre comportant un avis m\u00e9dical ou d'autres renseignements exposant ses limites physiques.\n[14] Bien que M. Tweten ait fourni \u00e0 l'agent de RTL une autorisation d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses dossiers de la WCB, cette autorisation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e par RTL que pour traiter des questions de recouvrement de co\u00fbts devant la commission d'appel de la WCB et non pour v\u00e9rifier son dossier pour obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux quant \u00e0 ses limites physiques. Cette autorisation \u00e9nonce express\u00e9ment que la compagnie qui agit comme agent de RTL peut consulter le dossier afin de repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de RTL aux fins pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9es. RTL n'avait pas demand\u00e9 une autorisation \u00e0 d'autres fins et n'avait pas non plus acc\u00e8s au dossier de la WCB \u00e0 d'autres fins.\nIV. LE FONDEMENT DE MES CONCLUSIONS QUANT AUX FAITS [15] Les fondements de mes conclusions quant aux faits sont expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. T\u00e9moins profanes [16] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, et parce qu'il y a une contradiction entre les t\u00e9moignages rendus de vive voix par les t\u00e9moins, j'accorde plus d'importance \u00e0 la lettre du 18 f\u00e9vrier 1998 d'Art Brochu \u00e0 Christine Papenhuyzen1. Une copie de cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 M. Tweten, mais il n'en a pas contest\u00e9 le contenu par \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce moment. J'estime que cette lettre contient la meilleure preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente. De plus, lorsqu'il y a une contradiction entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tweten et celui de M. Art Brochu, un ancien employ\u00e9 de RTL qui travaillait en tant que g\u00e9rant de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au cours des p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier qui est le t\u00e9moin de RTL. J'estime que M. Brochu est un t\u00e9moin franc et direct. J'estime qu'il a agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable dans ses relations avec M. Tweten tant avant qu'apr\u00e8s la blessure au dos d'ao\u00fbt 1997. Apr\u00e8s que M. Tweten a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin aux prestations de la WCB, il n'a pas inform\u00e9 M. Tweten qu'il ne pouvait pas recommencer \u00e0 travailler. Au contraire, il a essay\u00e9 de le rencontrer pour discuter de la situation. En outre, il ne travaille pas actuellement pour RTL et il a fourni un r\u00e9cit ind\u00e9pendant des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui \u00e9taient survenus. De plus, son t\u00e9moignage est demeur\u00e9 le m\u00eame au cours du t\u00e9moignage principal et du contre-interrogatoire.\n[17] Inversement, j'estime que le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix de M. Tweten n'est pas digne de foi compte tenu de nombreux facteurs. Premi\u00e8rement, il avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat plus personnel dans la plainte. Il \u00e9tait sur la d\u00e9fensive et il avait une m\u00e9moire limit\u00e9e quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents. Son t\u00e9moignage n'\u00e9tait pas logique quant \u00e0 des points importants. Par exemple, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a demand\u00e9 au Dr Seto de lui fournir une lettre exposant ses limites physiques (contrairement au t\u00e9moignage et aux notes du Dr Seto), mais il n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante pourquoi il n'avait jamais fourni une telle lettre \u00e0 RTL. Un autre exemple est qu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne comprenait pas pourquoi il devait remettre les cl\u00e9s de l'entreprise \u00e0 RTL apr\u00e8s une absence de 6 mois. Il n'a pas non plus fourni une explication logique quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle il n'avait enregistr\u00e9 que certaines des conversations qu'il avait eues avec M. Brochu.\nB. Les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques enregistr\u00e9es [18] M. Tweten a enregistr\u00e9 certaines conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu'il a eues avec M. Brochu entre le 14 janvier 1998 et le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1998 et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les transcriptions de ces conversations comme pi\u00e8ces. J'estime que ces conversations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment engag\u00e9es par M. Tweten pour obtenir une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise de M. Brochu, \u00e0 savoir que M. Tweten souhaitait enregistrer une d\u00e9claration de M. Brochu selon laquelle il exigeait que M. Tweten puisse effectuer cent pour cent de ses fonctions avant qu'il puisse recommencer \u00e0 travailler. Je remarque qu'en d\u00e9pit d'une telle d\u00e9claration, M. Brochu confirme qu'il exige une note du m\u00e9decin de M. Tweten d\u00e9clarant qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 recommencer \u00e0 travailler. Je n'estime pas que ces conversations soient utiles et je ne leur accorde aucune importance.\nC. Le Dr Seto [19] J'ai de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'ind\u00e9pendance du Dr Seto. Au moins l'un des rapports m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Seto mentionne des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne sont pas inscrits dans ses notes au dossier. Bien que je lui aie donn\u00e9 la directive d'apporter son dossier original \u00e0 l'audience afin que l'avocat de RTL puisse l'examiner, le Dr Seto n'a pas suivi cette directive. Par la suite, il a inform\u00e9 la formation du Tribunal qu'il ne pouvait pas trouver le dossier et il a par cons\u00e9quent \u00e9vit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser le dossier aux fins d'examen par l'avocat de RTL. Le Dr Seto a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui n'\u00e9taient pas inscrits dans ses notes. Il s'est contredit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Dans l'ensemble, j'ai estim\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vague et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas digne de foi. M\u00eame M. Tweten a reconnu que le Dr Seto \u00e9tait r\u00e9ceptif \u00e0 des suggestions et il partageait mon opinion selon laquelle je ne pouvais accorder aucune importance \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage2. En outre, je n'accorde aucune importance \u00e0 son dossier et je mets en doute l'authenticit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 de ce dossier.\nV. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [20] Sur le fondement de mes conclusions quant aux faits, je vais traiter maintenant des questions de droit qui sont soulev\u00e9es.\n[21] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal r\u00e9sulte de la plainte de M. Tweten dat\u00e9e du 9 septembre 1998. Le point crucial de la plainte de M. Tweten porte sur la d\u00e9cision factuelle de savoir si RTL a refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 sa blessure au dos.\n[22] Les questions en litige sont les suivantes :\nRTL a-t-elle fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tweten en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne3? Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est affirmative, RTL a-t-elle \u00e9tabli un moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur l'exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ) en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 15a) de la Loi? RTL a-t-elle refus\u00e9 de prendre \u00e0 son endroit des mesures d'accommodement comme la Loi l'exige?\nSi RTL a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement, quelles sont les mesures de redressement qui devraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Tweten?\nVI. LE DROIT A. Le droit en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne [23] M. Tweten a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi, comme elle existait en date du 9 septembre 1998, se plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus \u00e0 la fin de 1997. L'article 7 de la Loi actuelle \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\nLa d\u00e9ficience est l'un des motifs de distinction illicite.\nL'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) \u00e9nonce le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur les exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es.\nNe constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es.\nLe paragraphe 15(2) \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\nLes faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1)g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nLe paragraphe 15(8) confirme que l'article 15 s'applique \u00e0 la discrimination directe et \u00e0 la discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[24] La Loi, comme elle existait au moment de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, ne comportait pas de dispositions \u00e9quivalentes aux paragraphes 15(2), 15(8) et 15(9) actuels. Les modifications \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ont pris effet en date du 30 juin 19984.\n[25] En 1999, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rendu l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. British Columbia Government and Services Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3, [Meiorin] et l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, [Grismer]. Dans ces deux arr\u00eats, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a remplac\u00e9 par une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e l'ancienne distinction faite par la jurisprudence entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte. Suivant la m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e, il appartient toujours au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui couvre les all\u00e9gations faites et qui, si on y ajoute foi, est suffisante et compl\u00e8te pour justifier une d\u00e9cision favorable au plaignant en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le plaignant, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la norme ou la politique discriminatoire est une EPJ. Afin de d\u00e9montrer qu'il s'agit d'une EPJ, l'intim\u00e9 doit prouver ce qui suit :\nil a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but ou objectif rationnellement li\u00e9 aux fonctions exerc\u00e9es. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re, mais sur l'objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, comme le besoin de travailler d'une mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. Lorsque l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution s\u00fbre et efficace du travail, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de consacrer beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape; il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse passe de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme \u00e0 la norme particuli\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame; la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'employeur puisse atteindre l'objet qu'il vise, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'ex\u00e9cution s\u00fbre et efficace du travail. L'employeur doit \u00e9tablir qu'il lui est impossible de prendre des mesures pour accommoder le demandeur et les autres personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive. L'employeur doit s'assurer que la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, d'examen de la question de l'accommodement traite de la possibilit\u00e9 de discrimination inutile fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite. De m\u00eame, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante offerte par l'employeur doit tenir compte de l'individu. Subsidiairement, l'employeur doit justifier les raisons pour lesquelles il n'a pas offert une telle norme.\n[26] Les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame Meiorin et Grismer nous renseignent \u00e9galement par leur \u00e9valuation de la question de savoir si un moyen de d\u00e9fense quant \u00e0 une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait remarquer que l'utilisation de l'adjectif excessive suppose qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable; seule la contrainte excessive r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re5. Du point de vue de l'employeur, il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al d'avoir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Mais, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, la norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques de chaque personne ainsi que de leur valeur et leur dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive. La Cour supr\u00eame a fait remarquer en outre qu'afin de prouver qu'une norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, un intim\u00e9 doit toujours d\u00e9montrer que la norme comporte toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. L'intim\u00e9 est tenu de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement. Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuel sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive.\n[27] Dans certains cas, un co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier un refus de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 l'endroit de ceux qui souffrent d'une d\u00e9ficience. Cependant, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d'importance \u00e0 l'accommodement. Il est beaucoup trop facile d'invoquer l'augmentation des co\u00fbts comme motif de refus d'accorder un traitement \u00e9gal. L'adoption de la norme de l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre appuy\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants. La preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions d'une augmentation des co\u00fbts ne suffit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas6. Des solutions non mon\u00e9taires, nouvelles et pratiques doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es. Finalement, des facteurs comme le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9thodes d'accommodement devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re souple et conforme au bon sens en fonction des faits examin\u00e9s7. Comme M. le juge Cory l'a fait remarquer dans l'arr\u00eat Chambly c. Bergevin, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 525, ce qui peut \u00eatre parfaitement raisonnable en p\u00e9riode de prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 est susceptible d'imposer \u00e0 un employeur un fardeau financier d\u00e9raisonnable en p\u00e9riode de restrictions budg\u00e9taires ou de r\u00e9cession. Je remarque que l'expression contrainte excessive n'est actuellement pas d\u00e9finie dans la Loi. Finalement, les employ\u00e9s ont une obligation d'aider \u00e0 arriver \u00e0 des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es et de faciliter la recherche de mesures d'accommodement8. Dans la d\u00e9cision Butler c. Nenqayni Treatment Centre Society, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 25, l'ancienne pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, alors qu'elle occupait cette fonction, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'omission de la plaignante d'avoir fourni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses limites physiques constituait un manquement de la plaignante \u00e0 son obligation de faciliter la recherche d'une mesure d'accommodement. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la recherche de l'accommodement exige que toutes les parties touch\u00e9es par le processus fassent des concessions. Cela fonctionne dans les deux sens.\n[28] En retournant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 trancher, soit celle de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le tribunal doit instruire la plainte suivant les articles 49 et 50. Cette instruction doit \u00eatre ind\u00e9pendante, impartiale et tenir compte de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et de la l\u00e9gislation pertinente. Le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l'Environnement) (C.A.), [2003] 4 C.F. 580. La Cour d'appel a confirm\u00e9 que les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer ont tous deux examin\u00e9 la question des effets des normes ou des politiques distinctes ou explicites qui servent d'outil de s\u00e9lection, c'est-\u00e0-dire une norme de la capacit\u00e9 a\u00e9robique qui constitue de la discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit des femmes par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et une norme d'acuit\u00e9 visuelle pour la d\u00e9livrance de permis de conduire qui constitue de la discrimination directe. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait une distinction entre ces cas et ceux dont les rapports entre les parties ne sont pas dict\u00e9s par une politique pr\u00e9existante. Plut\u00f4t, il y avait une ligne de conduite selon laquelle les parties se fondaient sur une interpr\u00e9tation des droits et obligations qu'elles avaient respectivement. Dans l'arr\u00eat Hutchinson, il \u00e9tait difficile d'isoler et de d\u00e9celer une politique ou une norme particuli\u00e8re. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour a commenc\u00e9 son analyse en concluant que la politique en question faisait une distinction entre des personnes qui \u00e9taient touch\u00e9es d'une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9judiciable pour un motif de distinction illicite. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que lorsqu'il est question d'une ligne de conduite, la question la plus pertinente consiste \u00e0 savoir si les rapports entre les parties, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, entra\u00eenent un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Si les rapports consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent aucun traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, l'examen prend fin. S'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il existe un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l'examen des trois questions dont l'analyse de la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Dans l'arr\u00eat Hutchinson, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnablement loisible pour la Commission de conclure que les rapports entre l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient aucun traitement pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[29] En outre, dans l'arr\u00eat Hutchinson la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 qu'un plaignant n'a pas le droit de tenir ferme quant \u00e0 la solution de rechange pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e. Dans cette affaire, l'intim\u00e9e a fait des efforts pour accommoder la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante en l'installant ailleurs, en l'employant sur une base saisonni\u00e8re, en encourageant un environnement libre d'odeurs et en offrant \u00e0 la plaignante d'effectuer du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a suivi l'arr\u00eat Ontario (Ministry of Community and Social Services) c. OPSEU (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 560, dans lequel la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a conclu que la [TRADUCTION] Politique relative \u00e0 l'observation religieuse de l'employeur \u00e9tait suffisante pour accommoder les besoins individuels des personnes pratiquant une religion minoritaire. Un employ\u00e9 avait revendiqu\u00e9 le droit d'avoir un cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour lui permettre d'observer onze cong\u00e9s religieux. La politique de l'employeur pr\u00e9voyait deux jours de cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pour l'observation religieuse et accordait des jours de cong\u00e9 additionnels au moyen de changements d'horaire et de jours de cong\u00e9 accumul\u00e9s au moyen de la semaine de travail comprim\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 a pris la position selon laquelle ses jours de cong\u00e9 accumul\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la semaine de travail comprim\u00e9e \u00e9taient des jours qu'il pouvait utiliser comme il le jugeait bon, l'employeur pouvant lui accorder onze jours de cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pour l'observation religieuse sans contrainte excessive. La Cour a statu\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la politique de l'employeur \u00e9tait suffisamment inclusive pour accommoder l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, la question de l'accommodement au point o\u00f9 il y avait contrainte excessive ne se posait pas. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que l'un des corollaires de cette position est que l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 ne peut pas refuser une solution raisonnable pour le motif que la solution de rechange qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re n'imposera pas une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l'employeur.\nVII. ANALYSE A. Le d\u00e9faut d'\u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie et le manquement par le plaignant \u00e0 l'obligation de faciliter l'accommodement [30] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les rapports, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, entre M. Tweten et RTL ne constituaient pas un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable par RTL \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tweten. RTL a reconnu la d\u00e9ficience de M. Tweten et elle a tent\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diligente de le rencontrer pour discuter d'accommodement. M. Tweten a refus\u00e9 de faciliter une telle rencontre et a omis de fournir \u00e0 RTL les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux quant \u00e0 ses limites physiques.\n[31] En particulier, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, M. Tweten avait une blessure au dos et avait par cons\u00e9quent une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi. Cependant, RTL n'a pas refus\u00e9 de l'employer en raison de sa blessure. Plut\u00f4t, M. Tweten a volontairement choisi de quitter RTL. Il n'a pas pris contact avec RTL \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un retour au travail. Il ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail en d\u00e9cembre 1997 ou par la suite et il est all\u00e9 chercher ses outils en janvier 1998.\n[32] RTL n'a pas non plus contrevenu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi. RTL n'a pas d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Tweten. Plut\u00f4t, RTL a coop\u00e9r\u00e9 avec M. Tweten en lui conservant son poste dans l'attente de son retour au travail apr\u00e8s sa blessure et en l'aidant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des formulaires d'invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. De plus, RTL a essay\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, sans succ\u00e8s, de rencontrer M. Tweten pour discuter du statut de son emploi et de retour au travail, mais M. Tweten a refus\u00e9 de rencontrer M. Brochu.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) ou de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[34] Finalement, m\u00eame si RTL avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tweten, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9, RTL a fait des efforts pour rencontrer M. Tweten pour discuter de ses besoins d'accommodement m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que M. Tweten eut omis de fournir une lettre exposant ses limites physiques. En omettant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande l\u00e9gitime de RTL, M. Tweten a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de faciliter la recherche d'un accommodement valable. RTL a agi de bonne foi en tout temps. Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je ne suis pas d'avis que l'autorisation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la WCB donnait \u00e0 RTL ou \u00e0 son agent un acc\u00e8s illimit\u00e9 au dossier de M. Tweten. M. Tweten pr\u00e9tend que suivant l'ancien article 141 de la Workers' Compensation Act de l'Alberta, RTL avait le droit de consulter son dossier m\u00e9dical. Cet article limite clairement l'acc\u00e8s de l'employeur aux renseignements qui sont pertinents \u00e0 une question faisant l'objet d'un contr\u00f4le ou d'un appel et restreint le droit de la commission des accident\u00e9s du travail de divulguer des renseignements \u00e0 un employeur \u00e0 des points se rapportant \u00e0 une telle question. Les questions des besoins d'accommodement sur les lieux de travail d'un employ\u00e9 ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par l'\u00e9tendue de cet article et le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif envisag\u00e9 par cette loi. De plus, il n'est pas raisonnable dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire d'exiger que RTL \u00e9crive \u00e0 la WCB pour v\u00e9rifier ses dossiers afin d'\u00e9tablir les limites physiques de M. Tweten. M. Brochu a fait de bonne foi des efforts pour obtenir directement de M. Tweten les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s. Tout ce que M. Tweten devait faire c'\u00e9tait obtenir de son propre m\u00e9decin une d\u00e9claration exposant ses limites physiques. M\u00eame apr\u00e8s que M. Tweten eut omis de fournir une lettre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Brochu, de bonne foi, a fait de nombreux efforts pour le rencontrer et discuter de son emploi et des mesures d'accommodement qu'il demandait. Il ne s'agit pas d'un cas dans lequel M. Tweten a souffert de d\u00e9ficience mentale qui l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de coop\u00e9rer dans la recherche d'un accommodement. M. Tweten n'a aucunement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e2che \u00e0 laquelle toutes les parties en cause devaient prendre part, soit trouver une mesure d'accommodement valable. Il ne s'est aucunement engag\u00e9 sur une voie bilat\u00e9rale.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la demande de M. Tweten dans son ensemble.\nShirish P.

Grant Sinclair, pr\u00e9sident Pierre Deschamps, membre\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] CEP a l'intention d'appeler sept t\u00e9moins au soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention de pr\u00e9judice moral suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Bell Canada demande que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance obligeant ces t\u00e9moins \u00e0 divulguer leurs dossiers m\u00e9dicaux couvrant les ann\u00e9es 1990 \u00e0 2004.\n[2] Les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux que Bell tente d'obtenir incluent toutes les notes cliniques consign\u00e9es et tous les rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par tout m\u00e9decin traitant, psychiatre ou autre professionnel de la sant\u00e9 et tous les dossiers de la RAMO ou de la RAMQ se rapportant \u00e0 chacun des t\u00e9moins. Bell tente en outre d'obtenir tous les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux dont tout h\u00f4pital ou tout autre \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9 a la possession ou la garde, y compris toutes les notes cliniques consign\u00e9es et tous les rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par tout m\u00e9decin, psychiatre ou autre professionnel de la sant\u00e9 travaillant pour tel h\u00f4pital ou tel \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9, ou faisant partie de son personnel, au cours de la p\u00e9riode, et tous les dossiers de la RAMO ou de la RAMQ dont tel h\u00f4pital ou tel autre \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9 a la possession ou la garde.\n[3] Dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 20 novembre 2003 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Bell, CEP d\u00e9clare que les t\u00e9moins qui seront appel\u00e9s rendront des t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences \u00e9motionnelles, psychologiques et financi\u00e8res qu'a eu sur eux la d\u00e9cision de Bell de ne pas mettre en application les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude conjointe. Dans une lettre subs\u00e9quente dat\u00e9e du 1er octobre 2004, CEP ajoute que ces t\u00e9moins fourniront de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi, des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, du stress et de la frustration caus\u00e9s \u00e0 eux et \u00e0 d'autres membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation en raison de la discrimination qu'ils ont subie.\n[4] Bell soutient que ces t\u00e9moins, par leur pr\u00e9tention de pr\u00e9judice moral, ont forc\u00e9ment mis leur \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 respectif en cause et qu'ils doivent divulguer leurs dossiers m\u00e9dicaux.\n[5] CEP s'oppose \u00e0 la demande de Bell en soutenant qu'une demande d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral ne touche pas n\u00e9cessairement l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un individu et ne donne pas automatiquement droit \u00e0 la divulgation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. CEP affirme ne pas avoir l'intention de pr\u00e9senter de la preuve m\u00e9dicale au soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention de pr\u00e9judice moral. Ses t\u00e9moins n'all\u00e9gueront pas qu'ils ont obtenu des soins m\u00e9dicaux en raison de la discrimination et, selon CEP, la demande de Bell est une intrusion inutile dans leur vie priv\u00e9e.\n[6] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne s'oppose \u00e9galement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Bell. Elle adopte int\u00e9gralement les observations de CEP.\n[7] Au soutien de sa demande, Bell s'appuie principalement sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., non publi\u00e9e, 3 janvier 2001 (T558\/1600) (TCDP). Les avocats de Bell renvoient en outre le Tribunal aux arr\u00eats Hay c. University of Alberta Hospital (1990), 69 D.L.R. (4th) 755, Frenette c. M\u00e9tropolitaine, Cie d'assurance-vie, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 647, et A.(M.) c. Ryan, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 157.\n[8] Au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions, CEP s'appuie essentiellement sur l'arr\u00eat Ryan de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[9] Le Tribunal n'est pas d'avis qu'une pr\u00e9tention de pr\u00e9judice moral met n\u00e9cessairement l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause et n\u00e9cessite la pr\u00e9sentation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux.\n[10] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral sans avoir entendu de t\u00e9moignage se rapportant \u00e0 de la preuve m\u00e9dicale et sans avoir ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Druken et al. c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration), 8 C.H.R.R. D 4379, Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, 9 mai 2003, Vlug c. SRC, D.T. 6\/00, 15 novembre 2000, et Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 21, 5 juin 2003). Les tribunaux et les cours s'appuient souvent sur le t\u00e9moignage d'une personne de m\u00eame que sur l'ensemble de la preuve pour accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[11] Cela ne veut pas dire que l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un individu et que ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux ne seront jamais pertinents dans une pr\u00e9tention de pr\u00e9judice moral. Des affaires comme l'affaire McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd, 15 novembre 2001 (TCDP), illustrent cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[12] Dans la d\u00e9cision McAvinn, la plaignante a clairement mis son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait obtenu des soins m\u00e9dicaux pour l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 dont elle avait souffert en raison de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[13] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape de l'instance, contrairement \u00e0 l'affaire McAvinn, le Tribunal ne dispose pas de preuve d\u00e9montrant que les t\u00e9moins que CEP a l'intention d'appeler ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu des soins m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du pr\u00e9judice moral. En fait, CEP a clairement adopt\u00e9 la position que ces t\u00e9moins n'all\u00e9gueront pas avoir re\u00e7u des soins m\u00e9dicaux en raison de la discrimination dont ils pr\u00e9tendent avoir fait l'objet de la part de Bell.\n[14] Cependant, les deux lettres de CEP montrent que les t\u00e9moins qui doivent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s ont l'intention de rendre un t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences \u00e9motionnelles, psychologiques et financi\u00e8res reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de Bell de ne pas se conformer aux r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude conjointe (la lettre de CEP dat\u00e9e du 23 novembre 2003) et propose de fournir de la preuve \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi, des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, du stress et de la frustration caus\u00e9s \u00e0 eux et \u00e0 d'autres membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation (la lettre de CEP dat\u00e9e du 1er octobre 2004).\n[15] \u00c0 notre avis, il n'est pas \u00e9vident que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux des individus qui seront appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre un t\u00e9moignage fourniraient des renseignements pertinents quant aux difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res que ces individus ont pu avoir en raison du comportement de Bell. On peut dire la m\u00eame chose \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la frustration et de l'atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi.\n[16] Les cons\u00e9quences \u00e9motionnelles et psychologiques du comportement de Bell pour ces t\u00e9moins et le stress qu'ils ont pu subir en raison de ce comportement sont plus probl\u00e9matiques. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux des t\u00e9moins peuvent ou non \u00eatre utiles \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de Bell. En effet, Bell peut peut-\u00eatre mieux atteindre ses buts par un contre-interrogatoire que par la divulgation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et l'intrusion dans la vie priv\u00e9e des t\u00e9moins qui y est rattach\u00e9e.\n[17] Le Tribunal n'est pas en mesure en ce moment de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la divulgation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux quant \u00e0 ce qui touche les cons\u00e9quences psychologiques et \u00e9motionnelles ou le stress. Toute d\u00e9cision sera, si n\u00e9cessaire, rendue dans le contexte du t\u00e9moignage de chaque t\u00e9moin et suivant la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle la preuve sera expos\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 par J.
