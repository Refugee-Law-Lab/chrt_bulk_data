Another issue at stake in the present is the impact on the process as a whole.\nThe Respondent\u2019s position in sum is as follows:\n[2] The Respondent argues that the evidence brought forward by this additional witness goes directly to a key area of this case being the Complainant\u2019s poor performance and that it is relevant. The Respondent specifies that he will tender evidence to prove that the Complainant\u2019s lay-off was selected as a result of a bona fide comparison of the two Brandon RASRs pursuant to the collective agreement. The outcome of this analysis resulted in finding that the Complainant\u2019s skills, abilities, performance and qualifications were inferior to the other employee and that there is a noted distinction in performance between the two incumbents.\n[3] In his arguments, the Respondent says that his witnesses, already on the list for the hearing, made a bona fide comparison of the incumbents and learned that the Complainant had a history of not getting along with those that she reported to, including Account Managers. The Respondent wishes to bring the new witness following the Complainant\u2019s testimony in which she alleged that she \u201cgot along good\u2019\u2019 with her Account Managers and disputed the trend of performance in her 2003 and 2004 performance appraisals.\n[4] In addition, the Respondent argues that evidence will be put forward to support its position that one aspect of the Complainant\u2019s poor performance was her inability to get along with those she reported to, including her Account Managers. The Respondent also says that given the fact that his position relies on the previous arguments, the Account Manager\u2019s testimony will assist the Tribunal in finding the truth and is probative of the merit that the Complainant did not get along with those she reported to.\n[5] Lastly, the Respondent argues that without that additional witness, the Tribunal will be left with performance appraisals, the Complainant\u2019s testimony and her supervisor that the Respondent anticipates will say the appraisals were filled out honestly and that the Complainant got along well, with the proposed additional witness.\nAnalysis\n[6] This issue addresses the credibility of the Complainant on a statement she made on the stand on getting along with others including the additional witness requested by the Respondent. The Complainant was cross-examined by the Respondent. The Respondent already planned to prove that the Complainant had a history of not getting along with those that she reported to, including Account Managers. The Respondent could have easily anticipated this argument or testimony. Moreover; the Respondent did anticipate it and sent a letter the Complainant\u2019s counsel on October 28 prior to the hearing starting November 1 in that line of thought. The letter mentioned that if the Complainant would question the contents of the performance appraisals, a request would be made to the Tribunal to call new witnesses. The Respondent will have the opportunity to bring evidence with his witnesses that are already on the list. Other than the comment on leaving the Tribunal with having to decide with the Complainant\u2019s testimony and the performance appraisals and a manager that might concur, the Respondent did not explain why the other witnesses scheduled for appearance before the Tribunal cannot bring evidence on this aspect of the case. More importantly, even if it is an aspect of the issue at stake, I do not think it is prejudicial if it is not adduced with a new witness. The prejudice the whole process would bear outweighs the potential prejudice made to the Respondent.\n[7] The Complainant-witness has completed her testimony and is no longer under oath. I note the efforts of the Respondent to detail the will-say and narrow the issues in asking the addition of only one of the two Account Managers but I do not wish to delay the hearing any further in addressing a motion to reopen the Complainant\u2019s testimony or adding any other witnesses.\n[8] The Respondent will have a full opportunity to present his evidence and to cross-examine all remaining witnesses of the Complainant.\n[9] The additional witness requested by the Respondent is not available on the hearing dates already scheduled and this would increase the delay for the hearing.\n[10] It is the Tribunal\u2019s role to evaluate the proper weight to give to the evidence put forward by the Complainant in the perspective of all the evidence. With the evidence that I have heard from the Complainant and, keeping in mind the substantial issues of this case, I do not consider it crucial to hear from an additional witness.\n[11] The Tribunal has the discretion according to the Rules of Procedure to allow additional witnesses\u2019, if required, once the hearing has started but must use its discretion in accordance with other considerations. This issue must be considered in light of the public interest in having complaints of discrimination dealt with expeditiously (Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada et al., (1997) F.C.J. N0, 207 (F.C.T.D.);\n[12] The exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of natural justice, and the regime of the CHRA. It has not been shown how the result sought by the Respondent better accords with natural justice, nor how it better advances the legislative objectives of the inquiry process, in particular, expeditiousness, and the granting to all parties of a full and ample opportunity to participate (CHRA s. 50(1)).\n[13] For all of the above reasons I rule as follows:\nThe Respondent\u2019s request for leave and to add a new witness is denied.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJanuary 7, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1452\/7809\nStyle of Cause: Heather Lynn Grant v.

Introduction [1] This is the third decision by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) arising out of an inquiry into complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) by pilots George Vilven and Robert Kelly that they had been subjected to a discriminatory practice resulting from mandatory retirement at age 60, in accordance with provisions in a collective agreement between Air Canada Pilots\u2019 Association (ACPA) and Air Canada.\n[2] At the date of his retirement on September 1, 2003, at age 60, Mr. Vilven was a First Officer when flying an Airbus 340. Mr. Kelly retired on April 30, 2005, the day on which he turned age 60. At the time of his retirement, Mr. Kelly was a Captain and Pilot-in-command when flying an Airbus 340.\n[3] The first decision of the Tribunal was rendered in August 2007, and dismissed the human rights complaints. On judicial review, the first decision was quashed in part, and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal for re-determination of a Charter issue and, if necessary, whether mandatory retirement provisions constituted a bona fide occupational requirement within the meaning of s. 15(1)(a) of the CHRA.\n[4] The second decision of the Tribunal was rendered on August 28, 2009 (2009 CHRT 24). A judicial review of this decision by the Federal Court resulted in a Judgment by Justice Mactavish, dated February 3, 2011, ordering, among other things, that:\n3. Air Canada\u2019s application for judicial review is granted, in part, as it relates to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Air Canada had not demonstrated that age was a bona fide occupational requirement for its pilots.\n4. The question of whether age was a bona fide occupational requirement for Air Canada pilots after November of 2006 is remitted to the same panel of the Tribunal, if available, for re-determination in accordance with these reasons, on the basis of the existing record.\n[5] As the same panel of the Tribunal was not available to proceed with the re-determination as ordered, I have been asked to re-determine the question of whether age was a bona fide occupational requirement for Air Canada pilots after November 2006, in accordance with the reasons for judgement of Justice Mactavish, and on the basis of the existing record. In the course of my re-determination, I have read and considered Justice Mactavish\u2019s reasons for judgement and I have examined and considered, in its entirety, the evidence of Captain Steven Christopher Duke (Captain Duke), a witness called by Air Canada on the issue of accommodation.\n[6] With respect to the evidence of Captain Duke, Justice Mactavish commented in paragraph 429 of her Reasons that:\nAs was noted earlier, Air Canada says that the Tribunal misunderstood and mischaracterized the evidence put forward by Captain Duke in support of its undue hardship argument. Air Canada also contends that the Tribunal ignored important portions of Captain Duke\u2019s evidence as to the operational and scheduling difficulties that would result if Air Canada were required to accommodate pilots over the age of 60. \u2026;\nAnd in paragraph 384:\nI also agree with Air Canada that having regard to the systemic nature of Messrs. Vilven and Kelly\u2019s human rights complaints and the fact that the potential invalidation of the mandatory retirement provisions in the Air Canada Pension Plan and the Air Canada\/ACPA collective agreement would affect other Air Canada pilots, it was also appropriate for the Tribunal to examine the issue of undue hardship on a going-forward basis, taking into account the subsequent changes to the ICAO standards\u2026\nII. The Applicable Law A. Canadian Human Rights Act Provisions 3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice,\nor\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n[7] In her reasons for judgment, Justice Mactavish summarizes the legal principles governing bona fide occupational requirements (at paras. 353-358):\nThe test to be applied for determining whether an employer has established a bona fide occupational requirement is that articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin [British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, (1999) 3 S.C.R. 3]\nThat is an employer must establish on a balance of probabilities that:\n(1) The employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\n(2) The employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\n(3) The standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\nThe first and second steps of the Meiorin test require an assessment of the legitimacy of the standard\u2019s general purpose, and the employer\u2019s intent in adopting it. This is to ensure that, when viewed both objectively and subjectively, the standard does not have a discriminatory foundation.\nThe third element of the Meiorin test involves the determination of whether the standard is required to accomplish a legitimate purpose, and whether the employer can accommodate the complainant without suffering undue hardship: McGill University Health Centre v. Syndicate des employe-e-s de l\u2019Hopital general de Montreal, 2000 (SCFP-FTQ) 2007 SCC 4, 1 S.C.R 161, at para.14.\nAs the Supreme Court of Canada observed in Hydro-Quebec v Syndicat des employe-e- s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Quebec, section locale 2000 (SCFP \u2013FTQ), 2007 SCC 43, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 561, the use of the word \u201cimpossible\u201d in connection with the third element of the Meiorin test had led to a certain amount of confusion. The Court clarified that what is required is \u201cnot proof that it is impossible to integrate an employee who does not meet a standard, but proof of undue hardship, which can take as many forms as there are circumstances\u201d: at para.12.\nAs to the scope of the duty to accommodate, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cThe employer does not have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way, but does have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee\u2019s workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work\u201d: Hydro Quebec, at para. 16.\u201d\n[8] Further, Justice Mactavish determined that subsection 15(2) of the CHRA should be interpreted as limiting the factors to be taken into account in an accommodation analysis to health, safety and cost. However she qualified her determination with the following observation:\nThat is not to say that matters such as employee morale and mobility, interference with other employees\u2019 rights, and disruption of a collective agreement could never be relevant in a claim under the CHRA. My interpretation of the legislation simply means that in order to be taken into account in an accommodation analysis, these matters must be of a sufficient gravity as to have a demonstrable impact on the operations of an employer in a way that relates to health, safety or cost.\nIII. The Evidence [9] Of significance in my re-determination is the November 23, 2006 change to the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN organization charged with fostering civil aviation safety \u2013 Canada is a signatory \u2013 a change which makes it mandatory that Captains\/Pilots-in-Command between the ages of 60 and 65 may continue to fly internationally, but only if one of the other pilots in a multi-pilot crew is under 60.\n[10] The ICAO standards apply only to international flights. The vast majority of Air Canada flights have an international aspect, 86% are either to an international destination or pass through foreign (primarily American) airspace, en route to a Canadian destination. Between 20 and 25% of the remaining 14% of Air Canada flights have an American airport as an alternate airport where planes are to land if, for example, weather precludes landing at the regularly-scheduled Canadian airport.\n[11] Captain Duke testified on behalf of Air Canada regarding its likely inability to accommodate pilots over age 60 if the ICAO \u201cone pilot over 60\/one pilot under 60\u201d requirement (over\/under rule) becomes applicable to scheduling the company\u2019s pilots.\n[12] In the time period relevant to this matter Captain Duke was employed by Air Canada in a managerial position with Flight Operations. Among his qualifications, Captain Duke is recognized as a Six Sigma Black Belt in management processes. He testified that Six Sigma is a business improvement process which originated in the late 1980s at the Motorola and General Electric corporations which has been adopted by Air Canada. The description of Captain Duke as a \u201cBlack Belt\u201d is in recognition of his expertise in this process.\n[13] Captain Duke began his testimony by outlining several detrimental consequences, including an unavoidable and inevitable increase in pilots and the cost of flight operations, that would burden Air Canada if mandatory retirement of pilots on their reaching age 60 was eliminated: a) inability to accommodate captains over age 65 on international and domestic flights; b) a very limited capacity to accommodate captains or first officers who are over age 60; c) loss of the capability of accurately predicting hiring and training needs in advance and the effect that will have on Air Canada.\n[14] Captain Duke testified that Air Canada\u2019s pilots, approximately 3200 in December 2006, are grouped according to the aircraft they fly:\n(1) largest aircraft, mostly on international routes, Airbus-345-500, A-340-300 and A-330 (generally referred to as A-340s);\n(2) Boeing 767, 777 on some international routes;\n(3) A-320\u2019s and A-319\u2019s;\n(4) Embraer 190 and 175.\n[15] Captain Duke explained that the A-340 series and the Boeing 767 require three pilots in the cockpit, one being a relief pilot.\nSo our 3200 pilots break down into 16\u2026non-interchangeable groups, which are then geographically divided into 42 unique positions. \u2018Position\u2019 is a collective agreement term that is defined as a unique combination of equipment, status and base. For example: the Boeing triple-7 captain in Toronto would be one position; Montreal, the captain, there are only 35 of them. If we go further down the list, the other extreme of the most populous position would be the A-320 Toronto captains with 363 of them. So at any given time these groups are non-interchangeable. We can\u2019t move pilots back and forth \u2013 they are stuck with their assignments.\nThey can move a little bit between base, for example if we have a Montreal A-320 captain and they are flying out of Toronto, we can move them to Toronto to do that flying, but we cannot have any A-320 captain fly a 767 or an A-320 first officer act as an A-320 captain.\n[16] In his evidence Captain Duke explained the choices available to a pilot with a hypothetical seniority number of 1100: He or she could choose to be a middle of the pack A-320 captain flying middle-of-the-pack schedules or get more money as a very junior 767 captain and suffer the schedule of a junior captain. Captain Duke pointed out that with increasing seniority it is the pilot, alone, who chooses whether to become a very senior A-320 captain or a junior 767 captain.\n[17] Captain Duke described a typical career path for Air Canada pilots: starting off either as a relief pilot or a narrow-body aircraft first officer, then moving to a wide-body first officer position, a return to a narrow-body aircraft as a captain, and a final move back to a wide-body captaincy, having spent five to seven years in each block, to end their careers at age 60. Captain Duke noted that within each block pilots can switch between positions.\n[18] Captain Duke testified about the correlation between the Marketing and Flight Operations departments of Air Canada:\nWe are a marketing driven company and our Marketing Department produces a lengthy list of the flights that they want Flight Operations to conduct in the coming months. We have people called Pairing Analysts and there is one assigned per fleet type. So there is one for the 340, one for the 767. What they do is, they take this monstrous list of flights they wish us to conduct and they break that down into smaller usable chunks that consist of a series of flights that will combine to cover a one-day period or anywhere up to a four-day period.\n[19] Captain Duke then described a typical pairing in the Toronto A-320 group: Flight 700 leaving Toronto at 6:30am, arriving New York just before 8am. Forty minutes later it becomes Flight 705, New York to Toronto, arriving at 10:10am. The pilots then have two hours and 40 minutes before their next flight departs Toronto as Flight 177 for Edmonton, arriving at 3 pm Mountain time. After spending the night in Edmonton the pilots depart the next day at 7am and fly to Toronto:\nThat is a typical and an actual two-day pairing for the Toronto 320 pilots to fly. The thing to note about this pairing is it is a mix of international and domestic flying.\n[20] Captain Duke explained that the pairing analyst\u2019s goal is to link flights that have a reasonable period of time between them, the above-mentioned two hours and 40 minutes being at the upper end of waiting time for pilots, and noted that there are other guarantees in the collective agreement that move the company to make the pilot\u2019s time more productive when they are working.\n[21] Duke then described the process carried out by Flight Operations after the Marketing Department stipulates its flight requirements. Once the General Manager of Crew Resources receives the Marketing Department list of flights \u201cshe will spend anywhere from two weeks to a month fine-tuning the number of positions that she needs to cover.\u201d After that, the Crew Manning Steering Committee (CMSC), a joint company-union committee, approves the plan as presented or as amended, triggering a two-week period for pilots to update their Standing Preferential Bid in light of the opportunities presented to them in the schedule of planned flights, and to engage in bidding for positions. Based on Captain Duke\u2019s evidence, I infer that seniority is absolutely essential in enabling pilots to take the initiative in controlling their careers with Air Canada.\n[22] Captain Duke described the working relationship between Flight Operations and the Marketing Department from the perspective of the CMSC, which conducts its review twice each year in accordance with the collective agreement:\nThe thing to notice is we put out a training plan that works 12 months ahead and then six months later we do this again \u2026 we are working toward this plan but never get there. We get halfway there and we start again. It is a very dynamic environment (in which) our Marketing Department tries to be very sensitive to what the consumers are accepting for our product and so they are changing their plans constantly. That is one side of the equation; on the other side is Flight Operations which takes a long time to respond to the changes. \u2026Our way of meeting their need (is) by amending our position list every six months \u2026 allow(ing) us the security \u2026 of knowing what we are doing for the next six months before the CMSC review starts again. It is a compromise between the two different branches of the company.\n[23] Captain Duke gave extensive evidence concerning anticipated scheduling difficulties and costs that Air Canada would likely experience if mandatory retirement at age 60 was ended. He testified that Air Canada would have to employ more pilots to ensure absolute compliance with the over\/under rule on all international and partially international flights.\n[24] Duke testified that he had conducted computer experiments on the premise that Air Canada no longer had the certainties of mandatory retirement of pilots at age 60. In one of the experiments, Captain Duke tried to schedule flights for pilots over age 60 who would be subject to the over\/under rule, and concluded that as the number of pilots over age 60 increases, scheduling becomes unworkable.\nChair: \u201cBecause \u2026?\u201d\nDuke: \u201cBecause our software cannot solve the problem: there are not enough unrestricted pilots to fly with the other unrestricted pilots.\u201d\n[25] Duke then presented a graph which he identified as Air Canada\u2019s Vancouver A-340 captains, ranking them in order of seniority, which showed that 85% of the Vancouver captains were age 55 or older. He reasoned that if mandatory retirement at age 60 was abolished, then in the ensuing five years 85% of these captains would be in a potentially restricted age range, i.e. beyond 60 but not yet 65, and thus subject to the over\/under rule restricting them from international flights unless the pilot flying with them was under 60.\n[26] Captain Duke described a similar problem facing Vancouver-based A-340 first officers:\n\u2026 For example the pilot that the far left dot represents who is 57 years old, if he stays \u2026five years to age 62 \u2026(he) will be restricted from flying with the other captains\u2026.\nWhen the monthly schedule bid happens they can pretty much pick and choose whatever they want. They are\u2026senior, they get first choice at things. Well, now not necessarily, because we run our captain schedule first and if all the flying you want has other potentially restricted pilots in it, you can\u2019t fly with those people. So your seniority rights are being impacted by being potentially restricted from flying with the captains on the flying that you are looking for.\n[27] Air Canada\u2019s Toronto-based A-340 pilots were similarly analyzed, 78% of them being age 55 or older. In five years they also would be in the potentially restricted range. Captain Duke found that similar demographics applied to Vancouver and Toronto based pilots flying the Boeing 767.\n[28] Captain Duke continued his analysis, assuming that 10% of the captains and first officers were restricted by the over\/under rule. It is significant that the resulting simulated schedule disregarded the seniority of many first officers and assigned them to reserve-pilot status. He testified that as relief pilots they would not be able to relieve an ill first officer assigned to fly with a captain aged over 60.\nWhen we deal with a small base such as the Vancouver A-340 the number is shockingly small. With 20% of the captains restricted and 11% of the first officers restricted \u2026We can\u2019t generate a schedule.\nMember Jensen: \u201cUnless you hire an additional pilot.\u201d\nDuke: \u201cThat is our obvious response to that \u2026 to somehow introduce more pilots who are not restricted ... Of course our current system is based on seniority, so this would go back \u2026 to the CMSC review. \u2026Lets say you open up two more spots \u2026the CMSC review is run \u2026 if those two new pilots are 62 years old, you haven\u2019t helped yourself at all, because we don\u2019t have the right as it were to restrict pilots based on age from obtaining these positions \u2026 We can\u2019t guarantee through any method in our collective agreement that we would have less than 11% first officers restricted.\u201d\n\u2026\nTremblay: \u201cWhat does that do to pilot morale if you ignore the seniority list in order to overcome or minimize \u2026 some of these problems?\nDuke: \u201cSeniority is one of ACPA\u2019s most dearly held concepts and we have repeatedly had this mentioned to us at the negotiating table. Depending on how much we restricted it, it would be anywhere from negative to very negative. If suggestions such as (to) directly hire people to a position that is as senior as the Vancouver A-340 first officer, it could bring the airline to a halt. We could have wildcats the likes we haven\u2019t seen before. \u2026we wouldn\u2019t even try to bring something like that forward.\u201d\n\u2026\nTremblay: \u201cHas Air Canada experienced wildcats or issues of that kind because of pilot morale issues related to seniority before?\nDuke: \u201cDuring the merger, that didn\u2019t go smoothly as far as the pilots were concerned because we had a disagreement between the Canadian pilots and the Air Canada pilots as to how the two seniority lists should be merged. We had various versions of sickouts associated with various Labour Board rulings with that \u2026we had a taste of the effect of playing with seniority and how it affect the pilots\u2019 morale.\u201d\n[29] Captain Duke testified that mandatory retirement of pilots at age 60 gives Air Canada stability and predictability with respect to hiring and training needs, and that there is an operational risk associated with changing retirement from age 60:\nWe plan on pilots retiring at age 60 and we have CMSC reviews based on that; and we train (pilots) based on that \u2026 So if we push retirement from age 60 to a higher limit or no limit we are going to be potentially stuck with unexpected retirements because nothing in the collective agreement causes our pilots to give us notice of when they are going to retire. It will detrimentally affect Air Canada\u2019s operation and result in increased costs.\n[30] When asked by Member Jensen whether Air Canada could impose a retirement-notice requirement on its pilots Captain Duke responded that Air Canada has no power to unilaterally impose anything on pilots, that it would have to be negotiated with ACPA, and \u201cthat it would take a lot of bargaining capital on the company\u2019s behalf, starting from scratch, to negotiate something like that.\u201d\n[31] Member Jensen also wanted clarification on Captain Duke\u2019s evidence concerning the need to have predictability in retirement:\nJensen: \u201cJust so I\u2019m clear, when you say it is one of our biggest issues, what you mean there is (that) the predictability of retirement is one of the biggest problems with not having a mandatory retirement date; is that right?\u201d\n[32] Duke agreed, and using the Vancouver A-340 group as an example said that Air Canada has:\n\u2026 six people worth of work in Vancouver that allow us to absorb external shocks to our operation. Once we pass that number \u2013 all our assumptions working out on sickness, on the amount of people in training, on the number of supervisors we have, all the assumptions we have in staffing \u2013 six is the magic number that we can use to absorb external shock such as early retirements. Any more than that and we are cancelling flights. So to directly answer your question, the issue is planning the number of staff we need; and at the senior positions we are currently the beneficiaries of a regular retirement pattern in our planning, we know when they are going to retire and they do retire pretty much on schedule. If we were to lose that through the Tribunal ordering a change to mandatory retirement and us not being able to successfully address that with ACPA, we would have to buy some insurance somehow by having extra pilots in these positions.\n[33] Captain Duke testified that given the restrictiveness of ICAO\u2019s over\/under rule, and absent age-60 mandatory retirement, Air Canada\u2019s Flight Operations would experience significant increases in pilot costs and complications in scheduling.\n[34] In dealing with the prospect of scheduling domestic flights for pilots over age 65, Captain Duke testified that it was not feasible, in that 86% of these flights customarily fly over parts of the United States:\nSo if we have to reroute domestic flights that otherwise would over fly the U.S. to keep them solely within Canadian airspace, \u2026that is going to \u2026increase the time en route, which increases the costs and additionally makes the next flight of the day late, which we are deadly against.\nIn extreme cases, (for example) Vancouver to Toronto, with an A-320 which is near the top of the range, if we have to put more fuel on board we may have to take passengers off because the plane may be at its maximum weight limit.\n[35] Captain Duke gave precise information concerning extra fuel costs, citing 62 Toronto to Halifax flights, each one costing an additional $1,695 equating to $5.5 million per year.\n[36] Concerning one experiment he conducted, a worst case scenario, to determine the consequence of accommodating pilots over age 65 by using them exclusively on domestic flights, Captain Duke testified that \u201c\u2026 it has the same problems that we saw on the Toronto\/Halifax issue \u2026 you end up with 1,700 hours of additional pairings needed to fly the exact same schedule.\u201d He explained that when the pairing analysts have to split the flying schedule into two groups to accommodate ICAO restricted captains, it negates optimization, which is the minimization of inherent costs by generating effective pairings. Captain Duke testified that having two groups of pilots to cover the same schedule, one group restricted by the over\/under rule, creates a situation that requires employment of 42 more pilots, and that these additional pilots would themselves need reserve coverage factored at 34%, bringing the increase in reserve coverage to 56 pilots, each costing $11,500 per month, equating to $7.7million per year.\nIV. Re-Determination [37] The parameters of this re-determination were stated by Justice Mactavish In paragraphs 469, 470 and 471 of her reasons for judgement:\n469 I have already found that the Tribunal\u2019s finding with respect to the bona fide occupational requirement issue as it related to the period before November of 2006 was reasonable. Consequently, any error on the part of the Tribunal with respect to the first two elements of the Meiorin test is immaterial as it relates to that time frame.\n470 However, I have found that there were a number of errors in the Tribunal\u2019s bon fide occupational requirement analysis as it related to the post-November 2006 period, rendering this aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s decision unreasonable.\n471 As a result, the question of whether being under 60 was a bona fide occupational requirement for Air Canada pilots after November of 2006 will be remitted to the same panel of the Tribunal, with the direction that the issue must be examined in light of all three elements of the Meiorin test.\n[38] Accordingly, this re-determination is limited to the period after November 2006.\n[39] There is nothing in the record of the previous proceedings to suggest that the Tribunal, or the reviewing Judge, found that Captain Duke lacked credibility. Based on my review of his evidence, I am satisfied that he was a credible witness. Further, I find that his evidence is convincing and cogent.\n[40] Captain Duke\u2019s testimony has established, on a balance of probabilities, that elimination of mandatory retirement of pilots at age 60, either through a final determination of this case or through revision of the collective bargaining agreement, will carry with it a heavy burden to achieve full compliance with ICAO\u2019s over\/under rules.\n[41] It is more likely than not that the scheduling of pilots over age 60 will become markedly less efficient and more costly as compared with the certainty that the company has experienced with mandatory retirement requirements which have been in place since 1957. I accept Captain Duke\u2019s succinct assessment of the over\/under rule: \u201cIt is the conditionality of the restriction that causes the problems.\u201d\n[42] Captain Duke\u2019s description of the workings of Air Canada Flight Operations reveals a practical and efficient balancing between the Marketing Department flight requirements and Flight Operation\u2019s ability to assign pilots to them. He testified that the elimination of the mandatory retirement provision in the collective agreement, in combination with the restrictions of the over\/under rule, will require the employment of more pilots at greater cost to ensure that all flights will be piloted in compliance with ICAO\u2019s over\/under rule.\n[43] Based on Captain Duke\u2019s testimony it is inconceivable that Air Canada and ACPA would, together, willingly embrace the inflexibility and cost of matching \u201cone pilot over age 60 with one pilot under age 60\u201d on the flight decks of Air Canada aircraft.\n[44] I am mindful of the case of F.H. v McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, and the clarification by the Supreme Court of Canada that with respect to the standard of proof in civil cases: nothing more, nothing less than a balance of probabilities.\n[45] Although Air Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement of pilots at age 60 is prima facie discriminatory, it is not a discriminatory practice if Air Canada establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the limitation is based on a bona fide occupational requirement. The test to be applied is that articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Meiorin case, a three step process.\n[46] Steps one and two require an assessment of the legitimacy of the (work) standard\u2019s general purpose and the employer\u2019s intention in adopting it. The assessment must be both objective and subjective to ensure that the standard does not have a discriminatory foundation.\n[47] It is clear from Duke\u2019s evidence that for decades Air Canada has engaged in a legitimate and meaningful bargaining process with the pilot\u2019s union that has resulted in an enduring collective agreement which enshrines seniority and provides for mandatory retirement at age 60 with a reasonable pension. In the result, Air Canada has been able to effectively balance the introduction of new pilots to replace a predictable number of retiring pilots. Assessing this situation both subjectively and objectively, I conclude on a balance of probabilities that the work standard does not have a discriminatory foundation.\n[48] The third step in Meiorin requires a determination whether the standard was established to accomplish a legitimate purpose. Again, persuaded by Captains Duke\u2019s evidence, I conclude on a balance of probabilities that the work standard of mandatory retirement in the collective bargaining agreement between Air Canada and ACPA was intended to accomplish the legitimate purpose of melding the company\u2019s needs with the collective rights and needs of its pilots.\n[49] The third step also requires Air Canada to prove that it would suffer undue hardship in accommodating the complainants. Given the restrictions of the ICAO over\/under rule, I am satisfied that the accommodation of the needs in the period after November 2006, by abolishing mandatory retirement, would result in negative consequences to Air Canada: significantly increased operational costs, inefficiency in the scheduling of pilots, and, to a lesser extent, negative ramifications for the pilot\u2019s pension plan, and the collective bargaining agreement, particularly in maintaining an effective rule of seniority. I conclude on a balance of probabilities that Air Canada would suffer undue hardship in accommodating the complainant\u2019s needs.\nV. Ruling [50] With respect to the question whether being under age 60 was a bona fide occupational requirement for Air Canada pilots after November 2006, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that:\n(1) Mandatory retirement of pilots at age 60 is based solely on a bona fide occupational requirement, therefore it is not a discriminatory practice, and\n(2) Accommodating the needs of the complainants after November 2006 would impose undue hardship on Air Canada, considering health, safety and cost.\nVI. Decision [51] The complainants George Vilven and Robert Kelly have not substantiated their allegation of a decimator practice on the part of Air Canada during the period after November 006. Accordingly their complaints are dismissed.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Final Conclusion. 77\nI. Introduction [1] This proceeding involves seventy complainants, sixty-eight of whom are represented by counsel (\u201cComplainants\u201d). They allege that Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) (\u201cRespondents\u201d) have discriminated against them by reason of their age by requiring them to retire from employment as pilots with Air Canada on reaching the age of 60, contrary to ss. 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). Their mandatory retirement dates vary and run from 2005 to 2009.\n[2] To succeed in their complaints, the Complainants must establish a prima facie case of discrimination and once having done so, the onus shifts to the Respondents to establish a defence on a balance of probabilities.\n[3] Under the terms of the collective agreement and pension plan between Air Canada and ACPA, Air Canada pilots are required to retire on the first day of the month following their 60th birthday. Amended Schedule A, Complainants Employment History (January 4, 2010) provided by Air Canada, lists each complainant\u2019s name; date of birth; date of 60th birthday; and date of retirement. This shows that all of the complainants were retired on the prescribed date. Their employment was terminated solely because of their age. This is not disputed by the Respondents. Accordingly, the Complainants have established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[4] The Respondents have offered two defences to the allegation of discrimination. First, under s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA and secondly, under s. 15(1)(a) and15(2) of the CHRA.\nA. Normal Age of Retirement, section 15(1)(c) CHRA [5] In its April 9, 2009 decision in Vilven & Kelly v. Air Canada & ACPA, the Federal Court rejected the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion in Vilven that the appropriate comparator group for the purposes of s.15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act were pilots who flew regularly scheduled, international flights on wide-bodied aircraft to international destinations with a major international airline.\n[6] The Court stated that s. 15(1)(c) requires two questions to be answered. First, \u201cwhat is the proper comparator group to identify the positions that are similar to that occupied by Air Canada and secondly, what is the normal age of retirement\u201d.\n[7] And when assessing whether a position is \u201csimilar\u201d to that occupied by the complainants, the focus should be on the objective duties and functional responsibilities of the position in question. That is, what do Air Canada pilots actually do?\n[8] For the Federal Court, \u201cthe essence of what Air Canada pilots do is to fly aircraft of varying sizes and types, transporting passengers to both domestic and international destinations, through Canadian and international airspace\u201d, (para. 111).\n[9] Thus the appropriate comparator group for the complainants should be \u201cpilots working for Canadian airlines who fly aircraft of varying sizes and types to both domestic and international destinations, through Canadian and international airspace\u201d, (para.112) (\u201cTest\u201d).\n[10] The Court reiterated the Test later in paragraph 125 of its decision where it said, \u201cTo summarize my findings to this point: the essence of what Air Canada pilots do can be described as flying aircraft of varying sizes and types, transporting passengers to both domestic and international destinations, through Canadian and foreign airspace. There are many Canadian pilots in similar positions, including those working for other Canadian airlines. These pilots form the comparator group for the purposes of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\u201d\n[11] The Court observed that, as of the date of the Agreed Statement of Facts that the parties submitted to the Vilven Tribunal, there were five airlines in Canada, apart from Air Canada, that transported passengers to domestic and international destinations. They were Jazz, Air Transat, CanJet, Skyservice and WestJet. However, there is nothing in this observation that suggests that the Court accepted that these five airlines satisfied all of the comparator criteria set out in paragraphs 112 and 125.\n[12] Interestingly, the Court went on to say in paragraph 170 of its decision that, \u201cas explained earlier, the Tribunal erred in its identification of \u2018positions similar\u2019\u201d. It is \u201cpilots working for Canadian airlines flying aircraft of various sizes to domestic and international destinations, through Canadian foreign airspace that form the proper comparator group\u201d. The words, \u201ctransporting passengers\u201d and \u201cboth\u201d in reference to destinations and \u201ctypes\u201d in reference to aircraft are absent in this formulation of the test for the comparator group.\n[13] As to the second question of \u201cwhat is the normal age of retirement,\u201d the Court found that a binding rule in place mandating retirement at a fixed age is not required for the purposes of s. 15(1)(c). The CHRA does not contemplate that the defence under s. 15(1)(c) is only available if there is a binding rule in a given industry mandating retirement at a particular age. Rather, the age of retirement in issue must be the normal, customary or standard within the relevant industry sector. As was the case in McAllister v. Maritime Employers Association, (1999) 36 C.H.R.R. D\/446 (F.C.T.D.) where the Court held that there is a significant difference between the normal age of retirement and the mandatory age of retirement.\n[14] The Court agreed with the Vilven Tribunal that the determination of the normal age of retirement requires a statistical analysis of the total number count of similar positions. This involves a factual determination of the age at which a majority of employees working in similar positions retire, whether required to or normally do so.\n[15] In Campbell v. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602, age 60 was found to be the normal age of retirement where approximately 81% of Canadian flight attendants were required to retire at that age according to the terms of their collective agreement. In Canadian National Railway v. Prior (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D\/268, where 60% of the employees were subject to mandatory retirement at age 65, this age was found to be the normal age of retirement.\n[16] In its decision in Vilven, the Court referred to the statistical evidence before the Tribunal with respect to airline pilots working for both Air Canada and other comparator Canadian airlines. This evidence showed that 56.13% of Canadian airline pilots retired by the time they attained age 60. The Court considered this to be the normal age of retirement for the purposes of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA. (This was also the result reached by the Vilven Tribunal but using a different test to determine the comparator group).\n[17] The Complainants challenge the use of a statistical analysis arguing that the Tribunal is required to read s. 15(1)(c) in its entire context, in its grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the CHRA and the intent of Parliament, which may or may not be consistent with other judicial decisions relating to this provision. In support of this position, the Complainants rely on various sources including, principles of statutory interpretation; regulations under the CHRA; Parliamentary proceedings; Directive from the Supreme Court of Canada and other judicial authorities.\n[18] These sources do not contemplate a statistical analysis to determine the normal age of retirement. The Complainants go further and suggest that, relying on this contextual approach, it may not be possible to determine the normal age of retirement. Thus, they argue that the statutory defence under s. 15(1)(c) would not be available to the Respondents.\n[19] Although a very intriguing argument, I do not see how I can ignore other judicial decisions as urged by the Complainants including those of the Federal Court. These decisions deal with the same issues as here and are binding on this Tribunal.\nB. What Should be the Test for the Comparator Group? [20] For the comparator group, the Respondents accept and rely on the Court\u2019s formula in paragraphs 112 and 125. The Complainants have a different opinion. Both the Complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) assert that the formula prescribed by the Court in these two paragraphs of its decision should not be literally applied in determining the appropriate comparators. Rather, the test that the Court set out in Vilven was dictated by the facts in that case and should only be considered as guidelines to assist the Tribunal in defining the comparator group.\n[21] Both the Complainants and the CHRC point to paragraph 170 of the Vilven decision position as support and propose that the Test should be \u201cpilots working for Canadian airlines flying aircraft to either domestic or international destinations through Canadian or foreign airspace\u201d. They say that the Court inserted \u201cboth\u201d in relation to domestic and international destinations in the Test to emphasize that the Tribunal erred in limiting the comparator group to those airlines that fly only to international destinations. The Court did not intend that the definition of the comparator group to be more restrictive than that of the Tribunal. It should be read disjunctively to include an airline whether it operates only domestically or only internationally.\n[22] Further, both the Complainants and the CHRC assert that the absence of \u201cvarying types\u201d in paragraph 170 makes sense. Otherwise, two of Air Canada\u2019s major competitors, who fly only one type of aircraft would be excluded from the comparator group.\n[23] This is so even though their pilots do essentially do what Air Canada pilots do, fly passengers to domestic and international destinations. The CHRC would also drop Varying Sizes from the Test arguing that size does not matter. Whether an aircraft is small, medium or large, the essence of what a pilot does is the same.\n[24] It is unfortunate that the Court went on to state the comparator test for yet a third time and somewhat differently as it did in paragraph 170 of its decision. There is no explanation from the Court, at this late stage of its decision, as to why the comparator test should be modified. In my view, it should be regarded more as a matter of inadvertence rather than a restatement of the comparator group test.\n[25] What the Tribunal must do in this case is what the Court did in Vilven, which is to ask and answer the question, what is the essence of what Air Canada pilots do? The evidence in this case demonstrates that what Air Canada pilots do is as described by the Court in Vilven in paragraphs 112 and 125. Thus, the criteria to be applied in this case will be the same as the criteria applied in Vilven to determine the appropriate group.\n(i) The Respondents\u2019 Comparator Group [26] The Respondents have the burden of answering the prima facie case of discrimination established by the Complainants. To do so, the Respondents have put forward in evidence two tables, \u201cTable of Canadian Airlines, Criteria of Comparator Group-2005 to 2008\u201d, (\u201cR-Table 1\u201d) prepared by Captain Steven Duke, Six Sigma Black Belt, Flight Operations. The second table, \u201cRevised Table of Canadian Airlines, Criteria of Comparator Group as of October 2009\u201d, (\u201cR\u2011Table 2\u201d) was prepared by Harlan Clark, Director, Labour Relations for Air Canada.\n[27] Both of the Respondents\u2019 Tables deal with the activities of the same airlines that were referenced by the Complainants, Captain Duke for the years 2005-2008 and Mr. Clark for 2009. Both Tables include 37 Canadian airlines for consideration. Both Tables indicate either \u201cyes\u2019 or \u201cno\u201d under each of the five Test criteria. Where there is \u201cyes\u201d for all of the criteria, the airline was included in the comparator group.\n[28] For Varying Size, both Captain Duke and Mr. Clark relied on the definition provided by the Canadian Transportation Agency (\u201cCTA\u201d) in its Application Guide for Canadian Applicants for a Licence to operate a Domestic or Non-scheduled International Service. They chose the CTA definition rather than Transport Canada (\u201cTC\u201d) 703\/704\/705 definition because it refers to the number of seats and if considering airlines that transport passengers, the number of seats was a common denominator for all the airlines.\n[29] The CTA classifies aircraft on the basis of the Certificated Maximum Carrying Capacity (\u201cCMCC\u201d). A \u201clarge aircraft\u201d means an aircraft equipped for the carriage of passengers and having a CMCC of more than 89 passengers. A \u201cmedium aircraft\u201d means an aircraft equipped for the carriage of passengers and having a CMCC of more than 39 but not more than 89 passengers. A \u201csmall aircraft\u201d means an aircraft equipped for the carriage of passengers and having a CMCC of not more than 39 passengers.\n[30] Captain Duke and Mr. Clark defined Domestic to mean from one point in Canada to another point in Canada, scheduled or non-scheduled and whether or not it overflies the U.S. enroute. They considered an International as a flight between two city pairs, one in Canada and one outside of Canada.\n[31] Both The Canadian Transportation Act (s.55) and the CTA Application Guide: For Canadian applicants for a licence to operate a domestic or non-scheduled international air service, define \u201cdomestic service\u201d as air service between points in Canada, from and to the same point in Canada or between Canada and a point outside Canada that is not in the territory of another country; and \u201cInternational service\u201d as an air service between Canada and a point in the territory of another country. The CTA Air Carrier Licence Search (\u201cACLS\u201d) for type of licence shows Domestic as Service within Canada.\n[32] For Varying Types, Mr. Clark referred to the TC OLS website that outlined the various types of aircraft for a particular airline and used that as a guideline for determining airline types. Captain Duke relied on what the airline representatives told him about the types of aircraft they operated.\n(ii) The Complainants\u2019 Comparator Group a. Evidence of Captain Paul Prentice [33] Captain Prentice is a complainant in this matter. He was employed as a first officer with Air Canada. He retired on October 1, 2005, the first day of the month following his 60th birthday. At one point in his career at Air Canada from about 1997 to 2001, he was the manager of flight operations and flight safety. He returned to line flying because he was due to retire about 18 months later and wanted to go back to flying aircraft.\n[34] Captain Prentice prepared three Tables. His first Table (\u201cC-Table 1\u201d) entitled \u201cRetirement Ages of Pilots working for Canadian Air Carriers\u201d December 31st 2005 combines each airline\u2019s activities, their pilot totals and their retirement age and policy. It includes the following headings: Air Carrier; Pilots; Retirement Age; Retirement Policy; International Flights; Passenger; Freight; Part 705; Data provided by; and Contact Info. There are no categories for Domestic Flights or Varying Sizes and Types.\n[35] The genesis of C-Table 1 is found in Captain Prentice\u2019s Statement of Facts, February 6, 2006, that he submitted to the CHRC in support of his human rights complaint. He reviewed what he considered to be the relevant jurisprudence on s. 15(1)(c) and compiled a list of Canadian airlines from the TC website that he considered comparable to Air Canada. These airlines are designated as part 705 air carriers under the Canadian Aviation Regulations (\u201cCARs\u201d) and hold the same Air Operating Certificate (\u201cAOC\u201d) as Air Canada.\n[36] He came up with the list of nine airlines which had a total of 3,090 pilots compared to 3,066 for Air Canada. He obtained this information by contacting key personnel whom he knew at these airlines who had access to seniority lists which showed the number of pilots employed in similar positions to Air Canada pilots. From these sources, he also obtained confirmation that their pilots were not required to retire at age 60.\n[37] Once he determined that Air Canada was in the statistical minority, he did no further investigation and submitted this information to the CHRC.\n[38] For the purpose of this hearing, Captain Prentice continued his information gathering. In obtaining the information for C-Table 1, Captain Prentice said that it was a group effort, a group of five pilots including him. In some cases he was given the information by others in the group and in some cases he researched the website. Where he indicated on C-Table 1 that the data was provided online, he would determine if the airline had a website. If so, either he or one of the group would contact the airline.\n[39] As to the phone numbers of the airlines listed on this Table, Captain Prentice said he would have called a fair portion of those but was not certain which airlines other people called.\n[40] As to the Pilot totals for each airline, he had the Air Canada, January 1, 2006 pilot seniority lists and the Jazz pilot position lists for 2005. He also referred to Schedules A and B of the Vilven Agreed Facts which has pilot numbers for Air Canada, Jazz, Air Transat, CanJet, Skyservice and Westjet. For the other airlines listed on C-Table 1, he or other members of the group obtained this information from someone who had worked or worked at the airline.\n[41] Captain Prentice believed that the pilot numbers that he acquired would be more accurate at year-end because seniority lists were the most stable for the latter part of the year. So he chose December 31, 2005 as a snapshot. To acquire data month by month or year by year was an acquisition nightmare. Pilot seniority lists go up and down and it was beyond his ability to get information by month or year. If the numbers for pilots were close to that data he had acquired, he used the Vilven data.\n[42] For \u201cRetirement Age\u201d on C-Table 1, Captain Prentice said that he used data from the Vilven Agreed Facts. The Table shows that all of the airlines he listed have a retirement age of 65. Only Air Canada has a retirement age of 60. For \u201cRetirement Policy\u201d on C-Table 1, some of the data comes from the Vilven Agreed Facts and for the rest of the listed airlines it may have come from calling the references listed.\n[43] As to the Air Carriers that he listed as comparators, C-Table 1 shows thirty-four, Part 705 airlines and two, Part 704 airlines (Air Alliance\/Georgian and Air Inuit). The TC website, Part VII, CARs, defines a Part 705 AOC and a Part 704 AOC.\n[44] A Part 705 certificate, Airline Operations, is issued to an air operator that operates an aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight (\u201cMCTOW\u201d) in excess of 19,000 lbs and for which a Canadian type certificate has been issued for the transport of 20 or more passengers.\n[45] A Part 704 certificate, Commuter Operations, issues for an airline that operates aircraft having a MCTOW of 19,000 lbs or less and a seating configuration excluding pilot seats of 10 to 19 inclusive.\n[46] A Part 703 certificate, Air taxi Operations, is issued for aircraft having a MCTOW of 19,000 lbs or less and a seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of nine or less.\n[47] Captain Prentice searched the TC website, Operator List Search (\u201cOLS\u201d) in October 2009 for Part 705 airlines that produced a total of thirty-seven airlines. He also searched the TC, OLS website for Part 704 airlines that showed eighty-seven airlines.\n[48] Although Captain Prentice did not include Part 704 airlines in C-Table 1 (except for Air Alliance and Air Inuit) the Complainants say that these airlines arguably meet the comparator Test. They want the Tribunal to take them into account as backup comparators if there is problem in terms of numbers to support their position.\n[49] Captain Prentice said that he did not contact any of these Part 704 airlines nor did the Complainants offer any analysis beyond the information on the TC website to show that any of them fall within the comparator group. There was no evidence on the number of pilot positions for these Part 704 airlines other than Captain Prentice\u2019s estimate, based on his experience in the industry, that you need at least 1,500 pilots to keep these airlines in business.\n[50] With respect to \u201cInternational Flights\u201d, Captain Prentice said that he consulted the airline\u2019s website to see if it had a charter operation. If it was not apparent from the website, either he or one of the other pilots who were assisting him contacted the airline. Captain Prentice included airlines as comparators if they actually did fly internationally, scheduled or charter or whether they were licenced, or were willing and able to do so.\n[51] For those airlines that he called, he asked if he wanted to charter an aircraft to the US could they do that. This was in 2009. He did not ask them about 2005. He could not vouch for what questions the other group members asked. So all the data under \u201cInternational\u201d on C\u2011Table 1 is 2009 data.\n[52] Captain Prentice did not include on C-Table 1 any category for Varying Types or Varying Sizes of aircraft and did not provide any explanation as to why these criteria were not considered.\n[53] The conclusion that Captain Prentice reached from C-Table 1 is that the number of pilots employed by the comparator airlines as of December 31, 2005 total 5,350, compared to the total number for Air Canada pilots of 3,037. In terms of percentage, the total for the comparator pilots constitutes 63.8% of the total number of pilots.\n(iii) Conclusion on C-Table 1 and the Normal Age of Retirement [54] In my opinion, there are problems if the Complainants are relying on Captain Prentice\u2019s C-Table 1 to establish the normal age of retirement for the purposes of s.15(1)(c). As he explained, C-Table 1 is a snapshot of the situation at December 31, 2005. But some of the pilot numbers are taken from the Vilven Agreed Facts which are from 2006. Other pilot numbers were obtained either by Captain Prentice or by his colleagues contacting the airlines in 2009. Data for International is as of 2009. So C-Table 1 is a hybrid of 2005, 2006 and 2009 data but purports to represent the situation as it was in December 2005.\n[55] Last but certainly not least, Captain Prentice has constructed his own formula as to what criteria should be used to determine the comparator group. He includes only two of the five criteria enunciated by the Court. I have decided that all five should be used to determine the comparator. Even if paragraph 170 of the Court\u2019s decision governs, his factors don\u2019t match. It may be arguable to wander away somewhat from the Court\u2019s formulation. But there must be some justification for doing so. Here there is none unless it is rooted in his initial submission to the CHRC. That may be an explanation but it is not a justification.\n[56] For these reasons, I cannot accept his C-Table 1 as the basis for establishing the normal age of retirement.\n[57] Captain Prentice prepared a second table, \u201cTable of Canadian Airlines, Criteria of Comparator Groups, 2005 to 2009\u201d. The Complainants submitted this as reply evidence. It responds to both Captain Duke\u2019s R-Table 1 and Mr. Clark\u2019s R-Table 2. What Captain Prentice did was highlite, airline by airline, under each of the five criteria, where his conclusion differed from that of Mr. Clark and Captain Duke.\n[58] In constructing C-Table 2, Captain Prentice used different definitions than Captain Duke and Mr. Clark for the Test. The differences related mainly to Domestic, International and Varying Size. As to Type if an aircraft was a different model as shown on the OLS or company website, Captain Prentice would consider it is a different type.\n[59] For Varying Size he did not use the CTA definitions of small, medium and large as determined by the maximum passenger carrying capacity. Instead he relied on the TC OLS maximum weight.\n[60] In particular, if there was a weight difference of more than 500 lbs, Captain Prentice would classify them as being of a different size. Captain Prentice said that his cut off point is not based on any official document but rather on logic. He gave the example of a BE100 at 11,500 lbs and a BE99 at 11,000 lbs. They would be different types but not different sizes. A BE100 at 11,500 lbs and a DHC8 at 34,500 lbs, they would be different types and different sizes.\n[61] On the question of International Flights, Captain Prentice relied on the ACLS to determine whether an airline is licenced to fly internationally. He also relied on the company website and on email information from airline representatives. If he could not obtain further information from the website or by contacting the airline, he would rely solely on the ACLS.\n[62] The criterion he used for International was whether it was licenced and operated international charters or whether the airline was licenced to operate internationally and was capable and willing to quote on and provide an international charter flight.\n(iv) Combined Comparator Group Tables [63] I have combined R-Table 1, R-Table 2 and C-Table 2 into one Table which shows only those airlines where the parties disagree as to whether or not the Test is met and the reasons therefor.\n[64] Duke: Air Transat: Issue: Domestic: No Size: No Data Source: Testimony of Anne Bujold, Human Resources Advisor. She testified that Air Transit is a charter vacation airline that operated scheduled flights to 60 destinations in Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, US and South America and did so in 2005-2009. She also testified that Air Transat did not fly any domestic flights during 2005-2009. The airline had two types of aircraft A310 and A330 in 2005-2009. These are both large.\n[65] Clark: Air Transat for 2009: same as above. Further, Mr. Clark tried to book a flight on Air Transat from Montreal to Toronto; from Montreal to Vancouver; and from Toronto to Vancouver and was unable to do so. His explanation was that Air Transat does not provide service between one Canadian city and another.\n[66] Prentice: Air Transat: Issue: Domestic: Yes Size: Yes Data Source: CTA website, Air Carrier Licence Search (\u201cACLS\u201d 2009). This shows that Air Transat holds a Domestic licence to fly domestically. He also produced Schedule Notice Change from Nolitours dated November 2009, showing an Air Transat flight from Puerto Vallarta to Toronto and a letter from Janet Brock, owner of Travel Plus (2009), that says that Air Transat frequently connect domestic cities in Canada to fly their passengers to international destinations. Captain Prentice relied on this to show that Air Transat flies to domestic destinations. The TC Canadian Civil Aircraft Register (2010) (\u201cCCAR\u201d) for Air Transat shows that it operates the A310-300, A330-243 and A330-342.\n[67] Duke: SkyService: Issue: Domestic: No Size: No Data Source: Director, Planning and Scheduling. SkyService stopped flying passenger domestic flights in 2005. During the years from 2005-2008, Skyservice flew three sizes of aircraft, B757, A320 and A330. Under the CTA definition, these are all large aircraft.\n[68] Clark: Skyservice for 2009: same as above except for Data Source: Testimony of Phillip Goss. Mr. Goss is a Human Resources Specialist with Skyservice. Skyservice was a charter operation that would be contracted by tour operators who would provide the aircraft and Skyservice would provide the pilots and flight attendants to operate the aircraft. Currently Skyservice does not fly to any domestic destinations. When he joined Skyservice in 2007, it operated exclusively international but is licensed to fly both international and domestic. In 2009, Skyservice had 16 aircraft provided to it and one of its own. They were comprised of eight A320\u2019s and eight 757\u2019s, two aircraft types but all large aircraft.\n[69] Prentice: Skyservice: Issue: Domestic: Yes Size: Yes Data Source: Wikipedia which shows the types of aircraft Sky service flies, B767-300, A319-100 and A330-340. CCAR (2010) which shows aircraft types for Skyservice Business Aviation 1. Printouts from Sabre Airline Solutions (2007). These are pairing print reports for Captain Robert Kelly showing Skyservice Flight 393, YYC-YVR and Flight 394, YVR-YYC on 12FEB07 and 13FEB0, Calgary\u2013Vancouver return. There are other pairings shown for YWG-YVR, YVR-YYZ (23Dec06); YWG-YQR (Regina) YQR-YYZ (December 2005).\n[70] Duke: WestJet: Issue: Size: No Type: No Data Source: Exec. Vice-Pres., Operations, who advised that in 2005 WestJet flew two sizes of aircraft, B737A and B737C, both large aircraft. As to types, WestJet stopped flying the B737A in 2005 so that from 2006-2008 it only flew one type of aircraft, B737C. They continue to fly only the B737C.\n[71] Clark: Westjet for 2009: same as above except for Data Source: Testimony of Fazel Manji. Mr. Manji is a Compensation Analyst for Westjet. Westjet transports passengers to 66 destinations including Canada, US, and to sun destinations. In 2009, it operated the B737-600-700-800 series which is a large aircraft as per the CTA definition. The B737 is one type of aircraft.\n[72] Prentice: Westjet: Issue: Size: Yes Type: Yes Data Source: TC CCAR (2010). This shows that Westjet flies the B737-600-700-800 series. It retired the B-737-200 in 2006. Captain Prentice relied on this for different sizes and different types from 1996-2006.\n[73] Duke: Air Georgian: Issue: Size: No Data Source: Payroll and HR Manager who he spoke to and who also advised him by email that Air Georgian\u2019s fleet consisted a number of different types of aircraft for those years but they were all small as per the CTA definition.\n[74] Clark: Air Georgian for 2009: Issue: Size: No Type: No Data Source: Testimony of Marjorie Vivanco. Air Georgian does not meet the Test because it does not fly varying sizes or types of aircraft. According to Ms. Vivanco, as of 2009, it only operated the BE1900 aircraft, a small aircraft. It stopped flying the BE300-350 BE90 and Cessna 550 in 2007.\n[75] Prentice: Air Georgian: Issue: Size: Yes Type: Yes Data Source: TC OLS (2010); shows aircraft types, BE90 9,300 lbs, 703; BE300, 14,000 lbs, 703; BE1900, 17,000 lbs, 704; and Cessna550 13,300 lbs, 704. CCAR (2010) shows types of aircraft as the BE and a BAE25.\n[76] Duke: Bearskin Airline: Issue: Size: No Type: No Data Source: Chief Pilot. In 2005- 2008 Bearskin only operated small aircraft and only one type of aircraft. Captain Duke also relied on his personal knowledge as a pilot with Bearskin for five years.\n[77] Clark: Bearskin Airline for 2009: Issue: International: ? Size: No Type: No Data Source: Exhibit R-14, Tab 7. Mr. Clark referenced the Company\u2019s website for his conclusion of No under the above three issues. He did not however, refer to that part of the website that indicates that Bearskin conducts private charters throughout North America. He would not agree that the No should be changed to Yes, but would agree to a question mark be placed in the International column on R-Table 2.\n[78] Prentice: Bearskin Airline: Issue: International: Yes Size: Yes Type: Yes Data Source: OLS (2009) which indicates that Bearskin operates BE99-100, 11,000 lbs and SW-4-5-17,000 lbs, all TC 704 aircraft. Email request from Dr. Kelly to Bearskin Airlines (2009). This document is an email which incorporates data taken by Dr. Kelly from CTA ACLS website and answers from James Reszitnyk Bearskin Flight\/Charter Coordinator to questions asked by Dr. Kelly. It shows that Bearskin is licenced for scheduled and non-scheduled international service. It also shows that Bearskin has flown international charters between 2005-2009, the last such charter being in August 2009 and could and would be able to provide an international charter anytime between 2005-2009.\n[79] Duke: CanJet: Issue: Domestic: No Size No. Data Source: Chief Pilot. CanJet ceased flying domestic operations in 2006 and in 2007-2008 operated only between Canada and sun destinations. In 2005, CanJet had a mixed fleet with two different types B737 A and B. In 2006, they stopped flying the B737A and the B737B in 2007. From 2008 it operated exclusively a B737 C fleet.\n[80] Clark: CanJet for 2009: Issue: Domestic: No Size: No Type: No Data Source: Testimony of Kim Maguiness. Ms. Maguiness is the Director of Human Resources with CanJet. Her evidence was that until September 2006, CanJet operated to cities in Canada as a discount passenger airline. In September 2006, it ceased domestic flights and continued to operate as a charter airline. Between 2005-2006, its fleet consisted of Boeing 737-300-500 aircraft. In 2009, it operated the B737-800.\n[81] Prentice: CanJet: Issue: Domestic: Yes Size: Yes Type: Yes Data Source: CTA ACLS website (2009) indicates that CanJet is licenced for domestic flying and for scheduled and non-scheduled international service.

It is currently licenced for charters within North America and internationally. Its fleet from 2005-2009 was B737-200-300-500, 120 seats, 132 seats and 118 seats. Currently it operates the B737-800, 189 seats.\n[82] Duke: Kelowna Flightcraft: Issue: Passenger: No Data Source: Chief Pilot. Kelowna qualified as a comparator for the years 2005-2006, but not for the years 2007-2008. According to the Chief Pilot, in 2007-2008, they were exclusively a freight\/cargo operation.\n[83] Clark: Kelowna Flightcraft for 2009: Issue: International: No Passenger: No Data Source: Exhibit R-14 Tab 9. Company website (2009), Kelowna was a freight operation only in 2009, serviced all major cities across Canada and was available for freight service to any location in North America or internationally.\n[84] Prentice: Kelowna Flightcraft: Issue: International: Yes Passenger: Yes Data Source: CTA ACLS (2009) shows that Kelowna is licenced for non-scheduled international service.

However, the Respondents subsequently included these two airlines as comparators for 2005-2007 for Harmony and 2005-2008 for Zoom. Harmony did not operate after 2007 and Zoom not after 2008.\n(v) Which Airlines Should be Included in the Comparator group? [158] The exercise to be done now is to choose from the Combined Comparator Tables which of the airlines listed there should be included in the comparator group as meeting the Test. But before this can be done, there are two preliminary questions that need to be dealt with.\n[159] First, how are Domestic, International and Varying Sizes to be defined. I have concluded on the evidence that Domestic mean between points in Canada or from and to the same points in Canada. It is interesting that the Complainants, in their BFOR argument take the position that the \u201cover\/under rule\u201d does not apply to Air Canada \u201cdomestic\u201d flights. They say that a flight that transits foreign airspace is domestic so long as it takes off and lands in Canada. I appreciate that the Test speaks in terms of Canadian Destinations. But I do not accept the characterization put forward by the Complainants that a flight by a Canadian airline from New York to Toronto satisfies the Domestic criterion of the Test.\n[160] Nor does a Canadian airline that operates a charter flight directly from a Canadian city or picks up passengers in another Canadian city enroute to an international destination meet the Domestic test.\n[161] On the question as to whether an airline flies to International destinations, the Test refers to pilots working for Canadian airlines flying to international destinations. I accept Captain Prentice\u2019s approach to International. In my opinion, if an airline has operated international flights or is licenced to do so and will provide quotes and arrange for an international charter on request, that is sufficient to satisfy the international criterion.\n[162] For Varying Size, the Respondents relied on the CTA classification of small, medium or large, according to the seating capacity of the aircraft. The Complainants relied on the maximum weight of the aircraft. In this respect, a 500 lb weight difference is the measure used by Captain Prentice to differentiate between aircraft sizes. He did not explain as to why he chose this as the cutoff point.\n[163] The Application Guide for a CTA operating licence for domestic air service or international air service provides that the operator must hold an Air Operator Certificate (\u201cAOC\u201d) in respect of the class of service to be provided under the licence. The class of service is defined in terms of the size of the aircraft, namely, small, medium and large.\n[164] Part VII, 704 and 705 of the CARs (which the Complainants rely upon) classify aircraft both by its MCTOW and by its seating configuration. As indicated earlier in this decision, a Part 705 certificate has a specified MCTOW and an authorized seating configuration for transporting 20 or more passengers; a Part 704 certificate has a specified MCTOW and seating configuration of 10-19 seats inclusive. A Part 703 certificate has specified MCTOW and seating configuration of nine seats or less.\n[165] Also instructive is Article 1.01.06 of the Air Canada\/ACPA collective agreement which classifies aircraft size by seating capacity for the purpose of restricting the size of aircraft that can be flown by feeder airlines.\n[166] These references indicate that for various purposes in the airline industry, the seating capacity or configuration of an aircraft is more the common measure than aircraft weight. In my opinion, this should be the basis to determine Varying Size.\n[167] The second question is for what are the relevant years for determining the comparators and the normal age of retirement. The Respondents have provided data for 2005-2009. The Complainants\u2019 C-Table 2 on its face indicates that it covers the years 2005-2009.\n[168] But that is not the case. Captain Prentice testified that he included 36 of the 39 Canadian airlines listed on this Table in the comparator group. He did so for each of the airlines, if at any point in time during 2005-2009, these airlines met the Test. He agreed that this does not mean that the Test was met for each of those years.\n[169] It is apparent from the Combined Comparator Group Tables that in constructing C\u2011Table 2, Captain Prentice relied (with a few exceptions being 2010 data) on 2009 data sources. Thus, C-Table 2 is really a representation of the facts as they were in 2009.\n[170] But in doing the statistical analysis for pilot numbers and retirement age in the Complainants\u2019 \u201cTable of Comparator Pilot Employment Statistics for January 1, 2006, Based on Replies: December 21, 2009\u201d (\u201cC-Table 3\u201d), Captain Prentice used data only for 2006.\n[171] Thus, from the Complainants\u2019 side, the data for the comparators is on a global basis and the data for the pilot numbers and retirement age is for 2006. The parties have provided data on pilot numbers and retirement age for the whole period, 2005-2009.\n(vi) Conclusion on Comparable Airlines 2005-2008\n[172] In my view, the C-Table 2 conclusions and supporting evidence, based as it is on 2009 data, cannot be used for the years 2005-2008. Only evidence that reflects the facts for those years can be considered and that evidence came from Captain Duke.\n[173] That being the case, I have concluded that, on the basis of Captain Duke\u2019s evidence as set out in the Combined Table of Comparators and on my definitions of Domestic, International and Size, the following airlines qualify as comparators for 2005-2008:\n[173]Jazz - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 First Air - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Kelowna Flightcraft - Meets the Test for 2005, 2006.\n\u27a2 Voyageur - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Air Inuit - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Canadian North - Meets the Test for 2007, 2008.\n\u27a2 Air North Charter - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Air Tindi - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Nolinor - Meets the Test for 2008.\n\u27a2 Westwind - Meets the Test for all years.\n\u27a2 Harmony - Meets the Test for 2005-2007.\n\u27a2 Zoom - Meets the Test for 2005-2008.\n2009\n[174] For the year 2009, referring to the evidence of Captain Prentice and of Mr. Clark as set out in the Combined Table of Comparables, I have listed those airlines that qualify as comparables and those that don\u2019t and the reasons therefor.\n\u27a2 Jazz \u2013 Yes.

To determine the pilot totals for each of the years 2005-2009, I relied on the \u201cSurvey-Retirement Age of Pilots\u201d provided to the parties by the airlines.\n[176] In 2005 Air Canada employed 3,037 pilots all of whom were subject to mandatory retirement at age 60. The total number of pilots of the pilots working for the comparator airlines in 2005 was 1,876. The total number of pilots working for Canadian airlines in 2005 was 4,913. Statistically, Air Canada pilots represented 61.8% of all Canadian airline pilots in similar positions to that of the Complainants.\n[177] For the year 2006 the total number of pilots at Air Canada was 3,182. For the comparator airlines, the total number of pilots was 1,853 for a total of 5,035 pilots. This constituted 63% of all Canadian airline pilots in similar positions.\n[178] In 2007 there were 3,308 pilots at Air Canada. The comparator airlines pilots total was 2,120. The total for all Canadian airline pilots was 5,428 and Air Canada represented 61.4% of the total.\n[179] In 2008, Air Canada had a total of 3,327 pilots. The total of the comparator pilots was 2,175 for a total of 5,502 for all pilots, Air Canada being 60.5% of the total number pilots.\n[180] For 2009 the total number of pilots at Air Canada was 3,204. The total number of pilots employed by the comparator airlines in 2009 was 1,982. The total number of pilots employed by Air Canada and the comparator airlines in 2009 was 5,186 of which 61.85% were Air Canada pilots.\n[181] Assuming without deciding, that for the years 2005-2009, the comparator airlines had either had a mandatory retirement age of 65 or above or no mandatory retirement age, nonetheless, the evidence demonstrates that, for each of the years 2005-2009, the majority of pilots working for Canadian airlines, including Air Canada, in similar positions to that of the Complainants, retire by the age 60. The conclusion must be that age 60 was the normal age of retirement for the years 2005-2009.\n[182] Given this conclusion, the mandatory retirement imposed on the Complainants at age 60 pursuant to the collective agreement between the Respondents by virtue of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA does not constitute a discriminatory practice.\nC. Sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) CHRA (i) Rodney Stone [183] He is the Manager of Operations and Air Traffic Control at Air Canada. He is a certified flight dispatcher. There are 70 flight dispatchers at Air Canada whose main duties and the responsibilities are to develop an operational flight plan for each Air Canada flight. An aircraft cannot move without an operations flight plan which is filed with the air traffic agency as an International Commercial Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d) flight plan.\n[184] The flight plan will include such information as flight route weight points, fuel calculation, electronic notation etc. The flight plan is built about three-four hours before departure. There are several methods to determine routings, the majority of which are based on en route winds. Also considered are overfly costs. For an overseas flight, they may run 30-40 different scenarios to choose the one that is appropriate for that particular flight on that day.\n[185] Air Canada submitted a list of 34 destination countries all of which require overflights or planned alternative airports, whether destination alternates or en route alternates. Overflights means an Air Canada flight utilizing the air space of other countries to get to its destination. Mr. Stone said that there are no destinations to which Air Canada flies that do not involve the US as an overflight or alternate. Further he said, even for destinations in Canada there are occasions when Air Canada will overfly US airspace.\n[186] Once the flight plan is finalized it is released into the operations computer and is given to the flight crew. It is also filed with the appropriate Air Traffic Agency. ATC usually gives a pre-departure clearance which generally echoes the flight plan filed with the ATC. There are many ATC agencies who view the flight plan as a contract between the ATC and Air Canada so that minimal changes will be accepted.\n[187] ATC will accept minor changes to a routing. There are occasions where the aircraft will request from ATC routings around en route weather. Military airspace is another situation where ATC will vary the flight plan. Apart from an emergency, Mr. Stone could not think of any other situations where the captain could obtain an alternate routing from the ATC.\n(ii) Samuel Elfassy [188] Mr. Elfassy is currently the Senior Director of Corporate Safety and Environment for Air Canada and has worked at Air Canada for 22 years. In his previous role of Manager, Regulatory Affairs for flight operations he was involved with the application of the standards and recommendations of the ICAO as they applied to Air Canada\u2019s operations. He testified on behalf of the Respondents.\n[189] ICAO was established in 1948 under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation whose purpose was to harmonize the standards for international commercial aviation operations. Canada is a Contracting State and signatory to the Convention. There are about 190 Contracting States to the Convention and, according to the List of Air Canada Destinations, Air Canada operates to 34 of these States. According to Mr. Elfassy, of these, six of them, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Guadeloupe, Korea, St. Lucia and Turks & Caicos are not signatories to the Convention.\n[190] Mr. Elfassy referred to Annex 1 of the Convention which sets the standards for the international recognition of flight crew licences. Prior to November 23, 2006, s. 2.1.10.1 of Annex 1 provided that a Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, shall not permit the holders thereof to act as pilot-in-command (\u201cPIC\u201d) of an aircraft engaged in scheduled international air services or non-scheduled international air transport operations for remuneration or hire if the licence holders have attained their 60th birthday.\n[191] For co-pilots, it was only a recommendation not a standard. The recommendation under s. 2.1.10.2 provided that a Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, should not permit the holders thereof to act as co-pilot of an aircraft engaged in scheduled international air services or non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire if the licence holders have attained their 60th birthday.\n[192] On March 10, 2006, ICAO amended Annex 1, effective November 23, 2006. The amendment provides that a Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, shall not permit the holders thereof to act as pilot-in-command of an aircraft engaged in international commercial air transport operations if the licence holders have attained their 60th birthday or, in the case of operations with more than one pilot where the other pilot is younger than 60 years of age, their 65th birthday. The upper age limit for co-pilots also increased to 65, but otherwise the ICAO recommendation remained the same.\n[193] The practical effect is as follows. A PIC age 60 or over but less than 65, operating an aircraft with a crew of two pilots, cannot be prevented by reason of age from operating in the airspace of any ICAO Contracting State so long as the other pilot is under age 60 (the \u201cover\/under rule\u201d).\n[194] There is also the matter of augmented crews. According to ICAO, in commercial long range international air transport, the designated flight crew may be augmented and may consist of three, four or more pilots. It is the intent of s. 2.1.10.1 to ensure that when the PIC is over 60 but less than 65, the operating crew includes at least one pilot who is licenced, appropriately rated for all phases of flight, current and is under age 60.\n[195] Mr. Elfassy said that on long haul flights, Air Canada will augment the flight crew by putting additional flight crew members on those flights in order to comply with the collective agreement and the CARs. The CARs provide prescriptive rules for flight duty hours. But the Regulations allow flight crew members to extend the duty day provided that the flight crew is augmented with additional pilots.\n[196] The collective agreement requires a basic crew plus one augment pilot and one relief pilot or two augment pilots where the flight is outside the Northern American zone and exceeds fifteen hours.\n[197] A Contracting State may impose a lower maximum age limit than that specified in the ICAO standard for the licences it issues to its pilots. But it cannot prevent, by reason of age, an aircraft from another ICAO Contracting State operated by a PIC holding a licence issued by that State, who is below the ICAO upper age limit standard, from operating in that State.\n[198] Articles 39 and 40 of the Convention are also relevant. Article 39 requires that licences issued by a Contracting State that do not meet the ICAO standard must be endorsed with a complete enumeration of the particulars that do not satisfy the standard.\n[199] Article 40 allows international flights by flight crew having licences that do not meet the ICAO standard to operate in international navigation so long as authorization is given by the State into which the aircraft is operated. Canada does not impose any age limit in licencing its pilots and permits pilots who are 60 years or older, holding a medically valid ICAO Contracting State licence, to fly into Canadian airspace.\n[200] Mr. Elfassy said that he was not aware of any of the Contracting States into which Air Canada operates that have granted authorization for Air Canada pilots over the age of 60 pre-November 2006, or over the age of 65 post-November 2006 to operate in their airspace. This would be a matter of negotiation between the Contracting States, not something that Air Canada could request.\n[201] As to the potential consequences for an airline that breaches the ICAO standard, Mr. Elfassy referred to the memorandum from the Director General Aviation, France. In that document, the Director stated that in the course of audits done by their ramp inspectors, they were finding captains over the age of 60 and had to ground the aircraft which was only then allowed to leave with another captain. In future they would be taking appropriate measures to deal with such a situation. These measures could include delaying of a flight until appropriate documentation is provided or it could be grounding of a flight.\n[202] Mr. Elfassy testified that, in addition to the ICAO requirements, Air Canada is also subject to the provisions of 14 CFR Part 129, Foreign Operations Specifications, with respect to its operations into the U.S. He explained that under Part 129, the Federal Aviation Authority (\u201cFAA\u201d) had issued pre-November 2006 operations specifications, which provided that the foreign air carrier (Air Canada) shall not use the services of a PIC, nor shall any person act as a PIC if that person has reached his\/her 60th birthday.\n[203] The Operations Specifications (\u201cOPSPEC\u201d) for Air Canada were amended in December 2006 to provide that the foreign air carriers shall comply with the current age requirements of ICAO Annex 1 as amended and the foreign air carrier shall not use the services of a pilot, nor shall any person act as a pilot of a civil airplane of U.S. registry in any of the operations under the authority of these operations specifications, if that person has reached his\/her 60th birthday.\n[204] Mr. Elfassy explained that for Air Canada this means that the current ICAO standards apply to its operations into the U.S. The latter part of the OPSPEC is an example of a State imposing a more restrictive age requirement than the ICAO standard. At that time, the US had a maximum age limit of 60 for licencing its pilots.\n[205] However, effective December 13, 2007, under the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act, the U.S. now allows commercial pilots on domestic flights to fly up to the age of 65. For international flights, the US adopted the over\/under rule of the ICAO standard.\n[206] Mr. Elfassy\u2019s experience when he was the point of contact with the FAA, if the ICAO rules were not followed, was that the principle operations inspector FAA would contact him and tell him that one of their inspectors audited an Air Canada airplane and identified certain problems which Air Canada would rectify. If there were repeated contraventions of the OPSPEC there could be financial penalties or the OPSPEC could be revoked so that Air Canada could no longer operate into the U. S.\n[207] On the question of the application of the FAA regulations to Air Canada, Mr. Elfassy was referred to a December 11, 2006 letter from a Rebecca B. McPherson, the FAA Assistant Chief Counsel, Regulations Division. This letter was in response to a request by George Vilven, a retired Air Canada First Officer, for a legal interpretation of the \u201cAge 60 Rule\u201d, specifically whether the FAA regulations permit Air Canada to fly over U.S.-space with a PIC over the age of 60 en route to foreign destinations.\n[208] Ms. McPherson\u2019s response was that the U.S. applies the current ICAO standard to foreign air carriers operating within its airspace. Prior to November 23, 2006, the U.S. did not allow flights through its territory by foreign air carrier where the PIC was over age 60. This applied even where there was no landing in the U.S.\n[209] According to Ms. McPherson, the ICAO standard also prevented a foreign air carrier from using a U.S. airport as a planned alternate airport except in the case of an emergency that required a landing in the U.S. The U.S. does not apply the ICAO standard to a second-in-command (\u201cSIC\u201d). Under the post-November 23, 2006 ICAO standard, the U. S. allows foreign air carriers to use a PIC or SIC age 60 or over if one of them is under the age of 60.\n(iii) Arlo Speer [210] Mr. Speer is the Chief of Flight Crew Licencing and Aircraft Registration with Transport Canada, the civil aviation authority for Canada. His responsibilities relate to flight crew licencing, the maintenance and establishment of the regulatory infrastructure for the licencing of flight crew in Canada, providing interpretations to the Canadian Aviation Regulations, in particular to Part 4 as it relates to flight crew licencing and to the periodic amendments and revisions to those requirements as necessary.\n[211] Mr. Speer testified on behalf of the Complainants. He explained. from the perspective of the regulatory authority, the relationship between Canada and the Chicago Convention. As a Contracting State, Canada shares with its fellow states the obligation to develop and maintain a safety oversight and regulatory structure for aviation that's consistent with the requirements of the ICAO standards, inasmuch as those requirements are consistent with the laws of the individual states. Canada's obligation is to adhere to the standards that have been agreed upon internationally by ICAO to the extent that those standards are consistent with Canadian requirements.\n[212] The ICAO standards produce an obligation on the ICAO contracting states that they will develop a regulatory structure that is consistent with the ICAO standards. There is an obligation on pilots and other operators within the aviation system to adhere to the regulatory structure that has been imposed either by the state that has provided its licenses or certificates or by the state in which the operation is conducted. So the regulatory framework comes from the state not from the standard itself.\n[213] The ICAO standards have been implemented in Canada in Part 4 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations which provide the licencing requirements for flight crew. With a very small number of exceptions, the Canadian licencing standards are consistent with the ICAO standards and in many cases also with the ICAO recommended practices. The recommended practices are not required to be implemented by the member states. The expectation is that member states will implement the standards, but the recommended practices are recommendations and are not obligatory on the member states.\n[214] Mr. Speer explained that if a member state does not want to incorporate an ICAO standard into its regulations, the expectation is it will file a difference with ICAO. The fact that a state does not adhere to a particular ICAO standard becomes a matter of public record for the other ICAO Contracting States. The differences that Canada has filed are set out in the licencing section of the Aeronautical Information published by Transport Canada.\n[215] Canada has filed a difference with respect to Article 2.1.10 of ICAO Annex 1. The difference reads that Canada does not curtail privileges of pilots who have attained their 60th birthday. There are two reasons why this difference was filed. The primary reason being that the refusal to issue licenses or grant privileges purely on the basis of age was seen as contravening the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The second reason was based on medical advice received from TC medical advisors that, from a licencing perspective, age alone is not a valid basis on which to predict the potential of sudden incapacitation.\n[216] Each Contracting State issues its own licence and conducts its own medical certification. Canada\u2019s position is that if the licence is medically valid, Canada will accept a licence from any ICAO Contracting State regardless of the age of the holder. Canada imposes on foreign pilots the same expectations and obligations as imposed on Canadian pilots.\n[217] Canada accepts pilots operating into Canada who are licenced by another State so long as they conform with the CARS regulations and they conform with the terms of the licence of their licencing authority.\n[218] Canadian Aviation Regulations relate to Canadian licence holders and Canadian aircraft wherever they are. For flights coming into Canada it is Canadian regulations that apply. The regulations of the country that issued the pilot's licence would also apply.\n[219] If a foreign pilot operating a foreign aircraft in Canada exceeds the privileges of the licence issued by the foreign state, that pilot would be potentially guilty of contravening CARS and also potentially be guilty of an infraction against the foreign regulation.\n[220] Typically what would happen is that Canadian enforcement authorities and those of the foreign state would work together so that the pilot would not be charged with the violation of two separate but effectively equivalent laws.\n[221] Mr. Speer pointed out that the ICAO Convention recognizes the serenity of the individual Contracting States and leaves with those Contracting States the authority to generate whatever regulatory requirements they choose. There is an expectation through ICAO membership that Canada will match its regulatory requirements as much as possible to the ICAO standards.\n[222] For example there are some pilot licenses for which Canada requires a greater degree of experience, knowledge or skill than specified by ICAO and so is more restrictive than the ICAO requirements. There are other examples such as the maximum age limit for pilots as discussed above, where Canada has chosen to be less restrictive and not impose the ICAO standard.\n[223] Mr. Speer referred to Article 39(b) of the Convention. He said that this requires Canada to make an annotation on any document\/licences it issues when the holder does not comply with the international standards. For example, TC issues a licence type rating for relief pilots on long range flights who have not been qualified for the take off and departure phase and for the approach and landing phase of the flight. They are rated for the cruise stage of a long range flight.\n[224] Mr. Speer was asked about a scenario where a Part 121 flight (as defined under 14 CFR and which is the equivalent to Part 7 of the CARS) departs from Seattle and travels through Canadian air space enroute to Anchorage. He was asked how does Transport Canada view the operation of that flight while it's in US air space with respect to crew licencing.\n[225] He said that the best answer that he can provide is to refer to Canada's difference which says Canada has no objections to pilots over 60 who hold a medically and otherwise valid licence issued by an ICAO contracting from flying foreign aircraft in Canada. So assuming that the operation is consistent with US law and the documents presented confirm that it would be, then Canada would have no objection to the operation of any aircraft, Part 121 or otherwise, in Canadian air space.\n(iv) Harlan Clark [226] In addition to giving evidence relating to s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, Mr. Clark also testified on the s. 15(1)(a) issue. He said that there are approximately 3,000 pilots currently employed at Air Canada and there has not been a lot of variance in the last ten years. For new hires Air Canada looks for is between 2,500 and 3,000 hours of flying time and they have to hold an Air transport pilot licence (\u201cATPL\u201d).\n[227] The typical background of those who do get hired is the smaller airlines or the military. Because of the number of hours of fixed wing flying that Air Canada looks for, they do have to have a fair amount of experience flying before they come to Air Canada.\n[228] New pilots hired at Air Canada enter the company through the Position Group which consists of EMJ170\/190 first officer, B767 relief pilot, B787 relief pilot, A340 relief pilot, B777 relief pilot.\n[229] Air Canada\u2019s fleet consists of the B777, A330 and B767, which are all wide-bodied aircraft; the A321\/A320\/A319 and the EMJ190\/175. Pilot jobs are divided into 16 non-interchangeable positions, being captain, first officer and relief pilot on the wide-bodied aircraft and captain and first officer on the other aircraft. Each Air Canada pilot is trained and rated on one aircraft type at any point in time and are only able to fly that particular aircraft type.\n[230] Pilots progress through their careers at Air Canada on the basis of seniority. Through the Crew Manning Steering Committee (\u201cCMSC\u201d) review held at least twice per year (and can be up to four times), pilots submit their Standing Preferential Bid (\u201cSPB\u201d) for their position which determines their status, equipment and their base.\n[231] In addition to the SPB there is the monthly bid. On a monthly basis pilots bid their schedule. Depending on their seniority, they will be awarded a block i.e. the pairings or flights that they will be flying in that month. They can also use their seniority to bid the quality of their schedule such as days off, vacation time.\n[232] Pilots who want to change aircraft type, status or base have the opportunity to do so through the SPB. If they have enough seniority to hold that position, it would be awarded through the CMSC bid process and they would eventually be trained for that position. But even though rated, when it comes time to bid the monthly work schedule, they may not have sufficient seniority to be a blockholder. In this case, they would go on the reserve.\n[233] Reserve pilots are on call to backfill when required such as when the scheduled pilot calls in sick or for other reasons cannot make the flight. They have a monthly schedule that sets out the days they are on call and would fly the aircraft for which they are rated.\n[234] It is important not to confuse reserve pilots with relief pilots. Relief pilot (\u201cRP\u201d) is a position, whereas a reserve pilot is where they end up on the monthly schedule. So there is regularly scheduled relief pilots and on-call reserve pilots on any given aircraft type, on any given month.\n[235] A relief pilot is a more junior pilot and is the third pilot in a three-pilot crew on a wide body aircraft. For international flights over a certain amount of duty time, a third pilot is required to ensure that the captain and first officer receive the prescribed rest time while operating the aircraft. But a relief pilot can be on the flight deck only for the cruise portion of the flight. They are not rated for all phases of flight such as takeoff and landing or flight 10,000 feet above ground level.\n[236] If a pilot successfully bids for a new position through the CMSC bid process, they would receive transition training on the aircraft successfully bid on which may not be scheduled for another year. So pilots, after a CMSC review, will hold both their current qualified position and their CMSC awarded position until retrained.\n[237] In addition to the initial training when a pilot joins Air Canada and transition training, there is captain upgrade training and annual recurrent training. Initial training involves ground school\/pilot indoctrination course, then simulator training followed by a line check. Air Canada has pilots that are qualified by Transport Canada to be check pilots. They fly with pilots in training on what's called a check ride. Once the pilot successfully concludes the check ride, they are rated on that aircraft.\n[238] Training for a new hire takes about two months. The initial training is the longest, because the ground school is longer. For transition training there is some ground school, simulator and a check ride and may take eight to ten weeks.\n[239] Captain upgrade training involves some ground school for leadership and operational control. Recurrent training is where pilots rated on a certain aircraft type attend regularly scheduled simulator sessions to maintain their rating on that aircraft. These are generally one-day sessions. Changing status, even on the same equipment type, requires training, some simulator time and a check ride but it would not be full transition training.\n[240] Mr. Clark estimated that it would cost approximately $30,000-$40,000 to train a pilot from one position to another. A large part of the costs would be unproductive salary for pilots. There would be the backfilling when the pilot is off the line and it is necessary to cover using other pilots to fly those routes while they're in training and not productive. There is also the cost of instructor salaries and the cost of running the simulator.\n[241] In addition to the pay formula, the collective agreement also provides for a minimum monthly guarantee (MMG) and that is linked to the designated monthly maximum (DMM). For a reserve pilot where the DMM is 70 hours, the MMG is 65 hours. This is the minimum number of hours that a reserve pilot is guaranteed to be paid whether or not they fly those hours. For a blockholder, the MMG is 60 hours and the DMM is 70 hours. The difference being a reserve pilot is on call and may or may not be required to fly those hours in the month.\n[242] Seniority comes into play as a factor into how much a pilot earns, because seniority determines monthly schedule and the number of flying hours in the month. As pilots accrue seniority, they can bid on higher rated equipment types and if they have the seniority to hold it they attract the higher pay for the larger equipment type.\n[243] Air Canada has permanent management pilots who hold management functions but remain on are on the seniority list. They do not bid on the CMSC review or on the monthly schedules. They are rated on certain aircraft and must fly on a regular basis to maintain their competency. Permanent management pilots can \"return to the line\u201d, that is relinquish their management duties and go back to being a line pilot.\n(v) Edward Tarapasky [244] Mr. Tararpasky is the Manager of Crew Scheduling in charge of automation and process for flight operations. He has been in that position for four years and has been with Air Canada for 25 years.\n[245] For this hearing, Mr. Tarapasky prepared a document entitled \u201cSpecial Preferential Bidding Accommodation Experiments\u201d.\n[246] The conclusion reached by these experiments was that if mandatory retirement no longer existed at Air Canada, at some point the PBS would not be able to produce a block\/monthly flying schedule for its pilots and it could not fly this monthly schedule.\n[247] The Preferred Bidding System is a computer program that analyzes data and produces schedules based on pre-set rules and pilot bid preferences and produces a block A block is a pilot\u2019s monthly flying schedule. To build a block, the computer takes into account current months flying, pre-planned absences such as training, vacations, check rides, next month\u2019s flying and regulatory and contractual constraints.\n[248] The monthly block is broken down into pairings. A Pairing is a series of flights and can consist of one or more operating or deadhead flights. A deadhead flight is a start, middle or end of a pairing assignment where a pilot is not on the flight deck and is going to a destination in order to operate another flight.\n[249] The Marketing department produces a marketing plan setting out the schedule of flights for the destinations for the next month and specifying the aircraft and the frequency of flights which is sent by electronic transfer to the Crew Analysts who input this information into the PBS.\n[250] In addition to this data, there are two groups of files that go into the PBS, Day of Flight information consisting of seven files and five Pairing files, one for each piece of equipment and bid preferences This is what each pilot uses to indicate the type of flying they prefer or wish to avoid. This data plus the pilots\u2019 bid preferences are used to build the blocks and pairings for the next month.\n[251] The PBS has five categories of bid preferences and 74 individual bids and uses a weighted bid system. This system assigns a value of points (0-1000) indicating to PBS how desirable or avoidable a particular bid is for a pilot. PBS proceeds in order of seniority to calculate the best possible points score for each pilot. The more senior the pilot, the higher the point score. The higher point score usually indicates a pilot very high on the seniority list who would usually be awarded their preferences.\n[252] Mr. Tarapasky explained that there are a number of constraints that go into the PBS to produce a block. Some arise out of the collective agreement such as the DSM and the open time per month rule. Other constraints come from CARs, for example, the rule which limits stick time to 40 hours within seven consecutive days, 120 hours within any 30-day period and a minimum rest time of three consecutive days off within any 17-24 day period. PBS will consider these rules when constructing the blocks for the next month.\n[253] For the purposes of these experiments, Mr. Tarapasky added a further constraint, the ICAO \u201cover\/under rule\u201d to determine how PBS could assign pairings to create blocks, that is, produce a \u201csolution\u201d. The basic rules for the experiments were one captain (\u201cCA\u201d) and one FO per flight and no two potentially restricted pilots, i.e. both pilots over the age of 60 on the same flight.\n[254] The first accommodation experiment involved 10 CAs an 10 FOs for 10 flights and assumed that 40% of the captains and 40% of the FOs were potentially restricted. PBS always runs the CAs solutions first, the FOs second. In this example, there is no limiting factor for the captain solutions and the most senior CA would have their choice of the ten flights. The next most senior CA would have the choice of nine flights down to the tenth CA who would have the last flight remaining, for a total of 55 choices.\n[255] However in the case of the FOs, because 40% of the CAs were potentially restricted the most senior FO could only fly with captains five through ten which means they only has six choices of flights not the ten the FO would have normally have.\n[256] The FO\u2019s choices fall to 39 rather than 55 in the absence of the over\/under rule. Air Canada relied on this accommodation experiment to demonstrate how crew member satisfaction is impacted when additional restrictions such as the over\/under restriction is introduced.\n[257] The next experiment run by Mr. Tarapasky assumed that seven out of ten CAs, i.e. 70% and four out of ten FOs, 40%, are potentially restricted. His conclusion is that no solution can be produced and in order to operate the ten flights, Air Canada would have to add new pilots or reduce the number of flights\n[258] As before, the CAs\u2019 solutions are run first. So there is no effect on the solutions and the choices for the captains. But when the FO solutions are run, the most senior FO will have only three choices of flights because no two potentially restricted pilots may fly together.\n[259] FO number 2 has two choices; FO number 3 only has one choice available. When you get to FO number 4, the solution does not run because the solution must solve all ten pairings and there is no solution because there are no pairings that FO number 4 could fly with without breaking the over\/under rule.\n[260] The next experiments asked the question, what number of potentially restricted pilots can Air Canada accommodate. These experiments focussed on wide-body equipment, B-777, B-767 and A-330 at the Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal bases. The purpose of these experiments was to identify the number of pilots Air Canada could accommodate over age 60 in a given month and still meet its ICAO obligations if mandatory retirement was abolished.\n[261] These experiments are not based on any particular number of pilots hypothetically employed past age 60. They were run using the actual flying operations of Air Canada and the actual bidding preferences of its pilots for the month of June 2009 with the added constraint of the ICAO over\/under rule.\n[262] The first experiment was for June 2009 Toronto 777 FO. There were 104 CAs and 136 FOs holding those positions on the B777 at that time. This experiment produced these results. Any combination of 10% to 40% of CAs and 10% to 50% of FOs would produce a solution, i. e. a monthly block and pairings.\n[263] It was only when it reached the level of 50% CAs (52) and 50% FOs (68) all over the age of 60, that PBS was not able to find a solution. This means hypothetically that Air Canada could not operate this equipment from the Toronto base.\n[264] The next experiment is a Score Analysis for June 2009, Toronto, B777 FO. The purpose here was to assess the impact on the solution of introducing another constraint into PBS, the over\/under rule-potentially restricted pilots over age 60. What Mr. Tarapasky did here was to compare the actual original June 2009 block solution for a random number of Toronto B777 FOs against the solution that solved immediately before the No solution occurred and analyse the score differences between the two solutions.\n[265] PBS uses a weighted bid points system (0-1000) indicating to PBS how desirable or avoidable a particular bid is for a pilot. PBS proceeds in order of seniority to calculate the best possible points score for each pilot. The higher point score usually indicates a pilot very high on the seniority list who would usually be awarded their preferences.\n[266] The results of the score analysis were that, of the total number of Toronto FOs in June 2009, the restriction produced a negative impact on 57 FOs but for 47 FOs there was no change and for 43 FOs it had a positive impact. A negative impact means that the pilot received less points than were originally awarded in June 2009 than if there had not been any potentially restricted pilots in the PBS.\n[267] No change means that pilots had a score equal to what they were awarded. Improved means that their score increased. This could occur when senior FOs do not get what they bid for, that flying gets forced to other parts of the solution so that junior pilots\u2019 score would increase and they would get a better award because PBS needs to find a FO under age 60.\n[268] In this scenario, there would be no impact on the CAs because the PBS runs the solutions sequentially with no restrictions on the CAs. It is only the FOs who are affected. Every time a FO solution is looked at, PBS considers the captain solutions to ensure that the over\/under rule is met before the FO is given an award.\n[269] But Mr. Tarapasky said the pilots would not know whether they were improved or negatively impacted. They would just see their final score and would not know what they could have attained. This exercise is just to show the differences that would occur between the original block versus the restricted block and how pilot satisfaction could be affected.\n[270] Mr. Tarapasky used the same methodology for the rest of the experiments. For June 2009 Vancouver B777 FOs, the actual number of pilots was 46 CAs and 73 FOs. In this experiment, a No solution was only reached at the level of 50% potentially restricted CAs and 30% potentially restricted FOs. Any combination of percentages below those levels would produce a solution. The score analysis was 23 negative, 17 no change and 23 improved.\n[271] For June 2009 Vancouver A330 FO, this experiment showed a total of 30 CAs and 35 FOs. The PBS produced a solution for every percentage combination of CAs and FOs until the combination of 30% CAs and 50% FOs was reached. The score analysis was 8 negative, 14 no change and 4 improved.\n[272] For the June 2009 767 Toronto FO there was a total of 136 CAs and 119 FOs. The PBS produced a solution for every percentage combination of CAs and FOs until the combination of 40% CAs and 50% FOs was reached. The score analysis for the FOs was 47 negative, 16 no change and 51 improved.\n[273] The June 2009 Toronto A330 FO produced a solution for every percentage combination of CAs and FOs until 50% CAs and 50% FOs was reached. The June 2009 Montreal B777 FO, 13 CAs and 12 FOs, shows a PBS solution for every percentage combination of CAs and FOs until 50% CAs and 40% FOs was reached.\n[274] The June 2009 Vancouver B767 FO, 89 CAs and 78 FOs, produced a solution for every percentage combination until 60% CAs and 50% FOs. For June 2009 Montreal B767 FO, the same was true until the 50% CAs and 50% FOs level was reached.\n[275] Mr. Tarapasky was asked whether in any of the experiments he used augment pilots and relief pilots. He replied that augment pilots are part of the FO solution because they are fully qualified first officers.\n(vi) Professor Johnathan Kesselman [276] Professor Kesselman gave evidence for the Complainants. He obtained his Ph.D from the Department of Economics in 1972 from the Massachusetts of Technology. He is the author of numerous publications in economic and labour economics. He has been a professor in this academic field for more than 30 years and currently teaches the Masters graduate program in Public Policy at Simon Fraser University. He also holds a Canada Research Chair in public finance. He was qualified to give expert opinion in this matter.\n[277] Professor Kesselman first testified on the question of how much longer Air Canada pilots would work if mandatory retirement was removed. Beginning with very broad empirical findings on the effects on retirement ages in jurisdictions that have ended mandatory retirement, there are statistical studies that have found typically a small positive effect and in some studies find the effect was statistically insignificant.\n[278] These are traditionally jurisdictions where age 65 was the binding age. In fact not a large number of people in most occupations want to work longer than age 65 and the average retirement age in the Canadian labour force is well under 65, more on the order of 61 or 62.\n[279] In the case of pilots there are no empirical studies about how much longer will pilots work if the constraint of age 60 is removed. When Professor Kesselman referred to studies of jurisdictions that have abolished mandatory retirement at age 65, that was for background and he is not using that evidence to predict what will occur with Air Canada pilots.\n[280] However, because of the lifestyle, the enjoyment of flying, and the high pay he would expect there to be a larger inducement toward continued work for pilots than for the general population where there is almost no effect on average working years.\n[281] He said that there is some evidence in this case from the Survey\u2013Retirement Age of Pilots for Air Canada that, for the four and a half year period, 2005-mid-2009, 21% of Air Canada pilots retired before age 60. In some of these years, Air Canada offered early retirement packages as an inducement to early retirement with no pension reduction.\n[282] The evidence that he used was that over that full period, 2005-2009, 21% of pilots, 107 out of 515 retired early, that is, prior to attaining age 60. For 2005 and 2009, he was aware that there was an early retirement incentive package but he did not have the details of the incentive package.\n[283] But he pointed out that in the intervening years there were also early retirements and no early retirement incentives. His response was to eliminate the periods with early retirement incentives and focus on the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 to abstract the possible effects of early retirement incentives and consider behaviour without them. In the years 2006, 2007 and 2008, there were 40 out of a total of 328 Air Canada pilots, over 12%, who retired early.\n[284] In terms of incentives for pilots to stay on past the age of 60, he agreed that for someone who has not maximized their years of service or their earnings under the pension plan, that could be an incentive to stay. As he already said that has to be offset against the other factors that he also described. He also agreed that even if someone has maxed out the years if they have an opportunity to increase their earnings for the purpose of calculating their best five years, that\u2019s another incentive to stay.\n[285] Beyond that it does not pay to lose those years of pension benefits which might be 60% of full time earnings to work for 40% of those accustomed earnings. And that does not seem so attractive relative to leisure, working elsewhere or whatever the individual might choose.\n[286] He agreed that his view would be somewhat tempered when considering a typical senior pilot\u2019s monthly schedule that requires the pilot to work only eight days per month with all weekends off. In addition, a 25-year pilot receives generous vacation time and four days off in lieu of statutory holidays. This type of schedule could be an incentive for a pilot to stay on.\n[287] Professor Kesselman estimated that promotions would be delayed for younger pilots by about nine months. So pilots would give up nine months in delay of their promotion, the normal seniority and the type and size of aircraft and greater earnings. But they could make this up at age 60 by working another nine months. Or they can work another year or two years, three years, five years. So it gives them a very valuable option.\n[288] In the end, Professor Kesselman concluded that he could not find any empirical study that would give a number, or even give a ballpark number of how many pilots would choose to work beyond age 60 at Air Canada and the numbers of years they will actually work.\n[289] His position was that any evidence brought by anyone to this proceeding on the likely number of pilots who actually decide to work beyond age 60 would be only guesstimates and at best based upon indirect evidence. He does not claim any precision and does not believe that anyone else coming to this can claim any more precision or any certainty.\n[290] Professor Kesselman then focussed on the question of the likely impact of removing mandatory retirement for pilots at age 60 on Air Canada's ability to schedule flight crew while respecting the preferential bidding. In this respect he commented on the evidence of the accommodation experiments done by Mr. Tarapasky.\n[291] Professor Kesselman referred to the evidence of invitations to attend retirement dinners for Air Canada pilots sponsored by ACPA and Air Canada held in Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver 2008 and 2009. These invitations list the names and status of the retirees who are retiring at age 60.\n[292] He calculated that less than 10% of those forced to retire at age 60 were FOs. That indicates that most pilots attain the rank of captain by the mandatory retirement age. In his opinion, to assume, as did Mr. Tarapasky, that 30, 40 or 50 % of FOs would be over age 60 is not realistic.\n[293] Even in the absence of this evidence, Professor Kesselman challenged Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s assumptions that FOs today will remain first officers indefinitely and not get promoted to captain. First officers, whether they're 59 or 55 or 45, by and large will become captains before they retire.\n[294] If there is a relaxation of the age 60 barrier, those who were forced to retire at age 60 as first officers, if they wanted to stay on, would do so to get more years and to increase their pay. So they would likely attain the rank of captain before they did retire, whether it was age 62 or 66 or whatever.\n[295] In his opinion, Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s assumptions in his model that first officers would remain first officers and a high proportion of first officers would be over the age of 60 are not necessarily valid, given the variant ages at hiring and other factors affecting promotions.\n[296] Professor Kesselman said that the pilots at the top of the seniority in each classification are not necessarily the ones that will be over 60. Seniority is by years of service at Air Canada. Pilots may be hired at different ages and there could be some individuals with higher seniority but lesser age and vice versa. More first officers will tend to be younger and over time without mandatory retirement, it would be easier to satisfy the over\/under rule.\n[297] Mr. Tarapasky's model requires much higher percentages of FOs being over age 60, in most cases 30%, 40% or even 50% before it runs into this gridlock, where it can't do the matching, can't satisfy the over\/under rule.\n[298] Professor Kesselman had another concern and that related the sequential manner used in Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s model as it tried to mimic the bidding system while trying to fulfill the ICAO requirement. Professor Kesselman pointed out that first there was sequential bidding by captains in the sequence of their seniority, then bidding by first officers in their seniority sequence.\n[299] If the PIC on a flight is over age 60, the operating first officer must be under age 60. Pairings that do not satisfy that constraint are ruled out. But long haul flights require an augment pilot who would be under age 60 under ICAO where both the PIC and the operating FO were over age 60.\n[300] Professor Kesselman concluded that the logic of Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s model has fundamental deficiencies. If the logic of the model was sequential reasoning, Mr. Tarapasky should have included another sequence, namely, consideration of the augment pilot on long haul international flights.\n[301] It is true that with respect to his comments on augment pilots, he did not know that in 2009, of the total flying hours of Air Canada, only two percent had augment pilots on the flights. Further, Mr. Tarapasky had indicated that augment pilots were taken into account in his experiments as they are generally first officers.\n(vii) Captain Steven Duke [302] Captain Duke, is the General Manager of Crew Resources at Air Canada. Crew Resources is responsible for running the equipment bids, the allocation of the flying every month between bases and the setting of the DMMs to determine how much the pilots, each pilot is flying that month.\n[303] Captain Duke testified with respect to a study that he prepared, \u201cAir Canada and Pilot Retirement, October 2009.\u201d There are two general sections. First, background on the Air Canada pilots which deals with the structure of Air Canada's pilot group and the Crew Manning Steering Committee review and position bidding process.\n[304] The second section relates to Undue Hardship on Air Canada and deals with the inability to have captains over 65 fly internationally and domestically; the very limited ability of Air Canada to accommodate captains or first officers who are over age 60; and then the fact that retirement at age 60 has been predictable and stable.\n[305] Captain Duke described the pilot jobs at Air Canada as being divided into 16 groups geographically separated into 44 positions. These groups are B777, captain, first officer and relief pilot; A330 captain, first officer and relief pilot; B767, captain, first officer and relief pilot; A319\/320\/321 captain and first officer; EMJ captain and first officer.\n[306] Pilot status is not interchangeable. Captains cannot act a first officers. First officers cannot act as captains. And relief pilots cannot act as either captains or as first officers. However both captains and first officers can act as relief pilots. Captains and first officers are trained to operate all phases of flight. A relief pilot can operate only the cruise phase of a flight.\n[307] Seniority is of fundamental importance for pilots at Air Canada. It is correlated with position and determines status, equipment and base. Different salaries are associated with each equipment status. It can go from a low of an Embraer first officer at $85,000\/year to a high of a B777 captain of $244,000\/year.\n[308] Further, higher seniority brings with it more favourable monthly and vacation schedules. A typical B777 captain\u2019s monthly schedule consists of eight days per month of flying and weekends off. A mid-seniority pilot\u2019s schedule would have twelve days per month and working weekends. The less seniority, the less favourable the monthly schedule.\n[309] In the second part of Captain Duke\u2019s evidence, he raised four issues. The first issue deals with the inability of Air Canada to have captains over age 65 fly internationally.\n[310] As explained by Mr. Elfassy and Mr. Speer, prior to November 23, 2006, the ICAO Annex 1 standard restricted Air Canada PICs past age 60 from operating in foreign airspace. After November 23, 2006, ICAO restricts Air Canada from PICs that are over 65 from operating in foreign airspace.\n[311] This divides Air Canada pilots into different sub-positions, PICs who are age 65 and older that are restricted; PICs 60-65 who are potentially restricted; and PICs under age 60 who are unrestricted. FOs over 60 who are potentially; FOs under 60 who are unrestricted; and RPs who are unrestricted.\n[312] For the B777 93% of the flying is international. For the A-330, 90% is international flying. The B767 is 80% international flying. The A320 is 48% international flying and the EMJ is 46%. Captain Duke said flights on the three wide-bodied aircraft cannot be operated by PICs over age 65.\n[313] Issue No. 2 is the inability to have Air Canada PICs over 65 fly domestically. Captain Duke defined domestic flying as a flight that leaves a Canadian airport and lands at a Canadian airport. International flying is anything else. He said that if he was to consider anything at all, it would to be the A320 and EMJ aircraft.\n[314] The problem that Captain Duke identified here is that 88% of Air Canada\u2019s domestic flying hours involves overflying US airspace. For example, Toronto-Montreal flights overfly New York State. Toronto to Halifax flights overfly New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Toronto to Vancouver flights overfly Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana.\n[315] Of the remaining 12% percent, Air Canada flights may hold an alternate airport in the US. Alternate airports and the selection of alternate airports are necessary because of adverse weather at the destination. For example, flights into Toronto hold Niagara Falls, New York or Buffalo as alternate airports. Flights into Vancouver hold Seattle as an alternate.\n[316] Not all flights hold alternate airports. It is weather dependent. The selection of alternate airports has to do with adverse weather at the destination. Captain Duke could not answer with certainty how many of the 12% holds alternates. It is dependent upon the weather on the day of the flight. But if Air Canada does not have the option of U.S. alternates the result may be cancelling the flight or going hundreds of miles out of the way north around the weather.\n[317] As to the possibility of rerouting domestic flights that overfly the U.S. to keep them solely within Canadian airspace, Captain Duke\u2019s evidence is that increases the flight time, increases costs and it will make subsequent flights late. For example, he compared the time taken and the fuel burned using the most optimal route from Toronto to Halifax versus a route that stays solely in Canadian airspace.\n[318] Captain Duke estimated that to reroute the 117 A320 and EMJ flights per week from Toronto to Halifax and Halifax to Toronto would cost an additional $5.7m per year.\n[319] Air Canada operates 1600 domestic flights per week which overfly the U.S. Captain Duke estimated that, to fly the same schedule for A320 flights that do not overfly the U.S. would involve 1,720 additional flying hours, 21 additional flight crews and accounting for reserve coverage and vacation, the increased costs to Air Canada would be $7.7m per year. He also estimated that the additional costs for the Embraer fleet isolating flights that do not overfly the US would amount to $6.6m per year.\n[320] Captain Duke then addressed Issue No. 3, the limited ability of Air Canada to manage both captains and first officers who are over age 60. His point here is Air Canada can only accommodate a very limited number of potentially restricted pilots before pilot scheduling becomes unworkable without increasing costs. He produced a number of graphs and tables which provide a snapshot of Air Canada\u2019s pilot demographics as at September 2009.\n[321] They show the numbers and percentages of captains and first officers by base and equipment. For example, 53\/58=91% of B777 Vancouver captains are age 55 or older. For Toronto, it is 101\/115=88% of captains who are 55 or older. What is particularly interesting is the contrast between the captains and first officers. Only 21\/82=26% of Vancouver first officers are age 55 or older.\n[322] Captain Duke then prepared a bar chart in which he projected what the demographics for captains and first officers would be in 2014 and 2019. His projection assumed that there would be no retirements, i.e.100% of pilots would stay on. He said these projections represent the worst case scenario and simply point out Air Canada\u2019s maximum liability.\n[323] It is not clear as to the purpose of this information. When questioned Captain Duke said, \u201cYou know what? To be honest, I wish I\u2019d left all the demographic stuff out. I don\u2019t think it adds a whole lot\u2026. I don\u2019t think that they add very much value because they do not necessarily predict what is actually going to happen, nor do they predict what Air Canada\u2019s demographics are going to be 10 years from now.\u201d He concluded that Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s experiments were much more instructive than his demographic evidence.\n[324] Captain Duke said that his understanding of Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s model was that it is completely independent of the demographics of Air Canada\u2019s pilot population now, in 10 years or 20 years or 30 years This model just sets up possible numbers that may occur at any time in the future and what would happen to the PBS and the monthly process if certain of potentially restricted pilots were to occupy these positions.\n[325] Captain Duke commented on the potential costs to Air Canada in the case where 80% CAs and 20% FOs are potentially restricted, a situation in Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s model which would not generate a solution. Captain Duke said that to operate that flight, one of the age 60 pilots would have to be taken out of the pairing and replaced by another pilot under age 60. If there is not enough flying time for the ineligible pilot, they would be paid the MMG but not flying. Should Air Canada have to promote one pilot that would cause one training course to stay on the workable feasible-infeasible side of the boundary.\n[326] There would have to be backfilling and eventually causing Air Canada to hire a new pilot. Captain Duke estimated that this could involve a total of seven training courses including the new hire. The average cost of a training course is $43,000 so the full training costs would be around $300,000. There is the further cost of paying the full salary of the pilot while on training.\n[327] He agreed that there would be reserve pilots qualified on the equipment who could replace the ineligible pilot. But that would reduce the reserve coverage and they would have to be replaced because otherwise you are increasing the operational risk by reducing the number of pilots on reserve.\n[328] Captain Duke also spoke to the subject of augment crews. Augment pilots are almost exclusively first officers. Generally a flight time over fourteen hours requires a crew of four, adding an augment pilot. Only the B777 has augment pilots and approximately 14% of all B777 flying has augment pilots. For all Air Canada\u2019s operations, augment pilots are on only 2.5% of the flights. About 22% of all B777 flying is done with relief pilots. And 7% of all of Air Canada\u2019s flying is with relief pilots.\n[329] Issue No. 4 as defined by Captain Duke, is that at Air Canada\u2019s retirement age of 60 has been stable and predictable. From May 25,1992 to June 2009, over 90% of Air Canada pilots retire at age 60. So there is a great deal of certainty as to when these pilots retire. This data includes early retirements and people who leave the airline for whatever reason. It also includes pilots who took early retirement incentive programs.\n[330] Captain Duke explained that each unexpected retirement (without notice) detrimentally affects Air Canada's operations and results in additional costs. To replace this person can take a full training period, a minimum of two months. And it may require the full CMSC review process to get an individual assigned to the new position. This may jeopardize Air Canada\u2019s ability to conduct a full operation.\n[331] His evidence was that any more than six unexpected retirements over three months in the Vancouver B777 captain cohort could cause flight cancellations and cost approximately $2.5m in revenue. This would not be an issue if the Tribunal were to order that pilots must give notice of retirement within a specified time period. Captain Duke acknowledged that economic incentives could be used to encourage this.\nD. Sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA and Meiorin [332] Section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA provides a defence to a claim of discrimination if the employer establishes that \u201cany refusal, exclusion, expulsion suspension, limitation, specification or preference is based on a bone fide occupational requirement\u201d(\u201cBFOR\u201d).\n[333] The test to be applied for determining whether the employer has established a BFOR, is that set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (P.S. Empl. Rel. Comm.) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d).\n[334] An employer must establish on a balance of probabilities that:\n1) the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job. The focus here is not on the validity of the standard but on the validity of its purpose;\n2) the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that work-related purpose; and\n3) the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the same characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship on the employer.\n[335] The Supreme Court softened the \u201cimpossibility\u201d aspect of the third step in Hydro-Quebec v. S.E.T.P. [2008] 2 S.C.R. 561, saying that the test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to accommodate an employee who does not meet the standard, but requires proof of undue hardship, which can take as many forms as there are circumstances.\nE. Sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) and ACPA [336] The Complainants argue that, on the wording of s. 15(1)(a) and the principle of expression unius est exclusio alterius, the BFOR defence is only available to an employer and not to an employee organization such as ACPA. A union may provide evidence to support an employer\u2019s BFOR defence but cannot do so for itself. The reference only to \u201cemployer\u201d in the Meiorin test gives weight to this argument. Further support for this position is found in s. 15(1)(f) of the CHRA where the BFOR defence is available to an employee organization as well as to an employer.\n[337] Although tempting, ultimately I do not accept this argument for two reasons. These complaints reference both s. 7 and s. 10 of the CHRA. If a discriminatory practise can be committed under s. 10, by an employer, an employee organization or an employer organization, how can it be, that of these three, only an employer can raise a BFOR defence. It doesn\u2019t make sense either in terms of policy or logic.\n[338] Second, I rely on the Supreme Court decision in Central Okanagan School District No.23 and CUPE v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 (\u201cRenaud\u201d) where a complaint was brought against both the employer and the union. The union refused to agree to the accommodation offered by the employer because of its impact on other employees.\n[339] The Court noted that a union may become a party to discrimination by participating in the formulation of a work rule that has a discriminatory effect on the complainant, e.g. if the rule forms part of the collective agreement.\n[340] The Court went on to say that in such case the union incurs liability (under the B.C. Human Rights Act which also provided for a BFOR) and must have the same right as an employer to justify the discrimination. In order to do so, it must discharge its duty to accommodate.\n[341] But the Complainants argue, even if ACPA can offer a BFOR defence apart from Air Canada, it has failed to satisfy the Meiorin test.\n[342] ACPA\u2019s explanation as to the purpose of the age 60 rule is that it negotiated a collective agreement which provided its members with security of employment, certainty of advancement, increase in salaries and significant pension income. All of these benefits are tied to a system of seniority. The mechanism that ACPA chose to distribute these benefits of seniority in a fair manner for all pilots was to include a requirement for mandatory retirement.\n[343] If the essence of what Air Canada pilots do is flying aircraft of varying sizes and types, transporting passengers to both domestic and international destinations, it is difficult to see how the age of the pilot bears any relationship to the performance of the job.\n[344] It is very telling that Transport Canada, the federal regulatory agency responsible for licencing commercial pilots, does not impose any maximum age restriction. In fact, in its submission to ICAO on the question of raising the maximum age of PICs for international flights, Canada\u2019s position was that there should not be any age restriction. Canada has no objections to pilots who are 60 years of age or older holding a medically valid licence from flying within Canadian airspace.\n[345] As to the second step of Meiorin, I do not question that the age 60 rule was adopted with an honest and good faith belief. But if it was not adopted for a purpose connected to the performance of the job, it cannot be necessary for the fulfillment of that work-related purpose.\n[346] For these reasons, I have concluded that ACPA has failed to satisfy steps one and two of the Meiorin test. The result is that ACPA cannot rely on the BFOR defence provided by s. 15(1)(a) of the CHRA.\n[347] Although, in the case of ACPA, it is not necessary to proceed to step three of Meiorin, it is nonetheless prudent for me to deal with the evidence that ACPA produced to support its position that the elimination of the age 60 rule would result in undue hardship to a significant number of its members.\n[348] Before doing so, I want to deal with the question of the factors the Tribunal can consider when assessing the whether a BFOR has been established. In Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (HRC) [1990] 2 S.C.R., the Supreme Court listed the factors that could be relevant to undue hardship as including financial cost, disruption of a collective agreement, problems of morale of other employees and interchangeability of work force and facilities. The Court went on to explain that this list was not meant to be exhaustive. (see: also McGill University Health Centre v, S.E.H.G.M. 2007 SCC 4).\n[349] In 1998 the CHRA was amended to add s. 15(2) which specified that the factors to be considered are health, safety and cost. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court pointed out that the relevant factors are not entrenched unless they are expressly included or expressly excluded by statute.\n[350] With s. 15(2) Parliament has expressly included the relevant factors to be considered in the determination of undue hardship. Apply again the expression unius est exclusio alterius principle and the principle that defences limiting the exercise of human rights conferred under human rights legislation are to be construed narrowly. The conclusion must be that the factors to be considered in the undue hardship analysis are limited to health, safety and cost.\n[351] ACPA\u2019s position is that there is no other way to accommodate the Complainants but to eliminate the age 60 retirement rule. To do so would impose an undue hardship on ACPA.\n(i) Rikk Salamat [352] ACPA tendered Rikk Salamat as an expert in collective agreement analysis and specifically in this case to give evidence regarding the potential career earnings of airline pilots if the age 60 rule is eliminated. He produced a report dated October 2009 setting out his analytical methodology and his general conclusions.\n[353] Mr. Salamat\u2019s general conclusions were that, for 14% of the active Air Canada pilots, the elimination of mandatory retirement offers a clear financial benefit. The remaining 86% of pilots will have to work past age 60 to maintain the same potential earnings they would have if the age 60 rule remained. For some in this latter group the decrease in career earnings is relatively small compared to the financial benefits of being able to work beyond age 60.\n[354] For those 29% of the 86% of pilots, working beyond age 60 would provide little additional earnings. And for 1% of the pilots they would receive no benefit from working any additional years. This is illustrated in the data below where Mr. Salamat grouped the active pilots into four categories which reflect his conclusions.\n\u27a2 Group 1: 14% of active pilots-\u201cNo Risk\u201d. These pilots will suffer no loss in career earnings whether or not they work past age 60.\n\u27a2 Group 2: 57% of active pilots-\u201cModerate Risk\u201d. This group will suffer from delays in career advancement. The financial impact of these delays can be offset by working past age 60. But the magnitude of the earnings loss they would suffer if they retired at age 60 is less than the benefits they would receive if they work to the same average as other pilots.\n\u27a2 Group 3: 28% of active pilots-\u201cSignificant Risk\u201d. As with group 2, these pilots will suffer from delays in career advancement that can be offset by working beyond age 60. However, the magnitude of the damages they would suffer if they retired at age 60 is greater than the benefits they would receive if they work to the same average age as other pilots.\n\u27a2 Group 4: 1% of active pilots-\u201cNo Benefit\u201d. This group of pilots will suffer a decrease in their career earnings even if they work as many years past age 60 as other pilots. The reason is that the near term losses these pilots will experience from lost advancement opportunities are large enough and their extra years of income so far into the future, that the latter cannot fully offset the former.\n[355] For his analytical model, Mr. Salamat started with all of the pilots on the January 2009 Air Canada pilot seniority list and projected one year into the future. He removed all the pilots who would have turned 60 by December 31, 2009 and assigned their positions by seniority order to pilots with lower seniority. This process was repeated for the next 35 years until all of the Air Canada pilots who are on the current seniority list have retired.\n[356] To calculate the financial impact, the model assumed the July 2008 pay scale and 80 hours worked per month and applied a three percent discount rate on future earnings to estimate the net present value of the total career earnings. (\u201cnpv\u201d).\n[357] The model then ran five alternative scenarios based on assumed average retirement ages of 61 to 65 instead of age 60. Rather than producing a data for all five scenarios, Mr. Salamat chose age 63 as the assumed average age of retirement. As to why he focussed on age 63, Mr. Salamat said that he works with pilots from a number of US airlines and the data suggests that pilots who stay on past age 60 generally work until age 63. He said that this is based on retirement patterns to date, some actuarial studies and expressed the interest that pilots have indicated in various surveys.\n[358] He did not produce any such patterns, studies or surveys. Nor is there any factual evidence to support this because there are no pilots yet in the US who have stayed on to age 63. The US law increasing pilot age to 65 only changed in December 2007. But on an aggregate level, it does not matter the age as long as everyone goes at the same age.\n[359] Mr. Salamat did not claim to know or have a definitive answer as to what age Air Canada pilots would retire at beyond age 60 if no mandatory retirement. Nor did he claim that the model could predict what choices pilots would make with respect working past that age.\n[360] Scenario No. 1, shows, by year and age in 2010, the cumulative impact, by year and age in 2010, on npv of career earnings with the average age at retirement increasing from 60 to 63. For pilots in the age 55 to 59 age group, in the year 2018, the cumulative impact is a positive $470,000. There is no negative impact for retiring at age 60.\n[361] Pilots aged 50-54, in year 2013, would have a negative npv of $70.000 at retirement age 60, but positive npv earnings of $328,000 at retirement age 63. For age group 45-49, the positive npv earnings would be $231,000 age 63 compared to $116,000 negative npv at age 60. In terms of the positive\/negative comparison, this holds true for the 45-49 and 40-44 age groups except that the magnitude of the difference diminishes with each lower age group.\n[362] It is only with the most junior pilots, those in the age groups, 35-39, 30-34 and 25-29 that the magnitude of the negative impact on npv earnings at retirement age 60 is more than the positive npv earnings at age 63. The reason for this latter effect is because up to this point in time the only impact that they have experienced are the delays. With each progressive year they are a little further and further behind.\n[363] Scenario No. 2 considered the average potential impact, by age in 2010, on npv of total career earnings of average age at retirement rising from age 60 to age 61-65. This graph shows that, for a pilot age 60 in the year 2010, the average potential impact on npv of total career earnings, if he worked to age to 63 is $560,000. This person would not suffer any negative impact on earnings loss if retired at age 60.\n[364] A 55 year old pilot would stand to gain npv of about $425,000 at age 63 and would suffer a negative npv of about $100,000. It is the youngest and least senior pilots where the magnitude of the negative impact on the npv earnings is far greater than the positive impact. A pilot age 27 would suffer a $227,000 loss at retirement age 60 and a $10,000 gain at retirement age 63.\n[365] The next Scenario, No. 3, considers the npv, by seniority number, of each additional year worked with average age at retirement rising from 60 to age 61-65. This reflects that there is a strong correlation between age and seniority. But Mr. Salamat said that this does not always hold true. You can be old and be at the top of the seniority list and you can be old and be at the bottom of the seniority list. You just can\u2019t be young and senior.\n[366] For a pilot who is number one on the seniority list, the value of working one more year to age 63 is $200,000 with no negative npv earnings at retirement age 60. A pilot, seniority number 1,500, would have a positive npv of about $100,000 at retirement age 63 and a negative npv of about $45,000 to retirement age 60.\n[367] The value of working to retirement age 63 for a junior pilot with the low seniority number of 3,500, is $15,000 and if this pilot retired at age 60 the npv would be a negative $71,000.\n[368] Scenario No. 4, shows the potential impact, by seniority number, on npv of total career earnings of average age at retirement going from 60 to age 63. For the most senior pilot, number 1 on the seniority list, if the average retirement age goes to 63, the additional total npv would be $597,000 with no downside at retirement age 60.\n[369] Seniority number 1,000 would realize a total npv of about $395,000 at retirement age 63 and negative npv of $100,000 at retirement age 60. The impact on the junior pilot, seniority number 3,000, retiring at age 60 would be a negative $215,000 and only rising to a negative $2,000 working to age 63.\n[370] Scenario No. 5 analyses the potential impact, by pilot position, on npv of total career earnings of average at retirement rising from 60 to age 61 to 65. For this analysis, the pilots were grouped according to the position that they held in September 2009. The positions were arranged from most senior to most junior.\n[371] Starting with the Embraer 190 first officers, with the lowest pay rate, this scenario shows the benefit to be $51,000 if they worked until age 63. For the B777 captain, the npv value of benefits of working to age 63 is $586,000.\n[372] For the Embraer first officer the cost of retiring at age 60 would be a negative $222,000 npv and for the B777 captain there will be no cost. The Embraer captain would gain about $230,000 at retirement age 63 and a loss of $18,000 at retirement age 60.\n[373] Scenario No. 6 is a scatter graph showing the impact on npv of career earnings average age at retirement rising from 60 to 63. It is a graphic illustration of the four pilot groups referred to earlier.\n[374] Mr. Salamat next produced a Table showing the impact on the average income for the last five years of employment by retirement at age 60. He assumed that the pension was based on the average of the last five years of earnings. (Air Canada\u2019s pension is based on the best 60 consecutive months).\n[375] Mr. Salamat explained that, whereas the previous scenarios illustrated what happens during the employment phase, this Table is intended to show the impact on pensionable earnings if pilot choose to retire at age 60 when the retirement age rises to age 61-65.\n[376] What the Table ultimately concludes is that the average impact on a pilot\u2019s earnings for pension purposes is $3,762 or 3% less if they retire at age 60 when the average retirement rises to age 61. If the average retirement age goes to 63 and the average pilot retires at 60 when the average age rises to 63, the negative impact will be $13,900, or eight percent less for pension purposes. And so on for the years, 62, 64 and 65.\n[377] Finally, Mr. Salamat presented a Table called Equipment Bid 09-01 at Bid Close. What this Table shows is the number of Air Canada pilots and their minimum, median, average and maximum ages by position as at January 2009. I have referenced only some of the position data, more particularly, those positions referred by Mr. Tarapasky and by Captain Duke in their pairings evidence.\n[378] According to this Table, there were 109 B777 Toronto captains in January 2009. The maximum age was 59 and the minimum age was 51.6 years. The median age was 58 and the average age 57 years.\n[379] There were 126 B777 Toronto first officers, the maximum age being 58.8 and the minimum age 40.8 years. The average age and median age of these first officers was about 51 years.\n[380] The B777 Vancouver position had 52 captains with a maximum age of 59 and a minimum age of 52.3 years. The median age was 57.5 and the average was 57 years. There were 76 Vancouver first officers, whose maximum age was 58.7 and a minimum age of 41.8 years. They had a median age of 52 and an average age of 54 years.\n[381] The data for B777 Montreal captains shows even lower ages. For the 15 captains, the maximum age was 57.3 and the minimum age was 51.4 years. The average age was 49 and there was no median age shown. For the 13 B777 Montreal first officers, the maximum age was 56.3 and the minimum age was 43.1 years. The median age was about 48 years and the average was about 47 years.\n[382] There were 50 Toronto A340 captains with a maximum age of 59 and a minimum age of 50.6 years. The median and average ages were about 55 years. For 44 first officers on the Toronto A340, the maximum age was 58.9 and the minimum age was 40.3 years. The median age was about 46 and the average was about 47.5 years.\n[383] Toronto had 162 B767 captains with a maximum age of 59 and a minimum age of 45.3 years. The median age was 54 and the average was 55 years. For the 130 Toronto B767 first officers the maximum age was 58.2. and the minimum was 35.8 years. The median and average ages were about 46 years.\n[384] There were 87 B767 Vancouver captains with a maximum age of 59 and a minimum of 50.8 years. The median was 54 and the average was 55 years. Of the 75 Vancouver B767 first officers, the maximum age was 57.6 and the minimum was 38.1 years. The median and average ages were 47 years.\n[385] Montreal B767 captains had a maximum age of 58.4 and a minimum age of 41 years. The median age was about 47 and the average age was 46 years.\n[386] There were 13 Montreal B767 captains with a maximum age of 58.4, a minimum of 41 years, a median age of 46 and an average age of 47 years.\n[387] According to Mr. Salamat\u2019s Table, there were 363 Toronto A320 captains in January 2009. Their maximum age was 58.9 and minimum age was 36.8 and an average of 48 years. The 341 Toronto A320 first officers had a maximum age of 56 and a minimum age of 25.8 years. The median and average ages for the first officers was 40 years.\n[388] The maximum age for the 39 Vancouver A320 captains was 58.9 and the minimum age was 46 years. The median and average ages were about 52 and 53 years. For the 37 Vancouver first officers, the maximum age was 52.4 and the minimum age was 28.1 years. The median and average age was just over 40 years.\n[389] Montreal had 80 captains at a maximum age of 58.3 and a minimum age of 36.9 years. The median age was 48 and the average was 47 years. The 78 Montreal first officers\u2019 maximum age was 58 and the minimum age was 32.2 years. The median age was 42 and the average age was 43 years.\n[390] The 31 Winnipeg A320 captains had an average age of 58.6 and a minimum age of 36.9 years. The maximum age of the Winnipeg first officers was 54.2 and the minimum age was 37.6 years. The median age was 46 and the average age was 45 years.\n[391] The maximum age for the EMJ captains for these bases ranged from 54.4 to 57.9. The range for the minimum age was 30 to 34.2 years. The EMJ first officers had a maximum range of 50.6 to 51.2 years. The minimum age ranged from 25.9 to 28 years.\n[392] Clearly the pattern that emerges from these scenarios is that the impact of eliminating the age 60 rule follows the age and more so the seniority of the pilots. If the age 60 retirement rule is eliminated, those pilots in Groups 1, 2 and 3 can choose to retire at age 60. The Group 1 pilots, who constitute 14% of the active pilots, will not suffer any earnings loss and they will receive significant earnings benefit to work to age 63.\n[393] The Group 2 pilots, 57% of active pilots, because of the delay in career advancement, will suffer an earnings loss. But if they work to age 63, they will receive positive earnings benefits which will be greater than their earnings loss.\n[394] The Group 3 pilots, 28% of the active pilots, because of the delay in career advancement will also suffer an earnings loss. But if they work to retirement age 63, they will receive positive earnings which will be less than the earnings loss.\n[395] It is Group 4, the most junior pilots, for whom the consequences are the most negative if retirement age 60 is eliminated. They make up 1% of the active pilots. They will suffer a significant loss if they choose to retire at age 60 and will continue to have a very small loss which may be greatly reduced to the point of being neutral, if they work to age 63.\nF. Conclusion on s. 15(1)(a) of the CHRA for ACPA [396] It is true that terminating the age 60 retirement rule would have a disproportionate impact on the younger pilots. There is also no question that the Complainants during their careers at Air Canada accepted and took the benefits of the very rule that they now seek to overturn. But acquiescence to the rule should not disentitle the Complainants from asserting their rights under the CHRA to be free from discrimination. The clean hands principle is not a mitigating factor at least for the issue of liability.\n[397] In Renaud, the Supreme Court said that \u201cthe use of the term \u201cundue\u201d implies that some hardship is acceptable. The extent to which the discriminator must go to accommodate is limited by the words \u2018reasonable\u201d and \u201cshort of undue hardship\u201d. These are not independent criteria but are alternate ways of expressing the same concept\u201d.\n[398] The question is what is the extent of the hardship that is acceptable in this case. Of the total number of active pilots employed by Air Canada in January 2009, 99% stand to benefit with positive earnings they worked to retirement age 63. There is no doubt that the more senior pilots would benefit to a greater extent, the value depending on the relative seniority levels. The downside for the less senior pilots is that their ability to choose to retire at age 60 would be negatively impacted in terms of their earnings.\n[399] The most significant impact would be on the most junior pilots. They would suffer a significant loss of earnings at retirement age 60 and at best would be in a no benefit position even if they work to retirement age 63.\n[400] If some degree of hardship is acceptable should it be the pilots whose ability to continue working at Air Canada was cut off at age 60 for no reason other that they attained age 60. Or should it be majority of the pilots for whom their ability to choose to retire at age 60 would now be more constrained but who would still be in a positive earnings position if they worked to age 63. This is not to underestimate the more serious impact on the younger pilots with the least seniority. But this group of pilots constitutes only 1% of the total Air Canada pilot cohort.\n[401] The choice is difficult. But in my opinion, the impact of eliminating the age 60 retirement rule does not reach the threshold of \u201cundue\u201d hardship. I have concluded therefore that ACPA has not satisfied the third step of the Meiorin test.\nG. Section 15(1)(a) and Air Canada [402] The first two steps of the Meiorin test require an assessment of the legitimacy of the standard\u2019s purpose and the bone fides of the employer in adopting the standard. This is not so much in dispute between the parties as is their disagreement on step 3, the accommodation obligation.\n[403] Air Canada\u2019s evidence is that 86% of its flights are international including those that overfly US air space enroute to Canadian destinations. Of the remaining 14%, between 20-25% of the flights may hold alternate US airports. Being able to fly lawfully within foreign airspace is integral to the job of Air Canada\u2019s pilots. Because of the ICAO standards imposing restrictions on pilot age for international flights, Air Canada asserts that it cannot accommodate pilots over age 60 without undue hardship.\n[404] The onus is on Air Canada to demonstrate that, if there was no mandatory age of retirement for its pilots, it would impose an undue hardship in terms of the costs to operate the airline business. The Complainants do not ask that Air Canada accommodate pilots as PICs over age 65. They argue that Air Canada has not demonstrated that it cannot accommodate pilots age 60-65.\n[405] The retirement dates of the Complainants run over the period 2005-2009. The amendments to the ICAO standards were amended effective November 23, 2006 in the period of the Complainants\u2019 retirements. Thus the issue of accommodation needs to be assessed both pre-November 23, 2006 to account for those pilots who retired prior to that date. There must also be a post-November 2006 for those pilots who retired after that date and because the Complainants are seeking to invalidate the mandatory rule for all Air Canada pilots.\n[406] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court felt that it would be useful to consider the procedure, if any, which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation and the substantive content of a more accommodating standard which was offered or the employer\u2019s reasons for not offering such a standard.\n[407] In this regard, it may be asked did the employer investigate alternative approaches that did not have a discriminatory effect. Or is there a way to do the job that is less discriminatory and still accomplish the employer\u2019s legitimate purpose.\n[408] The Complainants had no need for accommodation until they reached age 60 when they were forced to retire. The evidence of both Mr. Tarapasky and Captain Duke related primarily to the difficulties Air Canada would experience in the absence of the age 60 rule after the ICAO amendments.\n[409] But Air Canada did not offer any concrete evidence as to why it could not accommodate all over age 60 first officers before November 2006. There was nothing in the ICAO standard that prevented them from flying international flights so long as they satisfied Transport Canada licencing requirements.\n[410] As to Air Canada captains flying international routes as PICs before November 2006, there was no licencing restriction and no operational restrictions offered by Air Canada that would have precluded them from bidding into other pilot positions such as first officer.\n[411] Air Canada did not offer any accommodation nor even engage in any procedure to investigate alternate approaches that may have had a less discriminatory consequence. For these reasons, I find that Air Canada did not meet its obligation of accommodation at least in the pre-November 2006 era.\n[412] The next question is whether the evidence of Air Canada supports its contention that after November 2006, undue hardship will result if there is no age 60 retirement rule.\n[413] As I see it, the core of Air Canada\u2019s case are the conclusions of Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s experiments and the cost consequences that follow as interpreted by Captain Duke. There is no way to question the mathematical output of the experiments. But the input, the assumptions used by Mr. Tarapasky can be questioned.\n[414] The evidence is that certain combinations of potentially restricted captains and first officers reach a threshold whereby PBS cannot produce a block solution. This is with respect to Air Canada\u2019s wide-bodied aircraft. Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s assumption was that the pilots on these on these flights would be the most senior and the oldest of the Air Canada pilot groups.\n[415] Professor Kesselman challenged the validity of this assumption on the basis that in the absence of mandatory retirement, first officers would not remain such and would progress to captain status. Further, in his opinion, Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s assumptions in his model that that first officers would remain first officers and a high proportion of first officers would be over the age of 60 are not necessarily valid, given the variant ages at hiring and other factors affecting promotions.\n[416] Professor Kesselman said that the pilots at the top of the seniority in each classification are not necessarily the ones that will be over 60. Seniority is by years of service at Air Canada; pilots may be hired at different ages and therefore there could be some individuals with higher seniority but lesser age and vice versa. Rather, said Professor Kesselman, more first officers will tend to be younger and over time without mandatory retirement, it would be easier to satisfy the over\/under rule.\n[417] Mr. Tarapasky's model requires much higher percentages of FOs being over age 60, in most cases 30%, 40% or even 50% before it runs into this gridlock, where it can't do the matching, can't satisfy the over\/under rule.\n[418] Mr. Salamat pointed out in his evidence that there is a strong correlation between age and seniority. But Mr. Salamat said, that this does not always hold true. You can be old and be at the top of the seniority list and you can be old and be at the middle or bottom of the seniority list. You just can\u2019t be young and senior. Consider the example of FO George Vilven who retired from Air Canada at age 60 with only 22 years of service and seniority number 1,404 putting him in the middle of the seniority list.\n[419] Captain Duke identified one weakness with Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s model. He said that it is only one month\u2019s data. If it was a year\u2019s worth of data, it might be that PBS could produce a solution on the B777 with 80% captains and 30% first officers. I agree that this evidence is reflective of only one month\u2019s operations and may not be representative of a whole year or any future period.\n[420] Finally, there is the evidence of the age distribution and the level of seniority of Air Canada pilots in 2009 contained in the reports of Mr. Salamat and Captain Duke. For example, as set out in great detail earlier in this decision, Mr. Salamat\u2019s, Equipment Bid 09-01 Age at Bid Close, shows that the age range for Vancouver B777 FO is between age 41.8 and age 58.7. Of the 76 pilots in this position in 2009, the average age and median age was about 54 and 52 years.\n[421] Captain Duke\u2019s chart (p. 60) shows that of the current Vancouver B777 FOs, only 26% are age 55 or older. Another of his charts (p.10\/12) indicates that the highest number of Toronto B777 FOs are concentrated at the 1,000-1,400 seniority level which is in middle of the seniority pack. And by far only a very few FOs on this equipment are at the highest seniority level. For the Toronto A330 FOs, the highest concentration in numbers is at the 1,600-1,800 seniority level.\n[422] Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s conclusions may be valid in its own terms. But it is a snapshot only for one month and depends on the assumption that the wide-bodied FOs are the most senior and the oldest and that for each combination percentage of CAs and FOs combination they are all potentially restricted, i.e. over age 60.\n[423] The demographic evidence is otherwise. These FOs are not the most senior and are not the oldest pilots on the wide-bodied aircraft. Maybe in the future this could be the situation. But that is only speculation.\n[424] Captain Duke\u2019s evidence on cost impact depends on Mr. Tarapasky\u2019s conclusions that PBS could not produce a solution for the actual blocks run if mandatory retirement is ended. To this extent his conclusions on the additional cost to Air Canada cannot be accepted.\n[425] At the end of it all, my opinion is that Air Canada has not met the burden of proving that it will suffer undue hardship with the elimination of the age 60 retirement rule. Accordingly, it cannot rely on the BFOR defence under s. 15(1)(a) of the CHRA.\nII. Final Conclusion [426] I have concluded that the Respondents can rely on s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA so that the mandatory retirement policy at age 60 does not amount to a discriminatory practice. Accordingly, the complaints are dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

International longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2011-09-09\nNeutral citation\n2011 CHRT 12\nFile number(s)\nT1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nDecision type\nRuling\nDecision Content\nRULING ON DISCLOSURE\n[1] On March 6, 2009, Leslie Palm filed five separate complaints of discrimination, alleged to have occurred in February and March 2008, against British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (\u201cBCMEA\u201d) and Western Stevedoring Ltd (\u201cWestern\u201d) (together, the \u201cEmployer Respondents\u201d), Local 500 of the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (the \u201cUnion\u201d), Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome (together, the \u201cRemaining Respondents\u201d).\n[2] Pursuant to section 47 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) appointed a conciliator in an attempt to bring about a settlement of the complaints. On January 7, 2011, Ms. Palm agreed to settle with two of the five respondents, the BCMEA (claim numbered 2008 1276), and Western (claim numbered 2008 1277). Pursuant to section 48 of the CHRA, the settlement agreements (collectively, the \u201cSettlement\u201d) were referred to and approved by the Commission.\n[3] On June 14, 2011, the Remaining Respondents applied for disclosure of the minutes of the Settlement, claiming that the Settlement is not privileged and that its terms are relevant to the complaints against them.\n[4] Ms. Palm, who is not represented by counsel, opposes any disclosure of the Settlement.\n[5] The Employer Respondents accept that there should be disclosure of the Settlement terms relating to damages for lost wages or expenses, and releases of liability of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Willicome. They argue that this disclosure should be made to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) only, and not to the Remaining Respondents. The Employer Respondents oppose any disclosure of the Settlement terms relating to non-pecuniary damages and any provisions relating to systemic remedies.\n[6] The Commission opposes disclosure of the Settlement, but argues in the alternative that if disclosure is ordered, it should be restricted to the Settlement terms relevant to the issues of lost wages and expenses, and releases of liability of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Willicome. The Commission argues that the Settlement is not relevant to non-pecuniary damages and systemic remedies. If disclosure is ordered, the Commission suggests that the \u201cO\u2019Connor\u201d procedure should be adopted, by which disclosure is made to the Tribunal, who then determines what, if anything, must be produced to the Remaining Respondents.\n[7] Careful scrutiny of the five complaints reveals that they are grounded in a two-month period of turmoil at the Vancouver harbour Lynn Terminal East operation of Western. It is not a situation giving rise to discrete allegations of discriminatory conduct engaged in by disconnected respondents. Rather, when viewed together, the complaints portray a work environment with a long and ingrained history of hostility to women.\n[8] While the complaints are not identical, they are strikingly similar. For example, each complaint includes specific reference to a report of Vince Ready filed with the Union on January 21, 2009 (the \u201cReady Report\u201d). Mr. Ready was commissioned by the Union to do a study of discrimination on the waterfront, and relied mainly on confidential interviews with members of the Union and their narrative accounts of experiences on the waterfront. The Employer Respondents did not participate.\n[9] There are other similarities, as illustrated, for example, in the following extracts from the complaints against Western and the Union:\nWestern: \u201cWestern \u2026has discriminated against Ms. Palm on the basis of her sex during her employment at Western, and in particular during the months of February and March of 2008, Western also failed to mitigate in any manner the discriminatory action and gender based harassing behaviours of its male employees directed against Ms. Palm during the months of February and March, 2008.\u201d\nUnion: \u201cILWU Local 500 \u2026has discriminated against Ms. Palm and harassed Ms. Palm on the basis of her sex for the duration of her membership in Local 500, and in particular during the months of February and March of 2008 when she was employed by Western Stevedoring Ltd \u2026and in a subsequent investigation of discriminatory conduct that occurred at Western conducted by the B.C. Maritime Employers Association \u2026 Local 500 also failed to mitigate in any manner the discriminatory action and sex based harassing behaviours of its male members directed against Ms. Palm during the months of February and March, 2008.\u201d\n\u201cWestern\u2019s Hostile Work Environment:\n\u201c\u2026The work environment at Western is directly hostile to women and fosters a culture in which it is acceptable to belittle and undervalue the presence, work product and standing of women as equal parties in the work force because they are women.\nA January 2009 report by Vince Ready on Vancouver longshore work environment discrimination against women castigates all parties, including Western, involved in waterfront employment as discriminating against women and creating a female hostile culture. Specific matters that contribute to an environment that systematically discriminates against women include:\u2026\u201d (The complaint goes on to list 11 such matters from the Ready report).\n\u201cHostile Union Work Environment\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 the environment in Local 500 is directly hostile to women and fosters a culture in which it is acceptable to belittle and undervalue the presence, work product and standing of women as equal parties in the work force, and as members of the union, because they are women.\nA January 2009 report by Vince Ready on Vancouver longshore work environment discrimination against women castigates all parties, including local 500, involved in waterfront employment as discriminating against women and creating a female hostile culture. Specific matters that contribute to an environment that systematically discriminates against women include\u2026\u201d (the complaint goes on to list 10 matters from the Ready report, which are virtually identical to those listed in the complaint against Western).\n[10] On June 15, 2009, the executive of the Union adopted the Ready Report and recommendations, two of which are relevant to this proceeding:\n\u201c\u2026that the Union and the Employer develop an adapted grievance procedure to address grievances, which include alleged breaches of the Human Rights Act; and\n\u201c\u2026that the Union seek to amend the Collective Agreement to reflect its position regarding the elimination of harassment and discrimination.\u201d\nIt is noteworthy that Mr. Ready prefaced his recommendations as follows:\n\u201cBefore delving into my recommendations, I also feel compelled to observe that the overall approach to curing the current atmosphere on the Vancouver Waterfront ought to be a joint process with the Employer. I make this observation regardless of the fact that it is the Employer that has the legal obligation to provide a workplace free from harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n[11] The Remaining Respondents\u2019 motion for disclosure sets out the following summary of facts:\nMs. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Employer Respondents and the Remaining Respondents were all filed on March 6, 2009 and are in large measure the same. The BCMEA owns and operates the Vancouver Despatch Hall through which Union members and casual employees aspiring to Union membership acquire work. The majority of jobs are staffed as a result of daily dispatch, but under the collective agreement a company may request a worker on a regular work force (RWF) basis. The worker then reports directly to that company for one year. At the relevant times, Ms. Palm, Mr. Wellicome and Mr Wilkinson were RWF employees at Western Stevedoring, a member company of the BCMEA. Ms. Palm and her partner Mr. Russo were the two steel drivers. Mr Wellicome and Mr Wilkinson and ten others were pulp drivers. The steel drivers\u2019 shift began an hour earlier than the regular hours of work so they typically received an hour of overtime each weekday. The assignment of weekend overtime work was based on the number of hours the employee had worked that week \u2013 the worker with the lowest number of hours during the week was the first person assigned to weekend overtime. In or around February of 2008 a controversy between steel drivers and pulp drivers developed over access to overtime work. This was the result of work slowing down on the docks due to the economic downturn. The steel drivers stopped getting as many early starts and were thus higher on the list for weekend work. Since less weekend work was available, some pulp drivers were not called in and yet Ms. Palm or Mr. Russo were called. At several meetings of the RWF there were heated discussions regarding the overtime allocation system. Ms. Palm\u2019s complaint concerns this time period. On May 28, 2008 Ms. Palm wrote a letter to Western Stevedoring\u2019s Health and Safety Administrator alleging harassment by her co-workers. There was no allegation of gender discrimination or that the alleged harassment was related to gender. Western Stevedoring undertook an investigation into Ms. Palm\u2019s complaint. On September 2, 2008 the BCMEA provided a final report on the harassment complaint investigation to the Union. The investigation found that Mr. Wilkinson had incorrectly recorded Ms. Palm\u2019s hours; that Mr. Wellicome told Ms. Palm to \u201cfuck off\u201d; that some RWF pulp drivers exerted a significant amount of pressure on Ms. Palm and any other driver that did not agree with them, but that there was \u201cno evidence or allegation that this conduct was discriminatory as it was not based on any of the prohibited grounds.\u201d Western Stevedoring wrote a letter of reprimand to Mr. Wellicome for his conduct towards Ms. Palm.\n[12] The Remaining Respondents assert that because there is a commonality of circumstances in Ms. Palm\u2019s five complaints, the terms of the Settlement with the Employer Respondents are arguably relevant in the case against them, and ought not to be afforded confidentiality, citing Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 5, and Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Quebec Inc. v. Barbe, 2003 CHRT 15.\n[13] The Commission argues that the Settlement is privileged and disclosure cannot be compelled, citing, among other authorities, section 47(3) of the CHRA. Based on the decision in Barbe, I am satisfied that section 47(3) of the CHRA does not prohibit disclosure of the Settlement itself.\n[14] The Employer Respondents maintain that two decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal more appropriately express the rule of settlement privilege, and argue that the general rule set out in British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital v. Air Products Canada Ltd 2003 B.J.C. No 591 (CA) (\u201cBritish Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital\u201d) and Dos Santos (Committee of) v. Sun Life Assurance of Canada 2005 BCCA 4 (\u201cDos Santos\u201d) is that settlement agreements are privileged and should not be disclosed unless they are both relevant and necessary in the circumstances of the case to achieve the overriding interests of justice.\n[15] The Dos Santos decision affirms that there can be exceptions to the blanket privilege for settlement communications, and sets out the test for establishing such an exception:\n\u201cHowever, the test for discharging the burden to establish an exception should not be too low. The public policy behind settlement privilege is a compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception: Unilever, supra at p. 2449-2450.\nTo establish an exception in this case, the defendant must show that a competing public interest outweighs the public interest in encouraging settlement. An exception should only be found where the documents sought are both relevant, and necessary in the circumstances of the case to achieve either the agreement of the parties to the settlement, or another compelling or overriding interest of justice.\u201d (emphasis added)\n[16] In Dos Santos, Chief Justice Finch went on to conclude that the only way to establish objectively what the plaintiff had actually received in compensation for lost earnings was to recognize an exception for the settlement documents that would otherwise have been protected by settlement privilege:\n\u201cBoth the relevance and necessity of the documents therefore militate in favour of recognizing an exception.\nI have also considered whether recognizing an exception in this case would place a chill on settlement negotiations. I do not believe it would. As in other cases where settlement agreements may have a direct effect on the rights and responsibilities of third parties, the parties to that agreement must be mindful that the confidential nature of their agreement will not be upheld so far as it affect those other parties. \u2026\u201d\nThe Chambers judge did not err in holding there was not settlement privilege over the sought documents. An exception to privilege exists in this case.\u201d\nRULING\n[17] I find that the Remaining Respondents have satisfied the test in Dos Santos. Given the striking similarities and interconnectedness of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints, I find that the terms of the Settlement are relevant to the complaints against the Remaining Respondents, and necessary to allow the Remaining Respondents to properly prepare their responses to Ms. Palm\u2019s claims, and for the Tribunal to make a just decision on the claims, should they proceed to hearing. The Settlement terms relating to releases of liability may directly affect the outcome of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Willicome. I find that the Settlement terms relating to both lost wages and non-pecuniary damages are relevant and necessary to guard against the possibility of double recovery with regard to the former, and to allow for some proportionality among these interconnected claims with regard to the latter.\n[18] It is clear from the material before me, in particular the excerpted portions of the Ready Report, that systemic discrimination against women on the waterfront is a serious and long-standing problem. Further, as Mr. Ready points out in his report, any solution to the problem must involve both the employer and the union. Any terms of Settlement relating to Ms. Palm\u2019s complaint of systemic discrimination are both relevant and necessary to achieve a just result in these circumstances.\n[19] The public interest in a fair and judicious disposition of these complaints outweighs the competing public interest in encouraging settlements achieved through blanket confidentiality.\nORDER\n[20] I order disclosure of the Settlement to the Remaining Respondents, such disclosure to be made in the following manner:\n(a) Within fourteen days after the release of this ruling, Harris & Company, lawyers for the Employer Respondents, shall provide a copy of the Settlement to Caroline & Gislason, lawyers for the Remaining Respondents;\n(b) Neither Caroline & Gislason nor the Remaining Respondents shall use the copy of the Settlement for any purpose other than the hearing or settlement of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents;\n(c) Caroline & Gislason shall be permitted to communicate the terms of the Settlement orally to the Remaining Respondents. Caroline & Gislason shall not make copies of the copy of the Settlement, and neither Caroline &Gislason nor the Remaining Respondents shall communicate the terms of the Settlement to anyone, other than in the course of the hearing or settlement of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents; and\n(d) Caroline & Gislason shall return the copy of the Settlement to Harris & Company within seven days of the determination of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents.\nThis ruling and order relate only to the question of the production of the Settlement. Its ultimate admissibility will have to be determined by the member hearing the case.\n",

Summary [1] Health Canada conducts medical assessments of Canadian International Development Agency employees seeking postings in other countries. Health Canada has developed medical evaluation guidelines specific to the assessment of employees seeking a posting in Afghanistan. Pursuant to these Afghanistan Guidelines, under the heading \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d, employees do not meet the medical requirements for posting if they have a medical condition that would likely lead to a life-threatening medical emergency if access to prescribed medication and\/or other treatment is interrupted for a short period of time. On this basis, the complainant alleges that her employer, the Canadian International Development Agency, engaged in a discriminatory practice when it decided that she was not suitable for a job posting in Afghanistan due to the fact that she had a condition of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The complainant also alleges that Health Canada engaged in a discriminatory practice when it recommended to her employer, Canadian International Development Agency that she not be posted to Afghanistan because of her diabetic condition. She also alleges that her employer did not use its discretionary power to decide not to follow Health Canada\u2019s recommendation.\n[2] The Afghanistan Guidelines do not reflect equality between all members of society. Although the guidelines are meant to be instructive and informative, their wording suggests mandatory medical requirements without consideration of the individualized circumstances of each person. The process by which Health Canada assessed and arrived at its recommendation, influenced as it was by the Afghanistan Guidelines, failed to consider the inherent worth and dignity of the complainant. The application of these guidelines to the complainant resulted in her being discriminated against in the course of her medical assessment. Health Canada did not provide sufficient evidence that its conduct was non-discriminatory. Therefore, the complainant suffered adverse differentiation on the basis of her disability by the wording and application of the Afghanistan Guidelines by Health Canada.\n[3] The evidence indicates that it would pose an undue hardship for the Canadian International Development Agency to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan. There are serious health and safety risks present for Canadians working in Afghanistan and these risks frequently materialize. It is not only the complainant who bears these risks, but also members of the Canadian Forces and other foreign military personnel. Evidence was lead that the recommendations made by the third independent endocrinologist who assessed the complainant, to accommodate her in Afghanistan could not be enforced at all times and could likely result in putting herself and other CIDA employees in danger. Medical services and facilities are limited including bed space, and therefore, must be preserved for the treatment of troops, injured Afghani civilians and unpredictable emergencies that impact all civilians posted in Afghanistan. In the requirements to accomplish the mission in Afghanistan, pre-deployment screening and medical assessments of employees is warranted and the high standard for safety reasons is justifiable but, should be made in accordance with human rights principles and, on a case by case, individualized approach. Furthermore, Canadian International Development Agency has breached its duty to explore all reasonable accommodation measures for the complainant. It had a duty to obtain all relevant information about its employee\u2019s disability and seriously consider how the complainant could be accommodated. It did not lead sufficient evidence that had explored all reasonable accommodation measures.\n[4] Therefore, both complaints are substantiated under section 7 (b) of the CHRA against Health Canada and under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA against CIDA; and the Tribunal orders appropriate remedial action to eliminate these discriminatory practices.\nII. Background and Complaints [5] There is a war in Afghanistan. Combat is continuous, complex and dangerous. At the time of these complaints, Canada was one of 41 countries participating in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led formation that operates in Afghanistan under the authority of the United Nations (UN).[1] The UN also operates the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), a political mission established at the request of the Government of Afghanistan to assist it and the people of Afghanistan in laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development[2]. The Political Affairs Division at UNAMA supports political outreach, conflict resolution, disarmament and regional cooperation. The political mandate of UNAMA supported the implementation of the institutional and political objectives of the Bonn Agreement, signed in November 2001, as well as a range of peace-building tasks[3].\n[6] Canada has maintained a presence in Afghanistan since 2001. Canada has participated at many levels in the peacekeeping, security and reconstruction efforts within the country. The situation in Afghanistan calls for strong international cooperation. This international cooperation comes from both military personnel and civilian personnel as reconstruction efforts are often overseen by both military and civilian organizations. At the time of these complaints, all Canadian civilians serving in Kandahar performed their duties under the direction of the Representative of Canada in Kandahar (RoCk), who works under the leadership of the Canadian Ambassador in Kabul.[4] In Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is the principal organization responsible for providing aid to developing countries. CIDA\u2019s mandate is to manage Canada\u2019s support, aid and resources to developing countries such as Afghanistan.\n[7] This is part of the context in which the events giving rise to the present complaints occurred. The complainant, Ms. Bronwyn Cruden, filed two complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on November 8, 2008. First, the complaint alleges that her employer, CIDA, engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA) when it decided that she was not suitable for a job posting in Afghanistan due to her condition of type 1 diabetes. The second complaint alleged that Health Canada (HC) engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA when it recommended to CIDA that she not be posted to Afghanistan because of her diabetic condition. The complaint against HC was subsequently amended at the hearing, by consent of the parties, to include sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. On March 18, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the CHRA, the Commission requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) inquire into both complaints. The complaints were consolidated as they involve substantially the same issues of fact and law. The Commission participated at the hearing that took place from January 26 to February 4, 2011, representing the public interest in the proceedings.\nIII. Facts [8] After carefully reviewing all the evidence provided by the parties including the Agreed Statement of facts my findings of fact are the following:\nThe complainant is a CIDA employee who currently works at their Gatineau headquarters. From approximately August 6, 2007 to September 7, 2007 the complainant was on temporary duty assignment at the Canadian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. She was not subjected to a pre-deployment medical assessment prior to departure, as at that time, CIDA\u2019s policy did not require a medical assessment of employees being posted for less than one year.\n[9] In January 2008, the complainant applied for a number of one year postings in Afghanistan that CIDA was to make available in the near future. She applied for the position of \"Director of Kandahar\" and for other development officer positions.\n[10] On January 20, 2008, the complainant was deployed a second time to Afghanistan, this time in Kandahar, as part of the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). This deployment was to last until February 25, 2008.\n[11] During the early morning of February 11, 2008, the complainant had a hypoglycaemic \u201cincident\u201d while she was sleeping. A co-worker in the adjoining room overheard her making noises and movements in her sleep, tried to wake her up and when she wasn\u2019t successful, called a Canadian Forces Medical Officer, who administrated intravenous glucose to the complainant. The complainant was subsequently released after treatment. Later on that day, the complainant was referred to an internal medicine consultant at the Kandahar Airfield (KAF) who strongly recommended that the complainant be repatriated to Canada. The complainant disagreed with the internal medicine consultant\u2019s recommendation and wished to stay on in Afghanistan to complete her temporary duty assignment. CIDA chose to end the complainant\u2019s temporary duty assignment and promptly returned her to Canada.\n[12] On February 13, 2008, Michael Collins (Director, Management Services CIDA) sent an email to the complainant and some of her colleagues within the Afghanistan Task Force (ATF) to seek if they were interested in field postings in Afghanistan. Everyone who received this email has since been posted to Afghanistan except the complainant.\n[13] Upon her return to Canada, the complainant obtained a letter of support from her treating endocrinologist, Dr. Amel Arnaout. The letter dated February 21, 2008, supports the complainant\u2019s efforts to return to work in Afghanistan. Dr. Arnaout explains that the complainant was assessed on February 18 2008, and that she \"is mentally and physically capable of continuing her work in Afghanistan...\u2019\u2019. By e-mail dated February 22, 2008, Marion Parry (Manager, Mobility and Career Programs, CIDA) requested that the complainant be medically assessed in order to ascertain whether or not she could continue her temporary duty assignment and to determine her fitness for posting due to her expressed interest in a formal one-year posting.\n[14] In an email dated February 26, 2008 to CIDA, Major Robin Thurlow (Canadian Expeditionary Force Command, JHSS) stated that he was concerned with the fact that no pre-deployment medical screening was conducted for persons deploying to Afghanistan for less than one year. He went on to request support in ensuring that screening be conducted for all personnel being sent to Afghanistan. CIDA subsequently changed its practices to require that all employees being sent to Afghanistan for any period of time undergo a pre-deployment medical screening.\n[15] Pursuant to Foreign Service Directive 9 Medical and Dental Examinations (FSD9) (see FSD9 at Appendix #1), which is published by the National Joint Council, HC conducts medical assessments of CIDA employees seeking postings in other countries. FSD9 also provides a process by which these assessments are to take place. Both HC and CIDA have to consider FSD9. In performing medical assessments, HC has developed and publishes the Occupational Health Assessment Guide (OHAG), which is intended to help guide the medical examiner in making an assessment (see section 1 of the OHAG at Appendix #2). Shortly after Major Thurlow\u2019s February 2008 email indicating that medical assessments should be done for all postings to Afghanistan, HC developed the Medical Evaluation Guidelines for Posting, Temporary Duty or Travel to Afghanistan (Hardship Post level 5 with Hostility Bonus) (the Afghanistan Guidelines) (see Afghanistan Guidelines at Appendix #3). Under the heading \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d, the Afghanistan Guidelines state:\nEmployees do not meet the medical requirements for assignment or posting: [..] If they have a medical condition that would likely lead to a life-threatening medical emergency if access to prescribed medication and\/or other treatment is interrupted for a short period of time.\n[16] On March 18, 2008, the complainant met with Dr. Maureen Peggy Baxter (Occupational Health Medical Officer (OHMO) with HC\u2019s Workplace Health and Public Safety Program WHPSP) Health Clinic (Clinic) to determine if the complainant was a suitable candidate for a position in Afghanistan. The complainant provided Dr. Baxter with past health records and a copy of Dr. Arnaout\u2019s letter dated February 21, 2008. Following this medical assessment, on April 9, 2008, Dr. Baxter consulted with some of her fellow OHMO at the Clinic. They unanimously agreed on a recommendation that the complainant was not medically fit to be posted to Kabul. Dr. Eva Callary and Dr. Lloyd-Jones were part of the discussion and did not seek an independent third opinion under s. 9.05(a) of FSD9 before reaching this decision. That same day, Dr. Baxter indicated by letter to Clement Bedard (Program Assistant, Assignments Management Centre, CIDA) that in light of the fact that the complainant\u2019s medical condition is chronic in nature and there was a risk of destabilization, she could not be recommended for deployment to Afghanistan because she required sophisticated care and treatment not available at this post. Dr. Baxter reported however, that Dr. Arnaout had submitted information indicating the complainant\u2019s current condition is stable. Dr. Baxter\u2019s letter was not sent to the complainant at that moment nor did HC advise her of their recommendation they made to CIDA.\n[17] Upon receipt of this recommendation from HC, CIDA decided that it would not send the complainant to Afghanistan and did not make further inquiries of Dr. Baxter or Dr. Arnaout or pursuant to s. 9.05 (b) of FSD9 to seek out an independent third medical opinion.\n[18] On April 10, 2008, the complainant received a letter from Ms. Parry informing her that she had not been selected for the position of \u201cDirector Kandahar\u201d. Ms. Parry did not inform the complainant on the outcome of the other applications for development officers\u2019 postings to which she had also applied.\n[19] Around April 15 or 16, 2008, the complainant had a conversation with Michael Collins who told her that HC had recommended against returning or posting her to Afghanistan.\n[20] The complainant attempted to gather information from HC. The complainant and Dr. Baxter exchanged emails and had a telephone conversation. On April 17, 2008, the complainant learned from Dr. Baxter that while HC had the responsibility to provide recommendations based on health assessments, all decisions concerning the deployment of employees rested with CIDA. The complainant forwarded Dr. Baxter\u2019s email to Michael Collins (Director, Management Services, CIDA) and asked if it would exercise its discretion to allow her to go to Afghanistan. No one from CIDA replied to this email. On April 21, 2008, the complainant wrote to Dr. Baxter to ask if HC would provide a list of countries to which it would not recommend for posting. On April 23, 2008, Dr. Baxter wrote back to say that such a list did not exist and that in general, higher hardship levels are less likely to have suitable medical services available and suggested the complainant short list some of the countries she was interested in, and ask her department to send a fitness request.\n[21] On June 2, 2008, the complainant wrote and questioned Danica Shimbashi (Director General, Human Resources, CIDA) in order to find out if there had ever been a situation where CIDA did not follow a HC recommendation in the past. The complainant also asked if CIDA would ask for an advance fitness assessment for its postings.\n[22] On June 20, 2008, as a response, Ms. Parry who had received the request forwarded from Ms. Shimbashi to her, replied to the complainant directly and advised her that HC is the only occupational health body responsible for medical assessments. Ms. Parry said she must advise management to be guided at all times by HC\u2019s determination since CIDA\u2019s human resources staff and managers are not in any position to re-evaluate a medical opinion. Furthermore, CIDA informed the complainant that HC\u2019s medical assessments were only valid for a period of six months being post-specific and that CIDA could not authorize evaluations now for possible future postings. Ms. Parry suggested to the complainant to follow-up with Dr. Baxter to see which levels of hardship could reasonably be expected to have the necessary medical capacity to respond to her health condition.\n[23] On August 26, 2008, Mr. Wallace, from CIDA, wrote a letter to the complainant saying that HC had indicated a willingness to review countries where posting may be possible with her condition and that she could contact Dr. Eva Callary (Medical officer in charge, Occupational Health Clinic, WHPSP, HC) in this regard.\n[24] On September 25, 2008, the complainant met with Dr. Eva Callary and she provided a list of 19 countries that were expected to have postings for 2009 to the complainant. During this meeting, Dr. Callary informed the complainant that it was possible to request an internal review of her circumstances with HC\u2019s Medical Advisory Committee (HC-MAC) this was the first time the complainant was made aware of such a possibility.\n[25] On October 3, 2008, Dr. Callary, via email, assured the complainant that HC would respect the decision of the HC-MAC whatever it may be.\n[26] On November 28, 2008, Dr. Baxter responded to the complainant concerning the list of 19 countries that Dr. Callary provided previously. HC found that of the 19 countries, 5 were considered suitable, 5 were considered unsuitable, and 3 were listed as \u201cmissions with concerns\u201d which would require individual assessment. For the remaining six missions, Dr. Baxter said that insufficient information had been received from the responsible regional medical officers and that an addendum would follow when it received further information. No further addendum was delivered.\n[27] The same day, Dr. Arnaout wrote a letter of assessment for the complainant and stated she considered the complainant being optimally managed in her diabetes and hoped this letter would help in her appeal process concerning postings in Afghanistan. The complainant sent a written submission to the HC-MAC to review her medical situation.\n[28] On January 16, 2009 the HC-MAC rendered its recommendation and sent a letter to Dr. Baxter to this effect. It asked the complainant to undergo a medical examination with an independent medical endocrinologist, including a review of her history, clinical status and detailed reports on medical conditions in Afghanistan. The HC-MAC further said that if the independent medical endocrinologist was of the opinion that a posting to Afghanistan was not at risk to her or others that it would sign off on her case as meeting the medical requirements for this posting. However, if the independent medical endocrinologist was of the opinion that the posting was medically inadvisable, the original recommendation would stand. Dr. Baxter sent a copy of the HC-MAC decision to the complainant on January 30, 2009.\n[29] On February 15, 2009, the complainant informed HC that she would be willing to go through the medical exam towards midsummer 2009.\n[30] On September 22, 2009 the complainant was examined by Dr. Hugues Beauregard, an independent endocrinologist in Montreal selected by an outside company (Compremed Canada Inc.). Dr. Joanne Lloyd-Jones (OHMO, HC) had sent Dr. Beauregard the complainant\u2019s history, described the available medical facilities in Afghanistan, and identified the questions that HC wanted Dr. Beauregard to answer. In his preliminary report dated September 23, 2009, Dr. Beauregard considered the complainant capable to adapt to harsh working conditions and considering her knowledge in the management of her diabetes, she should be given permission to accept a posting to Afghanistan. In his report dated September 29, 2009, Dr. Beauregard, classified the complainant as a well informed, organized and a motivated patient. According to Dr. Beauregard, the complainant faced exposure to health risks slightly more elevated than non-diabetics even though she effectively managed her condition of type 1 diabetes. Dr. Beauregard was of the opinion that the complainant was fit for deployment to Afghanistan due to the fact that the health risks could be reduced to, what he termed as, an \u2018acceptable level\u2019 so long as she could bring the equipment she needed, she was fit to work without restrictions at Kabul, KAF, PRT. Pursuant to Dr. Beauregard\u2019s suggestion, the complainant underwent a cardiac stress test and a psychological assessment, to examine her capacity to handle stress associated with conflict zones. She was deemed psychologically fit for full-time work and eventual Afghanistan posting. The complainant gave copies of Dr. Beauregard\u2019s report to various CIDA officials in October 2009, including her immediate supervisor Dave Metcalfe and Amy Baker (Chief of Staff, President\u2019s Office, CIDA) and Joanne Marquis (Human Resources, CIDA).\n[31] On November 5, 2009, HC asked Dr. Beauregard to clarify the content of his medical report taking into consideration the current Afghanistan Guidelines. Dr. Lloyd-Jones, wrote to Clement Bedard letting him know she had received information from Dr. Beauregard but was seeking clarification.\n[32] On November 19, 2009, Dr. Beauregard responded to Dr. Lloyd-Jones\u2019s request for clarification. He wrote that the complainant would be deemed unfit by HC\u2019s \"absolute medical requirement\" that no employee \"...have a medical condition that would likely lead to a life-threatening medical emergency if access to prescribed medication and\/or other treatment is interrupted for a short period of time\" (see Afghanistan Guidelines at Appendix #3). However, Dr. Beauregard remained of the view that the complainant could still be deployed since she could manage her diabetes in the prevailing conditions in order to bring any risk within acceptable levels.\n[33] The same day, Dr. Lloyd-Jones wrote again to Mr. Bedard. In her letter, she stated that Dr. Beauregard had concluded that the complainant should be allowed to go to Kabul, the KAF or PRT in Kandahar. Dr. Lloyd-Jones indicated that his recommendation would change if he were to follow the wording contained in the Current HC Afghanistan guidelines.\n[34] Dr. Lloyd-Jones also asked Dr. Beauregard for clarification concerning implications for travel to remote areas. On November 24, 2009, Dr. Beauregard clarified that the risk of traveling was acceptable, so long as the complainant could have extra food and insulin to carry with her. Dr. Beauregard concluded saying he could not comment on the risks inherent to the political instability in the area. Dr. Lloyd-Jones passed this information on to Mr. Bedard in a letter dated December 7, 2009.\n[35] On December 9, 2009, France Genest (Director, Human Ressources Operations, CIDA) wrote a letter to Dr. Lloyd-Jones in which she asked her to confirm CIDA\u2019s understanding that HC\u2019s initial recommendation remained unchanged and if a further medical assessment would be required in connection with the complainant\u2019s application to be posted to Afghanistan as part of the 2010 assignment exercise.\n[36] On December 16, 2009, Dr. Lloyd-Jones informed Ms. Genest that Dr. Beauregard concluded that the complainant did not meet the absolute medical requirements of the Afghanistan Guidelines. Dr. Lloyd-Jones added that Dr. Beauregard was of the view that the complainant could work and travel in Afghanistan, if she (i) has access to medication, testing equipment and backup supplies at all times, (ii) lives and sleep in a room with a person aware of her condition, and (iii) has extra food and medication for travel. She concluded in saying that the final decision whether or not to post the complainant was CIDA\u2019s decision so as the decision to seek another medical assessment in the absence of any compelling new medical factors.\n[37] On January 11, 2010 the complainant was informed by Bob Johnston (Director General of the Afghanistan Task Force CIDA) that, in light of the information it received from HC, no further consideration would be given to posting her to Afghanistan unless there was a change to her medical condition.\nIV. Type I Diabetes [38] The Complainant was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at age 10 and has undergone different treatments over the course of her life. Type 1 diabetes is a condition whereby the pancreas no longer produces insulin; as a result, the complainant is insulin-dependent. She must monitor her glucose levels and is on insulin therapy. The complainant often uses an insulin pump and a sensor to assist her in maintaining her blood sugar levels at normal range.\n[39] Insulin therapy is required for the survival of persons with type 1 diabetes. There are different kinds of insulin and also different methods for insulin intake. One option is to take insulin with a syringe or pen as required. Another option is to use an insulin pump, which is a portable, battery-operated, device that is programmed to deliver insulin 24 hours per day through a small catheter under the skin.\n[40] Regular monitoring of blood sugars is also required for persons with type 1 diabetes. The level of sugar in the blood can be affected by a number of factors, including the administration of insulin, food intake, physical exercise; stress levels and inter current illness. Persons with type 1 diabetes are at risk of short and long term complications, which can include kidney or renal disease (diabetic nephropathy), eye disease (diabetic retinopathy), nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy) or other end organ disease.\n[41] Individuals with type 1 diabetes are also at risk of suffering from hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia occurs when the blood sugar is too low. This occurs when the person with diabetes does not consume enough nourishment in a timely fashion or takes too much insulin, causing the sugar in the blood to be consumed more rapidly than anticipated. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia range from hunger, anxiety, shakiness, sweating, and irritability. If left untreated, symptoms may progress to confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures and possibly death. A person that experiences a severe hypoglycaemic reaction resulting in cognitive function deterioration, convulsion and coma would need help from a third party to help them ingest sugars, to provide an injection of glucagon (a hormone that increases the blood sugar level) or to administer intravenous glucose. Intravenous glucose cannot be administered by a person with no medical qualifications, for example, a qualified person to administer intravenous glucose would be a medical technician, a nurse or a doctor. However, anyone can receive training to give a glucagon injection. In certain instances, hypoglycaemic unawareness occurs whereby the early signs of hypoglycaemia go unnoticed or are absent. Severe hypoglycaemic events increase with age. Also, the more a person experiences them, the more vulnerable that person is to experiencing another severe hypoglycaemic event in the future.\n[42] Hyperglycaemia is another complication that can result from type 1 diabetes. It occurs when a person\u2019s blood sugar level becomes too high. Hyperglycaemia can be caused by numerous factors, including excessive consumption of food or sugar, infection, trauma, increased stress, and failing to take enough insulin in a timely fashion. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can include hunger, excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or fatigue. Most of the time a person will detect early symptoms of hyperglycaemia and correct the problem, for example, by taking insulin. If left untreated, hyperglycaemia can lead to an acute complication called diabetic ketoacidosis (\u201cDKA\u2019\u2019). DKA occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the body to break down fat cells for fuel, rather than convert sugar in the blood. This process releases waste products called ketones that can accumulate in the blood and affect the body\u2019s metabolism. Signs and symptoms of DKA can include fruity odour on the breath, confusion, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. DKA is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment, which includes administration of fluids and insulin and can require hospitalisation.\n[43] A severe hyperglycaemic or hypoglycaemic event can often be prevented by many means and by the use of an insulin pump and a sensor. The complainant has been outfitted with a system called the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS). The CGMS automatically checks blood glucose levels every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin. It can sound an alarm if levels are too high or too low. The CGMS is designed to interact with an insulin pump. An insulin pump replaces insulin injection therapy. The pump can administer insulin in two ways: (1) it injects a basal rate of insulin (a regular series of small doses); or, (2) it injects a bolus rate (an increased dose of insulin programmed when carbohydrates are to be consumed). It is possible to suspend or adjust the basal rate when needed. In the event the CGMS is not working, the person with type 1 diabetes will switch to needles and insulin. The CGMS is not a foolproof tool: it only helps with the surveillance and management of diabetic symptoms. While this tool may help diminish the risk of a hypoglycaemic event occurring, the use of it cannot guarantee that such an incident will not reoccur. In the event of such an incident, the complainant would need a glucagon injection. I find, the CGMS\u2019 use is not very well documented because no significant study has been performed on the subject.\n[44] The complainant has extensive knowledge of her condition and how to cope with it, even during her pregnancy (at the time of the hearing). She also possesses a good knowledge of her insulin pump and sensor and explained their functioning very clearly at the hearing. There are ways to prevent water, heat and sand, all current conditions in Afghanistan, from damaging the insulin pump. The complainant takes 12 readings a day of her blood sugar levels and notes them in a notepad. She is able to skip meals even with her condition because of the way she controls her blood sugar levels. The complainant keeps sugar tablets with her in case of a low blood sugar reaction. She also gave examples of other food intake she may use in the same situation. She lives alone and copes with the dangers of hypoglycaemia by herself. She has never had a severe hypoglycaemic event in her sleep while living in Ottawa. Since 2009, the complainant uses a sensor to sound an alarm that can wake her up if her blood sugar levels are too low. Whenever the complainant travels or works overseas, she keeps her insulin, needles and other materials with her in case she needs it.\nV. Facts in Dispute & Positions of the Parties A. Position of the Complainant [45] According to the complainant, CIDA and HC discriminated against her on the basis of her diabetic condition. As far as the complainant is concerned, her medical condition is in no way an obstacle to her career. During her stay in Afghanistan, the complainant travelled in an armoured vehicle and had her medical supplies with her at all times. The day following her hypoglycaemic event in Afghanistan, the complainant was well and did not need additional care. She reported for duty as usual. Prior to, and since her hypoglycaemic incident in Afghanistan she never required hospitalisation for her diabetes. Since this incident, the complainant affirms that she has taken preventative steps in order to ensure that such an incident does not reoccur in the future.\n[46] The complainant argues that the Afghanistan Guidelines place a blanket ban on all type 1 diabetics. This general prohibition does not take into account one diabetic\u2019s particular characteristics over another. The complainant argues that she manages her diabetes in a way that permits her to accomplish her tasks without putting her or third parties in danger. She is of the view that she requires only the same level of security available to all other CIDA employees deployed to Afghanistan and that a medical evacuation for complications related to her diabetes is very unlikely. Furthermore, the complainant asserts that no personnel from CIDA have ever been taken hostage while in Afghanistan.\n[47] The complainant contends that CIDA did not inform her of her rights and obligations when seeking accommodation. In this regard, CIDA\u2019s communications with her were not prompt and were often given after lengthy intervals. She claims that she was never provided with a copy of FSD9 or informed about HC\u2019s medical assessment process.\n[48] According to the complainant, CIDA must attempt to find ways to accommodate the complainant that would minimize any risk she may pose, to a reasonable level and, that CIDA only made a minimal attempt to remedy the situation. The complainant claims she attempted to work with CIDA to eliminate any perceived risks she may have posed by being posted to Afghanistan. The possibility of limiting all the complainants\u2019 functions to \u201cinside the wire\u201d which means Protective perimeter at Kandahar airfield was advanced, as was the recommendation that the complainant share a room with an individual cognizant of her condition and the treatment of it. Furthermore, the complainant argues that CIDA could have chosen to instruct its employees on how to administer glucagon injections. She was also willing to sign a waiver of liability in order to be able to be posted to Afghanistan.\n[49] The complainant claims that the impact of not being posted to Afghanistan was that she did not gain the field experience necessary for her career plan. Had the complainant received the posting in Afghanistan she feels confident that she would have received experience in managing programs, projects or issues in the area of international development. The complainant has applied for other competitions in CIDA in order to gain the field experience she feels she lost.\nB. Position of the Respondents [50] CIDA and HC filed a joint response to these complaints.\n[51] According to the respondents, accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan would cause undue hardship to the employer. Canada is at war in Afghanistan. Danger is everywhere and it is not possible for the complainant to be in control of her environment at all times. The medical facilities available in Afghanistan are ill equipped and overburdened. Medical evacuations are expensive and dangerous, as the helicopters used for these evacuations are often the target of enemy forces. Accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan poses an unacceptable level of risk to the complainant, to CIDA\u2019s operations and to the operations of the Canadian Armed Forces. Since the complainant has already suffered a hypoglycaemic incident in Afghanistan, the respondents consider their position to be reasonable.\n[52] CIDA contends that it attempted to accommodate the complainant by eliminating the travel requirement of her position. Moreover, a detailed list of appropriate countries for deployment based on the complainant\u2019s medical conditions was created and given to the complainant to help her with her career plans.\n[53] The respondents contend that medical screenings are necessary before deploying employees to foreign countries. In this case, the rationale for not sending individuals with chronic diseases to Afghanistan is risk minimization in an already unstable and risky environment. CIDA maintains that it does not have the expertise needed to pronounce themselves on health matters, which is why they rely on HC\u2019s recommendations. CIDA is not the only department that requires medical screening and recommendations from HC in order to deploy its employees. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) also relies on HC for recommendations before deployment. CIDA officials inquired to DFAIT if they had ever deployed an employee against a HC recommendation. DFAIT\u2019s response was that it was uncommon, and likely only occurred on two separate occasions.\nC. Position of the Commission [54] The Commission is of the view that HC\u2019s Afghanistan Guidelines can be interpreted as imposing a blanket ban on sending any person with type 1 diabetes to Afghanistan. The Commission also submits that CIDA may have interpreted the guidelines as imposing a blanket ban as it cited HC\u2019s recommendation and guidelines in deciding that it would not allow the complainant to work in Afghanistan.\n[55] The Commission argues that CIDA has not shown that it turned its minds to the possibility of finding ways, short of undue hardship, to bring any risks of accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan within tolerable levels. According to the Commission, since accommodative options in Afghanistan were not explored, the Afghanistan Guidelines cannot be justified.\n[56] The Commission submits that CIDA breached its procedural obligation to accommodate the complainant by failing to take active steps to obtain all the relevant medical information necessary to make a fair, individualized and comprehensive decision. In this regard, the respondents did not treat the complainant in a fair and transparent manner, or respect her needs for information and support.\nVI. Law & Analysis A. The Complaint against HC i. A complaint can be filed under section 7 of the CHRA in the circumstances of this case [57] The complaint against HC was originally filed pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA. By consent of the parties, the complaint was amended to include sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA as well. Given the unique relationship between the complainant and HC in this case, a question arises as to which of sections 5(b), 7(b) and\/or 10(a) of the CHRA provide jurisdiction for the Tribunal to consider a claim against HC in this case. Each of these sections will be examined in turn.\n[58] Section 5(b)\nSection 5(b) of the CHRA provides:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n...\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual.\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[59] In this section, the term \u201cservices\u201d has been interpreted as something of benefit, being \u201cheld out\u201d as a service (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170 at para. 31). The term \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d contemplates that the service being offered creates a public relationship between the service provider and the service user (Dreaver v. Pankiw, 2009 CHRT 8 at para. 30; and, Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571 at para. 69).\n[60] In this case, HC is not providing a service for the benefit of the complainant but, rather, is providing a service for the benefit of CIDA. CIDA does not have medical expertise and relies on HC\u2019s assessment to make its own decision. It is CIDA who requests the assessment from HC, not the employee. HC is not offering a service that is generally available to other members of the Canadian public.\n[61] In Panacci v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FC 114 [Panacci], the complainant was a Canada Border Services Agency mail inspector who suffered a number of ailments. The Treasury Board instituted its accommodations policy and HC was responsible for carrying out health capacity and limitations evaluations. The complainant made her complaints following an evaluation in which the doctors attributed her complaints to job satisfaction and recommended transfer to another division. On judicial review, one of the questions that the Federal Court had to deal with was which of sections 5, 7 or 10 of the CHRA could form the basis for the grant of jurisdiction for a discrimination claim against HC. With regards to section 5 of the CHRA, the Court stated:\nWhile public servants with disabilities may fall within a sector of the general public, it stretches the normal meaning of \"general public\" to include persons such as the Applicant, a public servant who is subject to a Health Canada review in relation to her employment needs -- a service not available to most other members of the Canadian public.\n(Panacci at para. 52)\n[62] Based on the above, I do not believe that a complaint can be made out against Health Canada on the basis of section 5 of the CHRA.\n[63] Section 7(b)\nSections 7(b) of the CHRA provides:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n...\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[64] Under section 7(b) of the CHRA, the focus of the inquiry is on adverse differential treatment that is work or job-related (see Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 12). There is authority to suggest that a broad and liberal interpretation of section 7 of the CHRA, consistent with the nature of human rights legislation (see CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at para. 24), leads to a conclusion that this section encompasses employment situations beyond the direct employer-employee relationship. In Fontaine v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. 288 (CHRT) [Fontaine], the Tribunal interpreted section 7 of the CHRA as follows:\nThere need not be an actual contract or a direct relationship between the two parties in question. In any event, the word \"indirectly\" in the Canadian Human Rights Act provision must be given some meaning and thus provides a further basis for the conclusion that there need not be a contractual nexus between C.P. and Mr. Fontaine so long as there exists a significant element of control over his employment.\nIn our view the nature of the inquiry should not be whether C.P. is actually Mr. Fontaine's employer as that would not end the matter. To come within the purview of Section 7, one merely has to show that the impugned conduct was by someone who had a considerable degree of control or influence over the actual employer and indirectly upon its employee.\n(Fontaine at paras. 30-31)\n[65] The Fontaine decision was upheld by the Federal Court on judicial review (Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1991] 1 F.C. 571 [Canadian Pacific]); however, in relation to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of section 7, the Federal Court stated that \u201c...the language used by the Tribunal may not be apt in all respects\u201d (Canadian Pacific at para. 11). Rather, the Federal Court preferred to interpret \u201cemploy\u201d, and its derivatives (employer, employment), to mean \u201cutilize\u201d and arrived at the same conclusion as the Tribunal. Although Canadian Pacific seems to narrow the interpretation of section 7 set out in Fontaine, the recent decision of the Federal Court in Panacci provides a fresh perspective on the interpretation of section 7 of the CHRA. As mentioned above, in the Panacci decision, the question on judicial review was whether a discrimination complaint could properly be made out under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA against HC on the basis of its health capacity and limitations evaluations, even though Canada Border Services Agency was the employer of the complainant. In this regard, the Court stated:\nWhile s. 10 raises the very issue of who is the \"employee\", the section could be read to encompass situations beyond the \"direct\" employer-employee relationship, e.g. Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1991] 1 F.C. 571 (C.A.), [1990] F.C.J. No. 1028. This is particularly the case where the Court is required to take a \"large and liberal\" approach in respect of a remedial statute.\nTherefore, it is not \"plain and obvious\" (as that test is described in Canada Post Corp. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) (re Canadian Postmasters and Assistants Assn.) [1997] F.C.J. No. 578 (T.D.), aff'd [1999] F.C.J. No. 705 (C.A.)) that ss. 7 and 10 could not apply to the Applicant's complaint. This would be a matter which should have been left to the Tribunal to determine assuming there had been some factual basis upon which to ground the operation of these sections.\n(Panacci at paras. 54-55)\n[66] Ultimately, the Court seems to indicate that the determination of which section applies involves the following analysis:\nThe real search is which department committed the discriminatory acts and which should be a \"party\" in order that remedial action can be ordered and be effective. It must be remembered that because the Act is directed at remedial action, the focus of the inquiry is what happened \"in the course of the complainant's employment\". (See Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84.). There was no question raised as to the Commission's true jurisdiction to deal with the Applicant's complaint. The question was which of at least three provisions form the basis for the grant of jurisdiction.\n(Panacci at para. 51)\n[67] Using the broad and liberal interpretation of section 7 as described by the Federal Court in Panacci, I find that this section finds application in this case. HC established a guideline and medical assessment practice that applied to the complainant \u201cin the course of her employment\u201d. The complainant claims that the guideline and medical assessment process adversely differentiated against her on the basis of her disability, a prohibited ground of discrimination. On this basis, there is a factual foundation upon which to ground the operation of section 7(b) of CHRA in a complaint against HC in this case.\n[68] Section 10(a)\nSection 10(a) of the CHRA provides:\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n...\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[69] Unlike section 7, in section 10 of the CHRA Parliament has specified that only employers, employee organizations or employer organizations can be held liable for discriminatory policies or practices. In Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, [1999] 1 F.C. 113 (F.C.A.) [Bell Canada], the Court found that the operating words of section 11(1) of the CHRA (\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer...\u201d) made \u201c...the employer alone liable for differences in wages with respect to work of equal value\u201d (Bell Canada at para. 56). The Court added:\nIt would fly in the face of the clear wording of the Act and the obvious intent of Parliament to find the unions equally liable either implicitly under section 11 or indirectly through sections such as section 10 for having participated in the establishment of different wages with respect to work of equal value.\n(Bell Canada at para. 56)\n[70] The interpretation of section 11(1) of the CHRA by the Court in Bell Canada is equally applicable to the interpretation of section 10 of the CHRA in this case. Only employers, employee organizations and employer organizations can be held liable under section 10 of the CHRA. Given that HC is not the complainant\u2019s employer in this case, there is no basis to found a complaint against HC under section 10(a) of the CHRA in the circumstances of this case.\nii. The complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination [71] The complainant in a proceeding before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28). It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complainant to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer\u2019s actions or decisions. (See Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 112 N.R. 395 (F.C.A.); and, Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569). However, allegations made by a complainant have to be credible in order to support a conclusion that a prima facie case exists (see Dhanjal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (1997), 139 FTR 37 (FC)). Once a prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the conduct did not occur as alleged or was non-discriminatory.\n[72] On February 11, 2008 when the \u201cincident\u201d occurred, the complainant was sent back home because the internal medical doctor recommended it was safer for her and for others that she not stayed in Afghanistan. Following this incident, the military was displeased by the fact that no medical screening was done before sending any civilians to Afghanistan on assignments of up to a one year period. This displeasure was communicated to CIDA in an email from Major Thurlow questioning why employees were not medically screened before being sent to a war zone if their posting was under a year. CIDA usually retains the services of HC to assess if employees are medically fit before sending them on a posting in Afghanistan or in other countries. HC modified the Afghanistan Guidelines, an annex to the OHAG, to include \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d, referred to by the complainant and the Commission as the \u201cblanket ban\u201d. According to the Afghanistan Guidelines, no one with a chronic medical condition is allowed to be posted to Afghanistan. The complainant lives with a condition, type 1 diabetes mellitus. Disability is included amongst the prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in section 3 of the CHRA, and is defined in section 25 as \u201cany previous or existing mental or physical disability\u201d. Being a physical disability, diabetes is encompassed by the definition of disability in the CHRA. When the complainant requested to go back to Afghanistan and started applying for postings and ultimately underwent the medical assessment process for posting, she was found to not meet the requirement for posting to Afghanistan by all HC doctors and the independent medical endocrinologist retained in the process. Although the independent medical specialist originally found that she could meet the requirements for posting with conditions, when confronted with HC\u2019s inquiry about the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d, he declared that the complainant did not meet the requirements. I find, on a prima facie basis, the complainant was adversely differentiated by HC\u2019s assessment process and guidelines on the ground of her disability according to section 7(b) of the CHRA.\niii. HC has not established that the conduct did not occur as alleged or was non-discriminatory [73] In the present case, the respondents\u2019 responsibilities in assessing the complainant are intertwined. CIDA requests that employees be medically \u201cfit for posting\u201d before an assignment for posting is confirmed and materialized. HC\u2019s recommendation plays a crucial role in the medical assessment process. Unless CIDA exercises its discretion not to follow HC\u2019s recommendation, CIDA\u2019s decision to post or not rests on the assessment and reasoning of HC. In this case, I find HC\u2019s medical recommendation was a determining factor in CIDA\u2019s decision not to post the complainant in Afghanistan.\n[74] After HC-MAC reviewed Dr. Baxter\u2019s assessment, it rendered its decision that a third medical opinion should be performed and that the opinion of this third independent endocrinologist would be accepted. HC informed the complainant of the HC-MAC\u2019s decision. When the opinion came back from the independent endocrinologist, Dr. Beauregard, that the complainant was deemed fit and, after receiving a positive result on her stress and psychological assessments, based on the assurances from HC that the independent medical examiner\u2019s opinion would be accepted; the complainant expected that she would be posted to Afghanistan. Rather than accepting the opinion, HC asked Dr. Beauregard twice for clarification insisting that he look at the Afghanistan Guidelines in his clarification process. In response to HC, Dr. Beauregard stated that if the requirements were to be interpreted as \u201cabsolutely no medical conditions\u2019\u2019 that had the potential to constitute a danger of death, then in that case, the complainant was not an ideal candidate for deployment. HC then recommended to CIDA that the complainant not be posted in Afghanistan.\n[75] The absolute medical requirements in the Afghanistan Guidelines were the determining factor in swaying the endocrinologist\u2019s opinion. He interpreted them as instituting a \u201cblanket ban\u201d, a description of the guidelines that I do not think came from the doctor himself (term used by the complainant and the commission), however, I do believe he understood the medical requirements as being absolute. The evidence showed that the interpretation of the \u201cabsolute medical requirements\u201d by Dr. Beauregard was not contested nor clarified by HC. In this regard, I find that there is a problem with the manner in which the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u2019\u2019 of the Afghanistan Guidelines, are worded and therefore are open to more than one interpretation.\n[76] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\nYet the standard, if it is to be justified under the human rights legislation, must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[...]\nEmployers designing workplace standards owe an obligation to be aware of both the differences between individuals, and differences that characterize groups of individuals. They must build conceptions of equality into workplace standards. By enacting human rights statutes and providing that they are applicable to the workplace, the legislatures have determined that the standards governing the performance of work should be designed to reflect all members of society, in so far as this is reasonably possible. Courts and tribunals must bear this in mind when confronted with a claim of employment-related discrimination. To the extent that a standard unnecessarily fails to reflect the differences among individuals, it runs afoul of the prohibitions contained in the various human rights statutes and must be replaced. The standard itself is required to provide for individual accommodation, if reasonably possible. A standard that allows for such accommodation may be only slightly different from the existing standard but it is a different standard nonetheless.\n(Meiorin at paras. 62, 68)\n[77] Although the guidelines are meant to be instructive and informative, their wording suggests mandatory medical requirements without consideration of the individualized circumstances of each person. While HC doctors might understand the informative nature of the guidelines, an independent doctor, as in this case, might interpret the Afghanistan Guidelines as mandatory or absolute. In fact, on cross-examination, one of the authors of the Afghanistan Guidelines established that it is more than probable that someone reading the guidelines will interpret the medical requirements contained therein as being absolutely necessary. The terminology used in the guideline suggests that no person with a chronic condition will be qualified for a posting in Afghanistan. As was the interpretation of Dr. Beauregard, the Afghanistan Guidelines do not indicate a consideration of what exactly the restrictions of the person\u2019s condition are and whether these restrictions can still fulfill the medical requirements for posting to Afghanistan. In order to advance human rights, human rights principles need to be considered in the process of developing policies and guidelines. Organizations need to insure that in writing policies or guidelines that they are written in accordance with human rights principles.\n[78] The process by which HC assessed and arrived at its recommendation, influenced as it was by the Afghanistan Guidelines, also failed to consider the inherent worth and dignity of the complainant. Section 2 of the CHRA provides that the purpose of the Act is to give effect to the equality rights of all individuals. The notion of equality means \u201c...a respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings whatever their colour, race, language, sex or religion\u201d (Warman v. Tremaine, 2007 CHRT 2 at para. 97). The inherent worth and dignity of every individual is also recognized in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217 A (III), U.N. Doc. A\/810 (1948) 71:\nWhereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,\n[79] Also, Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides:\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n[80] Furthermore, the Preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 19 December 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, arts. 9-14, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47, 6 I.L.M. 368 (entered into force 23 March 1976, accession by Canada 19 May 1976), states:\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant,\nConsidering that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,\nRecognizing that these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person,\n[81] Also the Covenant on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted on 13 December 2006 during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly by resolution A\/RES\/61\/106 signed by Canada on March 30th, 2007 and ratified by Canada on March 11, 2010, in its Preamble section h mentions:\n\u201cRecognizing also that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person,\u201d\n[82] Human dignity is harmed when \u201c...individuals and groups are marginalized, ignored, or devalued...\u201d (Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 at para. 53). HC\u2019s witness admitted at the hearing that it was an error to tell the complainant that they would respect the independent endocrinologist\u2019s opinion \"whatever it may be\". HC\u2019s witness testified that they found Dr. Beauregard biased because he did not consider all the information first handed to him and that he was influenced by the personal motivation of the patient to go to Afghanistan. Under oath, Dr. Beauregard testified that the complainant appeared to be a very competent employee and that he would certainly hire her if he was in the employers\u2019 position. He also presumed that if a kidnapping were to occur, the kidnappers would want to keep their hostage alive. Although I redirected Dr. Beauregard to testify on his area of expertise, these comments demonstrate that HC\u2019s concerns that Dr. Beauregard was biased were justified. I find what happened is that when the HC-MAC recommended a third opinion and made the statement that they would accept that opinion, this placed them in a difficult position when they considered the third opinion to be bias. Having said they would accept the third opinion, whatever it may be, the HC-MAC created expectations for the complainant. Although they chose to seek clarification when the opinion deemed her fit, they did not seek further clarification when the opinion was changed. As it was not part of their practice, HC did not call or attempt to meet with Dr. Beauregard to determine the basis of his opinion that the complainant was fit for posting or to explain the instructional nature of the Afghanistan Guidelines.\n[83] Furthermore, section 1 of the OHAG indicates:\nThe intention of the OHAG is to guide the examiner to reach decisions and not to provide a set of rigid standards. No manual or set of standards can replace judgment based on the examiner\u2019s knowledge of the individual, the job, and the circumstances under which the job will be carried out.\nThe standards contained in this guide are deliberately worded in such a way to require the exercise of sound medical expertise, considering the requirements of the job and current occupational health practice.\nWhen an individual is unable to meet the occupational health medical requirements of a given position as outlined in this guide, the employing department, to the point of undue hardship, undertake further medical testing and\/or other accommodation. As part of its duty to make every effort up to the point of undue hardship to make every effort up to the point of undue hardship to accommodate the individual. Consideration will be done in consultation with the regional HC OHMO.\n(Emphasis added)\n[84] The evidence indicates that although HC takes an active role in the updating of the medical assessment guidelines of the OHAG and, that they remain available for any consultation with the employer concerning the OHAG, accommodation measures or further medical testing, HC never clarified with CIDA that Dr. Beauregard\u2019s opinion was swayed when he interpreted the medical requirements found in the \u201cAfghanistan Guidelines to be \u201cabsolute\u201d. HC never explained to Dr. Beauregard that the intention of the OHAG is not to provide a set of rigid standards. HC simply accepted Dr. Beauregard\u2019s conclusion in the light of the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d and gave the information to CIDA. Even if Dr. Lloyd-Jones from HC gave Clement Bedard (Program Assistant Assignments management Center CIDA) both of Dr. Beauregard\u2019s opinions in its letter dated November 19, 2009, that the complainant could be posted if certain conditions are met and, the other opinion, that she might not be the ideal candidate in light of the absolute medical requirements; this does not suffice to show that HC acted in a non-discriminatory way. Context and information were missing in the transmission and communication of the medical assessments. On December 9, 2009, France Genest (Director, Human Resources, Operations, CIDA) writes a letter to Dr. Lloyd-Jones, to ask if her conclusions are correct that Dr. Baxter and Dr. Beauregard are of the same opinion, HC does nothing to clarify the nuance between the two. Dr. Baxter\u2019s assessment of the complainant did not include a consideration of the Afghanistan Guidelines. At the time of Dr. Baxter\u2019s assessment, the guidelines were in draft form and had not been implemented yet. Dr. Baxter\u2019s assessment led her to the conclusion that the complainant was not an ideal candidate for posting in Afghanistan. The respondents contend that Dr. Beauregard arrived at this same conclusion. However, only one assessment considered the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u2019\u2019 in the Afghanistan guidelines. Dr. Beauregard originally found the complainant fit for posting in Afghanistan with conditions. It was only in light of the absolute medical requirements of the Afghanistan Guidelines that Dr. Beauregard changed his recommendation and said that the complainant might not be the ideal candidate. Without the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines, Dr. Baxter\u2019s assessment is that the complainant should not be posted and Dr. Beauregard\u2019s assessment is that the complainant can be posted to Afghanistan with conditions. Knowing the fact that the final decision rests with CIDA, HC had to ensure the information was as accurate and complete as possible.\n[85] I find, the problem lies, in part, with the manner HC chose to deal with the doctor\u2019s perceived bias. Even though HC found Dr. Beauregard to be biased, they followed through on his recommendation that additional tests be performed. On one hand, they followed Dr. Beauregard\u2019s recommendation to test the complainant and, on the other hand, they questioned his judgement because they did not find him independent. When the test results ultimately were positive, HC was faced with a challenge because then again, it raised the complainant\u2019s expectations for posting.\n[86] Throughout the whole process the complainant\u2019s dignity was not preserved: false expectations were raised and the process was not timely on HC\u2019s end. Overall, it took over a year and a half from the point when the complainant asked CIDA to exercise its discretion and allow her to work in Afghanistan, through HC\u2019s medical assessment process, to CIDA\u2019s final determination that she could not be posted to Afghanistan. Although HC\u2019s doctors are busy, this does not explain the significant delay bearing in mind that these medical assessments are only valid for six months. The evidence also shows that a posting process usually starts in September of a certain year and that after the application period is closed, the next opportunity to apply for postings is in September of the following year. With the process being designed this way, it is unreasonable to require an individual to wait for months at a time to obtain medical information thus losing the opportunity to participate in a posting process.\n[87] Given the above, it is clear that the wording and application of the Afghanistan Guidelines is producing results that do not fit with its intent. It is important that human rights be reflected, not only in the contents of a policy or guideline, but in its communication and end result as well. The intention of a guideline or policy may be legitimate, but the manner in which it is expressed or applied may be deficient. With that in mind, monitoring the effects of that policy or guideline is important. Communicating a message and a direction through a policy or a guideline will have a better impact if it is not only well communicated, but also well monitored. Monitoring guidelines and policies and their effects is necessary, especially in the human rights context:\n\u201cMonitoring\u201d is the active collection, verification and immediate use of information to improve human rights protection.\n(Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Training Manual on Human Rights Monitoring, UN Doc. E.01.X1V.2 (2001) at pp. 3, 9)\n[88] It is important that once a guideline or policy is adopted that appropriate risk management processes are put in place to prevent other human rights violations and injustices. With the use of surveys and reports, a good risk management system will frequently assess the effect of a guideline or policy to ensure that the intent of the guideline or the policy is being fulfilled without violating any rights and\/or obligations. This monitoring and system to correct irregularities can help to correct any negative effects and can help improve the policy or guideline to better reflect its intent. In order to implement an effective guideline or policy, an organization should consult with experts in various fields, including human rights specialists. It is imperative in every process affecting an individual\u2019s rights, such as work related matters, to inform them of their rights and recourses. It is also important to maintain a transparent dialogue with the individual in a timely, complete and up to date manner. The goal is to respect human dignity in these work related matters, such as in this case, when a medical assessment needs to be performed for a job posting. Considering all these factors contributes to elevating justice standards in our society, in conformity with the human rights enshrined in our Constitution and, in accordance with the quasi-constitutional character of the CHRA.\n[89] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is on a balance of probabilities. Therefore, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (see Premakumar v. Air Canada (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 81). In this case, I find the Afghanistan Guidelines do not reflect equality between all members of society. The application of these guidelines to the complainant resulted in her being discriminated against in the course of her medical assessment. HC has not provided evidence that its conduct was non-discriminatory. Therefore, it has been established that in the course of employment, the complainant suffered adverse differentiation on the basis of her disability by the wording and application of the Afghanistan Guidelines. On the basis of the reasoning above, HC has violated section 7(b) of the CHRA.\nB. The Complaint against CIDA i. The complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination [90] The complainant worked and contributed to CIDA\u2019s development program in Afghanistan. She went on two different temporary missions to Afghanistan and all the members of her team were eventually posted to Afghanistan except her. The factual evidence established that she was always considered a competent employee and, if not for her disability and the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines, she would have been posted in Afghanistan like the rest of her team. CIDA cited HC\u2019s medical information and assessment and the fact that the absolute medical requirements of the Afghanistan Guidelines were not met, in its final decision not to post the complainant in Afghanistan. Therefore, CIDA pursued a medical assessment practice, pursuant to HC\u2019s policies and guidelines, which deprived the complainant of an employment opportunity on a prohibited ground of discrimination: her disability. Therefore, a prima facie case of discrimination has been established under section 10(a) of the CHRA.\n[91] Under section 7(b) of the CHRA, \u201cadverse differentiation\u201d means a \u201cdistinction between persons or groups of persons that is harmful or hurtful to a person or a group of persons\u201d (Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2009 FC 1009 at para. 44; varied on other grounds in Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2010 FCA 192). As stated in the previous paragraph, the complainant has established that a distinction was made between her and her co-workers on the basis of her disability by the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines. This distinction was harmful to the complainant\u2019s career because she lost the opportunity to work and gain field experience in Afghanistan. Therefore, I find that a prima facie case has been established against CIDA under section 7(b) of the CHRA.\n[92] Since a prima facie case has been established under sections 7(b) and 10 of the CHRA, the onus shifts to the respondent CIDA to prove that these prima facie discriminatory practices were based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\nii. CIDA\u2019s discriminatory practice was not based on a bona fide occupational requirement [93] Sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA provide:\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\nany refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n[\u2026]\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n[94] Under section 15(2) of the CHRA, Parliament has chosen to specifically identify the matters that may be taken into account by the Tribunal in an accommodation analysis: health, safety and cost. However, in Air Canada Pilots Association v. Kelly, 2011 FC 120 [Kelly], the Federal Court stated the following:\nThat is not to say that matters such as employee morale and mobility, interference with other employees\u2019 rights, and disruption of a collective agreement could never be relevant in a claim under the CHRA. Rather, [...] in order to be taken into account in an accommodation analysis, these matters must be of a sufficient gravity as to have a demonstrable impact on the operations of an employers in a way that related to health, safety or cost.\n(Kelly at para. 402)\n[95] In addition, although section 15(2) is subject to section 15(9) of the CHRA, which provides for the universality of service for members of the Canadian Forces, the complainant is not a member of the Canadian Forces and, therefore, section 15(9) is not applicable in the present case (See Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2004 CHRT 9 at paras. 30-32; upheld on judicial review in Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2005 FC 122; and, Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2005 FCA 432).\n[96] The analysis used to determine whether an employer\u2019s standard is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) is that outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [Meiorin], as follows:\n(1) that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\n(2) that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\n(3) that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n(Meorin at para. 54)\nSteps One & Two\n[97] The first step of the Meiorin analysis examines the legitimacy of the standard\u2019s general purpose. The second step assesses the employer\u2019s intent in adopting the standard. These steps ensure that \u201c...when viewed both objectively and subjectively, the standard does not have a discriminatory foundation\u201d (Kelly at para. 356; see also McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital general de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC4 at para. 14 [McGill University Health Centre]). The parties agreed that the first and second steps of the Meiorin analysis have been met in the present case. Therefore, I will briefly address these elements as they apply in the present case.\n[98] The Afghanistan Guidelines outline that employees must meet certain medical requirements to be posted in Afghanistan. They identify adverse climatic conditions that may affect the health of employees, including extreme heat, severe atmospheric pollution and exposure to infectious diseases. In this regard, the Afghanistan Guidelines state that access to medical treatment is very limited or may not even be available. The guidelines also identify that there is a significant risk of injury or death from travelling in Afghanistan and that employees live under the threat of physical attacks, even in secured zones. Therefore, the Afghanistan Guidelines are generally designed to determine whether an employee can withstand the stresses imposed by the war conditions in Afghanistan, and to minimize the requirement for medical care, which is in place primarily for the military to treat illnesses and injuries of troops, injured Afghani civilians and unpredictable emergencies that impact all civilians posted in Afghanistan.\n[99] The evidence indicates that the health and safety concerns identified in the Afghanistan Guidelines are legitimate and that medical care is indeed limited in Afghanistan. A detailed outline of the evidence in this regard is provided below. Therefore, a medical fitness standard is rationally connected to the working conditions that CIDA employees must endure in Afghanistan.\n[100] There is no indication in the evidence that the \u201c...imposition of the guideline was not thought to be reasonably necessary or was motivated by discriminatory animus\u201d (Meiorin at para. 60). Therefore, I find that the Afghanistan Guidelines were adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of a legitimate work-related purpose and that the first two steps of the Meiorin analysis are satisfied.\nStep Three\n[101] The third step of the Meiorin analysis examines \u201c...whether the standard is required to accomplish a legitimate purpose, and whether the employer can accommodate the complainant without suffering undue hardship\u201d (Kelly at para. 356; see also McGill University Health Centre at para. 14). The use of the term \"undue\" infers that some hardship is acceptable. It is only \u201cundue hardship\u201d that satisfies this test (see Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at page 984.). Generally, undue hardship means \u201cdisproportionate, improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive\u201d and is \u201c...reached when reasonable measures of accommodation are exhausted and only unreasonable or impracticable options for accommodation remain\u201d (Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15 at paras. 130, 140). The complainant must facilitate the search for meaningful accommodation by responding to reasonable employer requests for relevant medical information regarding his or her limitations, in order to allow the employer to initiate a proposal (Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 CHRT 8; and, Graham v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 40) However, an employee cannot dictate to an employer the precise terms of an accommodation and cannot expect a perfect solution (see McGill University Health Centre; and, Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment), 2003 FCA 133).\n[102] It may be ideal for an employer to adopt a practice or standard that is uncompromisingly stringent, but if it is to be justified it must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship (Meiorin at para. 62.). Furthermore, when an employer is assessing whether it can accommodate an employee it must do an individualized assessment of the employee\u2019s situation. In this regard, in McGill University Health Centre, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: \u201cThe importance of the individualized nature of the accommodation process cannot be minimized\u201d.\n[103] The analysis at this stage looks at \u201c...first, the procedure [...] which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation and, second, the substantive content of either a more accommodating standard which was offered or alternatively the employer's reasons for not offering any such standard\u201d (Meiorin at para. 66). Therefore, I will examine, first, the procedure adopted by CIDA to assess the complainant\u2019s condition and possible accommodation and, second, whether accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan would cause CIDA undue hardship.\nProcedure adopted to assess the complainant\u2019s condition and possible accommodation\n[104] As mentioned above, CIDA does not possess medical expertise, and relied on HC\u2019s medical assessment and the Afghanistan Guidelines in determining that the complainant could not be posted to Afghanistan. In April 2008, based on HC\u2019s recommendation, CIDA informed the complainant that she was not selected for posting in Afghanistan. After finding out that CIDA ultimately had the discretion to determine whether she could be posted in Afghanistan, regardless of HC\u2019s recommendation, the complainant asked CIDA to exercise its discretion and allow her to work in Afghanistan: to accommodate her disability. From this point forward, CIDA had a duty to obtain all relevant information about the employee\u2019s disability and seriously consider how the complainant could be accommodated (see ADGA Group Consultants Inc. v. Lane et al., 91 O.R. (3d) 649 at para. 107 [Lane]). CIDA did not respond to the complainant\u2019s initial request to exercise its discretion to allow her to go to Afghanistan. CIDA did not inform the complainant of, nor were the CIDA officials who testified familiar with, the procedures outlined in FSD9, HC\u2019s medical assessment process or the OHAG. The evidence before the Tribunal contains an email sent from Marion Parry, who works in the Chief mobility exercises and career programs, human resources branch at CIDA, to two other CIDA managers, Joanne Nolan and Michael Collins. She wrote:\nWith regards to next steps...we need to undertake medical screening for any officer you anticipate sending to Afghanistan any duration of TD. This note refers to situation with DND in Kandahar...but we should just do it in a blanket way for Kabul too. I need to draft a response to Major Thurlow can you call me to discuss what process rigour we are now going to put in place.\n[105] According to the evidence and this email, I find, CIDA was actively implicated in the changes that ultimately were seen in the Afghanistan Guidelines used to assess the complainant. I also find that the evidence demonstrated that even if CIDA contends that it only follows HC\u2019s recommendations and does not get involved in the medical assessment process and not having the expertise to do more than to follow their directions, they have much more influence in the whole assessment process than what they put forward.\n[106] In order to establish that a standard is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d, an employer bears the burden of establishing that it considered every possible accommodative measure and determined that it cannot accommodate the employee without experiencing undue hardship (see Meiorin at para. 62; and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 at para. 32 [Grismer]). CIDA did not lead evidence that it explored all reasonable accommodation measures at the time of the complainant\u2019s request. Although CIDA discussed removing the travel requirements of her job, this did not address the complainant\u2019s need for operational field experience to advance her career. When the complainant asked for a list of countries to which she could be posted, it took CIDA over two months to determine that HC would take charge of this determination. It took another two months for HC to determine that insufficient information had been received with respect to six of the 19 countries, and that an addendum would follow once the information was received. HC never provided the addendum and CIDA did not make efforts to insure that an answer to this inquiry was provided. CIDA was of the mindset that offering the abovementioned to the complainant was accommodation as they state it was not part of their standard practice. However, the duty to accommodate is not met by simply going beyond standard practice. It is met by exploring all reasonable accommodation measures up to the point of undue hardship as outlined in Meorin and Grismer above.\n[107] CIDA\u2019s evaluation of accommodative measures was based, almost exclusively, on information provided by HC as CIDA does not possess the expertise to medically asses their employees. Although CIDA has the discretionary power not to follow a medical recommendation given by HC, the evidence has shown that CIDA rarely challenges a HC recommendation. In this regard, HC\u2019s medical recommendation is a determining factor in CIDA\u2019s decision for not posting the complainant to Afghanistan. In addition, HC\u2019s medical assessment process is directly linked to CIDA\u2019s accommodation analysis. However, HC did not provide CIDA with all the information it used in the assessment process, including information about the complainant\u2019s \u201c...current medical condition, prognosis for recovery, ability to perform job duties and capabilities for alternate work\u201d (Lane at para.107). As mentioned above, based on the wording and application of the Afghanistan Guidelines, the individualized nature of the complainant\u2019s condition, including her \u201c...unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity\u201d were not taken into consideration (Meiorin at para. 62). CIDA did not seek another independent medical opinion and did not respond to the complainant\u2019s request to exercise its discretion not to follow HC\u2019s recommendation. On the other hand, if CIDA is not trained to evaluate the medical condition of an individual how will they establish when not to follow HC\u2019s recommendation? Will they need to create another Committee of experts to validate HC\u2019s recommendations? If they decide not to follow the recommendations, what are the consequences if another incident occurs bearing in mind the employer\u2019s duty of care towards its employees?\n[108] Moreover, I find, CIDA tried to facilitate accommodation for the complainant by answering some of her questions on available postings and their requirements. When applying for a posting, evidence suggested that the employees rank countries by preference and, they often write a second and a third choice. CIDA did not attempt up to the point of undue hardship to ensure that the complainant would obtain her second or third choice for a posting overseas. While the employee cannot expect a perfect solution in the accommodation process (See McGill Health Centre (Montreal general hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, 2007 1 S.C.R. 161, at para. 22); CIDA had a practice of working with an employee\u2019s career plan. Michael Collins, Manager in the Afghanistan Task Force at CIDA wrote in an undated email to the complainant and her team:\nThis email is to acknowledge formally that we have either received, or are aware of, your application\/interests in upcoming postings to Afghanistan. The intent is very much to consider this interest on a priority basis. At this juncture, the plan is to set up meetings (or follow up in writing for those overseas) with each of you individually (e.g. with Steve Hallihan) over the next few days by which explore your interest in terms of location, timing, etc. And to review this in the context of your overall career interests and direction within the ATF. Will follow up on this shortly.\n[109] Although the evidence showed some meetings occurred and some efforts were made to help the complainant\u2019s career plan she suffered a different treatment from her peers because of her disability. She could not be posted to Afghanistan and was the only one in her group that was prevented from a posting over there. The reason was not that she was not qualified for the job but rather that she was not fit to go because of her disability and more importantly because of the way the standard in the medical assessment was interpreted. CIDA made attempts to accommodate the complainant but did not offer her any alternative other than applying for other postings and a position in the Afghanistan task force in Ottawa without travel requirements.\n[110] The Complainant had a duty to cooperate in the accommodation process. At the hearing, CIDA argued that the complainant sent mixed messages and did not sufficiently cooperate in the accommodation process. In this regard, CIDA mentioned the fact that the complainant received a reprimand for some of the actions she took in addressing her situation with CIDA. I find the complainant did cooperate in the accommodation process even if some actions were found inappropriate.\n[111] For the above mentioned reasons, CIDA has not met its procedural duty to accommodate the complainant. On this basis, CIDA has not provided a bona fide justification for its discriminatory practices under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. Therefore, on the basis of the complainant\u2019s disability, I find CIDA to have differentiated adversely in relation to the complainant in the course of employment and to have pursued a practice that deprived the complainant of an employment opportunity.\niii. Accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan would constitute undue hardship [112] The evidence clearly established the unique context in which the events leading to the complaints before the Tribunal took place. Does this unique context invalidate the duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship? The Commission argued that not conducting such an analysis would constitute an error of law. I concur. The duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship analysis needs to be done even in a war zone. It might not always be possible to accommodate in a war zone because of the unique conditions of war that could result in undue hardship; however, I reiterate that a case by case, individualized approach, is important because a generalized standard could create injustices if individual characteristics are not considered in the process.\n[113] Although CIDA did not establish that it considered every possible accommodative measure up to the point of undue hardship, I will examine whether it would cause undue hardship to CIDA to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan. I find it necessary to perform this analysis as the parties made substantial submissions on this point and this determination relates to some of the remedies sought by the complainant.\n[114] Above, I found that the wording and effect of the Afghanistan Guidelines resulted in the complainant being discriminated against when she was being medically assessed for a job posting in Afghanistan. I also made a finding that HC relied upon the Afghanistan Guidelines to make their recommendation to CIDA concerning the complainant\u2019s medical fitness to be posted in Afghanistan and that CIDA relied upon HC\u2019s recommendation and the Afghanistan Guidelines to make their final decision not to post the complainant in Afghanistan. On January 11, 2010, Bob Johnston from CIDA wrote a letter to the complainant, which is contained in the agreed statement of facts, informing her that, given HC\u2019s recommendation, no further consideration would be given for her posting. The letter states:\nHc confirmed that the independent medical specialist concluded that you \u201cdid not meet the absolute medical requirements of the OHAG\u201d. HC further stated that the conclusion reached by the independent medical specialist was \u201cconsistent with those reached by the original assessing medical officer\u201d.\nCIDA\u2019s position and conduct in this matter has been and remains consistent with the existing applicable policy, technical and procedural framework. Furthermore, in response to CIDA\u2019s question regarding the necessity of conducting further medical assessments for 2010, HC confirmed that no new assessment was required.\n[115] Bob Johnston finishes his letter to the complainant emphasizing that CIDA\u2019s conduct was within the current policy and procedural framework. I find this confirmed the impact of the Afghanistan guidelines on the complainant\u2019s medical assessment and on CIDA\u2019s decision not to post her to Afghanistan. The letter also explained that Dr. Beauregard arrived to the same conclusion as the other doctors that assessed the complainant but only in the light of the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d.\n[116] Thus being said, I have decided to base my analysis of whether there is undue hardship in accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan on the third medical opinion (Dr. Beauregard\u2019s assessment), leaving aside his conclusion regarding the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d. The HC-MAC was supposed to rely on the third medical opinion, but for reasons already outlined, the HC-MAC had difficulty doing so. Without the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines, Dr. Beauregard\u2019s conditions and recommendations are the accommodative measures that CIDA should have considered in deciding whether the complainant could be posted in Afghanistan. In order for the complainant to be posted in Afghanistan, Dr. Beauregard recommended the following conditions to arrive at an acceptable level of risk for the complainant in Afghanistan :\nAccess to her medication, testing equipment and back-up supplies at all times so that she can monitor her own condition frequently throughout the day.\nLive and sleep in a room with another person aware of her condition\u201d in order to \u201cgain additional security.\nManage to have extra food and insulin to carry with her during travelling.\n[117] There is sufficient evidence before me to find that CIDA considered the possibility of implementing these conditions and arrived at the conclusion that it was not possible. The evidence indicates significant health and safety risks for the complainant in working in Afghanistan, as well as safety risks for those fighting the war in Afghanistan should they have to assist the complainant. For the following reasons, I find that it would pose an undue hardship on CIDA to have to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan.\nHealth Risks\n[118] Development Officers from CIDA posted to Afghanistan contribute to the economic and political development of Afghanistan by a variety of means. At the relevant times, Development Officers could be posted at the Canadian embassy in Kabul, at the KAF or with the PRT in Kandahar. Mr. Johnston described the duties of Development Officers working at these three locations. At the Canadian Embassy in Kabul, responsibilities included liaising closely with Afghan government departments, contributing resources for programs run by international organizations or non-governmental organizations, and travelling frequently in Kabul. With the PRT, where the majority of CIDA\u2019s officers were posted, Development Officers were responsible for managing a portfolio of projects and initiatives. Canada\u2019s aid totalled around 10 million dollars a year, spread over 20 projects, with each officer responsible for up to 4 or 5 projects. As is the case in Kabul, Development Officers were required to travel to meet partners and to visit and monitor project sites. CIDA did not post many officers at the KAF. Their duties there were principally related to coordination with the military. Bob Johnston testified at the hearing:\nTheir role was to ensure that he [the commander] was taking into account the development dimension\". Day to day activities at the KAF included meetings within the KAF, \"but when the general or ROCK was invited to Shura, or site visit they would be expected to accompany, on occasion they would be sent out on their own, to accompany one group or another that was dealing with an issue that involved civilian or military assets.\n[119] Dr. Callary and Dr. Baxter travelled to Afghanistan to visit the different locations where CIDA employees work except one, the PRT. Because of a sandstorm, they were not able to fly over at the PRT. In the event that the complainant suffered an injury and needed evacuation, she would be in greater risk than other employees because of her health condition and the risk would increase in cases such as a sandstorm that could limit the evacuation. The doctors considered that fact in their analysis. Dr. Callary and Dr. Baxter testified and submitted a written report on the possibilities of accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan. They reported that local stressors in Kabul, at the KAF, and at the PRT and wrote in the report that stressors included \u201cgeneral fatigue from working long hours, noise levels and sleep difficulties, small cramped quarters, and lack of freedom to travel and dangers of suicide bombers during travel\u201d. In their view, and CIDA\u2019s view as well, it was a challenge to have the complainant work inside the wire without any traveling requirement because that meant other employees had to travel more to compensate, which increased their exposure to the dangers in the area. When all factors were analysed together, the doctors concluded that it was not possible to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan as the complainant would expose herself to increased stress, infections, and risks of injury that require more medical attention for a person with type 1 diabetes.\n[120] The Tribunal also heard testimony from Dr. John Dupr\u00e9, an endocrinologist expert on behalf of the Respondents. Dr. Dupr\u00e9 was of the opinion that the risk of hypoglycaemic event cannot be completely eliminated for the complainant. He testified that severe hypoglycaemic events, such as the incident involving the complainant in 2008, can reoccur and increase with age and with the frequency of hypoglycaemic events. After considering all available medical evidence regarding the complainant and the situation in Afghanistan, Dr. Dupr\u00e9 considered the complainant at risk for herself and for others and did not for see any possibility for accommodation. He wrote in his report concerning the risk of severe hypoglycaemic event, that it was inevitable for the complainant.\n[121] In his report Dr. Beauregard wrote: \u201cI assumed that she could be posted to Afghanistan, provided that she had access to food, insulin and the necessary equipment for insulin administration and blood glucose monitoring. I did recognize, however, that if she were taken hostage, she would be at greater risk of dying if deprived of food and\/or insulin. Although living and working in difficult conditions imposes an additional challenge to a person having to cope with type 1 diabetes, my assessment, based on the qualifications and the motivation of Ms. Cruden in the management of diabetes, was that she was qualified to be posted to Afghanistan, but only provided that her necessary equipment were made available\u2019\u2019. (Emphasis added). Dr. Beauregard testified that the risk for the complainant of having a severe hypoglycaemic event was \u201creal\u201d. Dr. Arnaout reported that the risk of a hypoglycaemic event is unavoidable. I find that the risks for the complainant of having another severe hypoglycaemic event are present and cannot be eliminated.\n[122] The Tribunal also heard evidence from Colonel Ricard and Major Thurlow. They possessed a good knowledge and expertise of Afghanistan, the war zone context in that country and gave a detailed description of the functioning, locations and goals of the medical facilities in Afghanistan. The two witnesses that testified on these issues testified without contradictions and I found their testimony to be credible. Overall, the evidence of Colonel Ricard and Major Thurlow indicated that the medical facilities in Afghanistan are limited and are operating at full capacity.\n[123] Medical facilities are classified in four categories by the military from Role 1 to Role 4, the Role 1 being the least capable and the Role 4 being the most capable. In Afghanistan, the most capable facility operated by Canadians, now taken over by the Americans, was the Role 3 facility at the KAF. There is no Role 4 facility in Afghanistan. If a person should require a Role 4 facility, the person would be medically evacuated to Germany or Canada if the person is stable enough to travel.\n[124] There are no Canadian medical facilities at the Canadian embassy in Kabul. Moreover, there is no ambulance or 911 services. In any emergency situation, a patient would require transportation by armoured car. The journey may also be delayed due to conflict. Afghan hospitals are considered too dangerous for western nationals. There are two NATO military bases in the vicinity of Kabul that have medical facilities. There is a Role 1 facility at Camp Souter, located 20 minutes away from the embassy. The only Role 3 facility is located at Camp Warehouse, a French NATO base, 10 km east of Kabul. The road to Warehouse from Camp Souter is said to be dangerous, requiring the full military support of 8 soldiers to move one ill person. Camp Warehouse will provide medical services \u201cin extremis\u2019\u2019 if it is not detrimental to the medical support of ISAF personnel. Finally, an ISAF pass is required for entry onto the base. Without an ISAF pass for vehicle access, entry may be refused or severely delayed.\n[125] Both the KAF and the PRT have a Role 1 and a Role 3 facility. The Role 1 facility at the KAF and at the PRT are capable of providing for patients needing minor procedures. These facilities do not have a lab or an x-ray machine and the pharmacy does not carry a full stock of medications. The hours of operation are from 07:30 to 16:30. A Role 1 facility is staffed with a medical officer and a physician\u2019s assistant and was described as being similar to a family medicine office. The medical officer is like a family physician or a general physician. The physician\u2019s assistant was described as an extension of the medical officer, similar to a nurse practitioner with a trauma focus rather than an illness focus. Both the medical officer and the physician\u2019s assistant cover for each other when the other is away for \u201creal life situations\u201d. A Role 1 facility is used for triage only and, as a result, they do not have beds.\n[126] A Role 2 facility has a limited capacity as well. A patient may stay from a few hours to a couple of days. In a Role 2 facility only damage control surgery is provided to stabilize the patient. If further surgery is required the patient will have to be moved to a Role 3 facility.\n[127] The Role 3 facility at the PRT was a Canadian run facility, but by nature it is a multinational facility. Although other nations are there at times, primarily it is Canadians and Americans stationed at the facility. It is a make shift facility with add-ons. One hundred and sixty people work at the facility. There are 6 Intensive Care Unit beds (ICU), 6 Triage beds, 12 holding beds and 3 Operating rooms. The bottle necks are the triage and the ICU beds.\n[128] The Role 3 facility at the KAF is staffed with two surgical teams, an orthopaedic surgeon, a psychiatrist and one internal medicine specialist. There are 12 regular beds and 4 (ICU) beds, 16 beds in total and all in the same room. Colonel Ricard, (First Task Force Surgeon) serving at the KAF described the capacity of the facility as being \u201cvery very small\u2019\u2019. He also testified the 16 beds are kept filled at 80%-90% capacity at all times. In the fall of 2009, the Americans took over command of the facility. KAF is now a modern structure, with a trauma focused hospital, but can take on illnesses if need be. KAF now has 12 ICU beds and 12 Triage beds, increasing its capacity.\n[129] Colonel Ricard described the workload of military doctors at the KAF as extremely busy, with three major trauma surgeries per day on average. The doctors at the facility work at an intensive pace that is not sustainable for more than six months. In this regard, Colonel Ricard testified to the following:\nSo you see as a commanding officer your staff which are all well trained and dedicated getting tired and tired and tired. And the way I saw it is that we squeeze them like a sponge for the 6 months they are there, there\u2019s only a 3 week vacation during that six months, we burn them completely out and then we send them home to recuperate, but we couldn\u2019t do that for one year, 2 years-3 years working at the Ottawa civic as my regular job with the intensitivity (sic) of what was happening over there.\n[130] Major Thurlow was the Watchkeeper at the joint operations centre of KAF. As such, he was responsible for responding to calls for medical emergencies, and would help determine the means of evacuating a casualty. In that task, he had up to date current knowledge of bed states within all of the hospital facilities in his area of operations. He testified as to the following with regards to the hospital codes that conveyed the level of occupancy of a facility:\nColor code determines the capacity to accept patients. And this is known at the joint operations centre as something monitored minute to minute. A facility at green means that is has a capacity to take casualties, no restrictions. A facility at yellow, means 75% capacity is reached. Could be ICU beds, triage, war beds. You get to red, 90% of the hospital has been met. Finally you get to black, Black is 100% so they are maxed out, the facility cannot take any more casualties\u2019\n[131] Major Thurlow testified that the Role 3 facility at the KAF frequently would encounter red or black color code scenarios. Major Thurlow added that hospital occupancy had an impact on both military operations and medical treatment. A commander may curtail military operations if he is made aware that a facility is in the red and would be unable to treat casualties. A red or black code also means that the military will prioritize who will get care. As such, NATO helicopters would prioritize evacuations depending on the casualty\u2019s role and nationality, giving priority to coalition forces, western nationals, etc.\n[132] Patients are categorized according to their injury by type A, B or C. A patient in category A requires treatment within the hour, which is referred to as the golden hour. A category A patient will have priority over all others. Their situation is urgent and the most expedient methods are used to get them care. This patient is always moved by air. For a category B patient the window in which one must act goes up to 4 hours and they can be moved to a different location once stabilized. A category B patient is at risk from a life threatening injury but the risk is less elevated than a category A patient. A category C patient is a routine patient and can be moved within 24 hours.\n[133] There is no ambulance or 911 service in Afghanistan. Rather, where a medical emergency arises there is a limitation on the health care that can be given on site, as is the case at the PRT for example. If the situation is an A or B category, a medical evacuation mission is required and care will not be provided on site, the person has to be moved to another location which involves additional safety risks for the injured person and the caregivers and the military. Evidence showed that if a person with type 1 diabetes gets shot there are additional risks to their health. Risks of being injured or shot, even in the PRT, were said to be \u201creal not slim\u2019\u2019.\nSafety Risks\n[134] Apart from the health concerns, civilian employees working in Afghanistan are under constant threat of attack. CIDA employees posted in Afghanistan receive an additional remuneration called a \u201chostility bonus\u201d in recognition of the dangers inherent with working in a war zone and the severe living conditions of the mission. At all three sites where CIDA officers operate, KAF, Kabul and the PRT compound, the security conditions were described as very dangerous.\n[135] Major Thurlow testified that KAF gets shelled fairly regularly and consistently. Colonel Ricard was the Task Force Surgeon at the KAF for a period of nine months and he testified that during that time there were 70 rocket attacks on the KAF. At the time of the hearing of this case, Major Thurlow testified that the KAF had recently suffered a rocket attack that landed in the dining facilities, injuring several people and killing one person. In cross examination, Colonel Ricard disagreed with complainant counsel\u2019s suggestion that the risks of injury at the KAF were \u201cquite low\u201d: \u201cThe chances of injury within KAF are real \u2013 not quite low. [...] There\u2019s a significant risk to life in KAF \u2013 all people have to have flak jackets and helmets accessible\u201d.\n[136] Bob Johnston, described the escalation of dangerous conditions in Kabul during the summer of 2008. He testified that in 2008, security was breached at a hotel used by foreign nationals. This hotel was previously considered \u201csecure\u201d. This security breach was followed by the first of the Indian embassy bombings, where fertilizer-loaded vehicles were blown up. Body parts were found in the Canadian embassy, located half a mile away. Mr. Johnston testified that the security measures at the Canadian embassy in Kabul are the most expensive when compared to any other Canadian embassy in the world. After the events described above, the embassy hired a security firm that had both Afghan personnel and former members of the British Special Forces. CIDA officers attending meetings at the Canadian embassy were driven in armoured cars with an armed driver. In 2009, the embassy instituted \u201cclose protection\u201d protocols, whereby employees were accompanied by these former members of the British Special Forces to meetings to help with extraction in the event of a suicide bombing, which was often followed by gun fire.\n[137] The PRT compound is also under threat of attack. Drs. Callary and Baxter reported that \u201cfirefights occur 300 to 400m away from the walls of the PRT, requiring employees to stay in bunkers\u201d. Bob Johnston testified that in 2009, everyone at the PRT was evacuated because of a threat of major attack.\n[138] The constant threat of attack also impacts on medical evacuations. Medical evacuations can be done either by armoured vehicle or by helicopter. Given the dangers of travelling by vehicle, most medical evacuations are done by helicopter. Major Thurlow, who was responsible for monitoring battles and dispatching helicopters to rescue casualties, testified that there were 15 helicopters, most if not all American, responsible for all the medical evacuations in the area of operations known as Regional Command South, which comprises 5 southern provinces of Afghanistan. In 2009, these 15 helicopters performed 5,300 medical evacuations, and transported 7,500 casualties. This number does not include patient transfers from one facility to another, which are done with the same 15 helicopters. There was an average of 16 medical evacuations a day, but this number could rise to as many as 32:\none day, we had 32 medevacs missions flown \u2013 and that means that everyone is working to full capacity \u2013 they are flying from one mission to the next to the next \u2013 you have facilities filling up, and in that day, we denied care\n[139] Major Thurlow also testified about the dangers of evacuating casualties in Afghanistan. Each mission requires two helicopters to be flown, with each helicopter carrying three people. One helicopter will land while the other provides protection. According to Major Thurlow :\nSo 2 helicopters will go out, to pick up the casualty because of the security risk, the 2nd helicopter will either be a second medevac helicopter, or if the security risk is considered high in the area, the 2nd helicopter is an attack helicopter. But both helicopters have the capacity to defend themselves. Both helicopters will go out to pick up the casualty. One helicopter lands, the medical team, there\u2019s approximately 3 people per helicopter. They\u2019ll get off, assess the casualty bring the casualty in the helicopter. The other one stays in the air and provides protection to that helicopter, interdicts any enemy that may appear or try to involve themselves in the event. Interdiction is common \u2013 not unexpected. These helicopters are shot at \u2013 all helicopters are shot at. If they\u2019re flying around they are shot at. It\u2019s a dangerous job.\n[140] Major Thurlow added that Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) constitute another danger faced by soldiers performing medical evacuations. On one occasion, while making their way back to the helicopter after placing a casualty on a stretcher, two stretcher bearers became amputees when they stepped on an IED.\nOther Safety Considerations\n[141] I also consider the following factors to be relevant to safety in evaluating undue hardship in the circumstances of this case.\n1. Accommodating the complainant in Afghanistan and the effect it may have on the success of the mission\n[142] The success of the Afghanistan mission, like for all other UN political or peace keeping missions, is optimal when good collaboration exists. The same principle applies for CIDA missions. Does accommodation in a war zone negatively impact the relationship between the different actors in place? We have to bear in mind that the success of UN and other international missions, such as the CIDA mission in Afghanistan, relies upon the effective partnerships and good relations between the military and the different actors. The more negative the impact is, the closer it is to undue hardship, because of the effects it will have on the mission and on the people involved. While the Canadian Forces does not dictate to the Canadian Government how to manage their projects, they are the specialists when it comes to combat zones. Their evaluation is indispensible when it comes to the living conditions in place in the combat zone and the level of risk in those situations. The evidence established that the military are in charge of determining which medical facility a casualty will be sent to and for planning all evacuations and every move of Canadian civilians from the different camps to other parts of the country. Cooperation and good relations with the military is necessary to successfully accomplish the mission.\n[143] In the present case, relations were affected by the absence of a process needed to prevent medical incidents, such as the one that occurred involving the complainant in 2008.\n[144] At the time of the incident, Ron Shatz, Director of Development at the PRT in Kandahar wrote an email to Mr. Hallihan and Mr. Metcalfe in the ATF, CIDA:\nit was a concern for those who attended to her. The thought of a reoccurrence does not sit well with any of us here\n[145] Both the Complainant and Respondents relied in their evidence on this email from Ron Shaltz:\nthe medical staff this morning, told me there was no way he would have he stay at the KPRT, that she was putting others at risk, although I find it a stretch, he immediately ordered a chopper and she was evacuated to KAF within 90 minutes. He reckons this type of condition (he was told by his medic that B. Was near to diabetic coma) cannot be accepted here and that if this were to happen in a FOB there would be no life support with potentially disastrous circumstances. He made it clear he would not accept B. For a short or long term assignment here.\n[146] After the complainant\u2019s hypoglycaemic incident in 2008, the military, in consultation with their internal doctor, found that it was unwise of CIDA to send civilians to a war zone without properly screening employees for chronic conditions that could put them, others and, the whole mission at risk. As a result, the Afghanistan Guidelines were modified and the evidence showed that this helped improve relations with the military. While the military is not in charge of CIDA missions, they certainly have a word on how they wish to operate when they put their soldiers at risk. In this regard, the intention of the Afghanistan Guidelines was to improve cooperation and safety between the different partners involved in the mission in Afghanistan. The complainant testified that the military and her employer overreacted in response to her hypoglycaemic incident in 2008. I disagree. I find the situation could have been much worse if no one heard her in her sleep or if an attack on the base had occurred at the time the complainant was incapacitated. In the light of the evidence, a person with type 1 diabetes may require the help of a third person to get a glucagon injection or intravenous glucose in case of a severe hypoglycaemic event or consequences could be disastrous. The complainant also fails to consider the overall consequences that another hypoglycaemic incident could have on her safety and the safety of others, let alone the repercussions this could have on the relationship between CIDA and the military and the success of the Afghanistan mission.\n2. The level of control over the environment\n[147] The more control one can exert over a given environment the less a BFOR and undue hardship is justifiable; the less control one can exert over a given environment the more the BFOR defence up to the point of undue hardship standard is preserved.\n[148] An analysis of who has the control over the environment must be performed under this criterion. The more the employer has control over the environment and the outcomes of a mission, the more accommodation should be possible without suffering undue hardship. If the employer needs to rely on third parties to control the environment, the impact on the third party should be considered in the analysis of undue hardship. Will the accommodation be supported by other third parties who insure the success of the mission?\n[149] In a war zone, control over the environment presents some challenges; if it did not, no civil casualties would occur because safety would be assured. The evidence above concerning the war zone context in Afghanistan establishes that the dangers over there are real and that lives are constantly in danger. In this light, it is imperative to keep in mind the answers to the following questions:\nWhat are the consequences if the accommodation is enforced? Will others be put in danger because of the accommodation? What are the impacts on the rights of other CIDA employees, civilians, soldiers, facilities, etc...?\n[150] In the present case does accommodation require that others take action on the complainant\u2019s behalf that imposes undue hardship on them? Is it reasonable or even possible for an employer to respect the accommodation on its own without the collaboration of partners?\n[151] CIDA\u2019s work in Afghanistan depends on the military for various purposes and, most importantly, for security reasons. Although CIDA operates civilian projects in Afghanistan, the military is directly involved in the operational aspects of these missions and the reality is that some are so involved that they lose their lives in the course of their duty.\n[152] In assessing the evidence on this issue of who has control over the environment and the safety in the war zone, I prefer that of the respondent CIDA over that of the complainant\u2019s. When the complainant testified, she attempted to minimize the dangers in Afghanistan. At the same time, she claims the hostility bonus as a remedy in this case. She said that no CIDA employee had been killed or kidnapped. I do not consider this evidence to be relevant considering that a Canadian diplomat has been killed, and other Canadian civilians have been injured or kidnapped in Afghanistan. The complainant\u2019s evidence was not convincing on that issue. The evidence demonstrated that CIDA alone is not able to control the environment in Afghanistan to ensure reasonable safety to its employees. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the military to control the safety of the environment in Afghanistan. I find that CIDA has a very low level of control over the complainant\u2019s work environment in Afghanistan. I find the military has some level of control, but cannot guarantee complete control in the war zone in Afghanistan.\nConclusion on undue hardship\n[153] The Commission argued that the risks already present in the environment should be taken into consideration when assessing whether accommodating the complainant would pose an unacceptable level of risk. The Commission and the complainant claimed that every civilian posted to Afghanistan accepts a certain amount of risk, as do the military in cooperating with CIDA. Although this is true, the question remains, is it wise to consider adding more risks to an already risky environment? Is this approach acceptable in a war zone?\n[154] The Commission referred to Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 2006 SCC 6 [Multani] to sustain its position on risk. The events in the Multani case took place in a Quebec public school, in Canada, a peaceful country where no one expects a rocket to fall on the school\u2019s roof. If any emergencies arise, no insurgents will impede the paramedics or the police from arriving quickly to assist. In Afghanistan, the scenario is significantly different from that in Multani. However, I do find the Multani decision to be instructive in the sense that each environment is different and that the level of risk in that environment must be analysed on a case by case basis. In this regard, the Supreme Court stated the following:\nAlthough there is no need in the instant case for this Court to compare the desirable level of safety in a given environment with the desirable level in a school environment, these decisions show that each environment is a special case with its own unique characteristics that justify a different level of safety, depending on the circumstances.\n(See Multani at para. 66)\n[155] In the same vein, in Nijjar v. Canada 3000 Airlines Ltd. (1999), 36 C.H.R.R. D\/76 [Nijjar], the Tribunal stated the following:\nIn assessing whether or not the respondent's weapons policy can be modified so as to accommodate Sikhs detrimentally affected, consideration must be given to the environment in which the rule must be applied. In this regard, we are satisfied that aircraft present a unique environment. Groups of strangers are brought together and are required to stay together, in confined spaces, for prolonged periods of time. Emergency medical and police assistance are not readily accessible.\nThe Commission points out that airplanes contain all manner of items such as wine bottles, crutches and walking sticks, all of which have the potential to be used as weapons but are allowed on board. While it is true that these types of items could theoretically be used as weapons, in light of Dr. McAuliffe's evidence with respect to the offensive capacity of wine bottles, and having regard to the confined space inside an aircraft in which crutches or walking sticks could be wielded, we do not think that the risk posed by items of this nature can be equated to that posed by kirpans.\nUnlike the school environment in issue in the Pandori case, where there is an ongoing relationship between the student and the school and with that a meaningful opportunity to assess the circumstances of the individual seeking the accommodation, air travel involves a transitory population. Significant numbers of people are processed each day, with minimal opportunity for assessment.\n(Nijjar at paras. 123-125)\n[156] That being said, proof of undue hardship can take \u201c...as many forms as there are circumstances\u201d (Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000, 2008 SCC 43 at para. 12). Indeed, accommodating an employee in a war zone is a unique situation and the respondents have led proof of the specific working conditions in Afghanistan as outlined above. As safety is at issue in this case, \u201c...both the magnitude of the risk and the identity of those who bear it are relevant considerations\u201d (Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489 at p. 521). The evidence outlined above indicates that not only are there serious health and safety risks present for Canadians working in Afghanistan, but that these risks frequently materialize and the danger is real. The evidence also indicates that it is not only the complainant or CIDA employees who bear these risks, but also members of the Canadian Forces and other foreign military personnel; most notably, the helicopter teams that perform medical evacuations. The Covenant on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities addresses how to counterbalance persons with disabilities with others rights:\nArticle 10 - Right to life\nStates Parties reaffirm that every human being has the inherent right to life and shall take all necessary measures to ensure its effective enjoyment by persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.\nArticle 11 - Situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies\nStates Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters.\n(Emphasis added)\n[157] In this same vein, medical services are limited and bed space must be preserved for the treatment of troops, injured Afghani civilians and unpredictable emergencies that impact all civilians posted in Afghanistan. The complainant attempted to show that the situation in Afghanistan was not as dangerous as the respondents claimed, and that any risks could be brought within an acceptable level. However, the war conditions in Afghanistan are such that control over the complainant\u2019s work environment is limited at best due to the unstable conditions of war and the fact that CIDA relies on the military to provide security for their employees while in Afghanistan. Despite every military protection and precaution, many people have been hurt and killed in Afghanistan, attacks against military compounds occur, convoys are ambushed, and it has been necessary to evacuate CIDA personnel from certain locations at times. While the complainant argued that no CIDA employee has been kidnapped or killed, this does nothing to minimize the risk or reduce the probability of it actually happening. Adding additional risks to the pre-existing circumstances and to the other unexpected circumstances in Afghanistan puts lives, aside from the complainant\u2019s, in added jeopardy.\n[158] Everyone posted in Afghanistan accepts a level of risk to their safety. The complainant and the Commission argue that the level of risk for the complainant is a little higher, but could be brought within an acceptable level if the employer implements Dr. Beauregard\u2019s conditions and allows the complainant to work without travel. They both refer to a level of reasonable safety and argue that the standard applied by CIDA is a level of absolute safety. I do not find CIDA to be applying a standard of absolute safety, which would result in not allowing any CIDA employee to be posted in Afghanistan considering all the risks present in the environment. I do find the standard to be high, but this as it should be when lives and health are at stake. While military personnel risk their lives every day in Afghanistan, they assume this risk in furtherance of Canada\u2019s mission in Afghanistan. It would be an unreasonable risk for them to put their lives in danger for the sole purpose of accommodating the complainant. In this regard, \u201c[t]he factors that will support a finding of undue hardship [...] must be applied with common sense and flexibility\u201d (McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital general de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, at para. 15). The right to life commands that the highest standard possible be upheld, this is in accordance with principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Any accommodation must respect the lives of others, lives that would be impacted by the decision to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan. The argument that the military takes risks everyday is not sufficient to impose on those already risking their lives additional risk for the purpose of accommodating the complainant.\n[159] After having examined all the evidence in this case, I believe that in a stable environment, the complainant manages the symptoms of her condition very well. She is well informed about her condition and explained very clearly how she manages it. On this issue, she is very credible. The same cannot be said about the management of her condition in Afghanistan. She testified that she mistakenly gave herself two doses of insulin, when only one was required, and that she forgot to measure her blood sugar level before going to bed. When asked the reason for this mistake, she explained that it was because she was playing cards and was distracted. I believe her when she says that she learned from that experience; however, I also note that she requested sick leave in June 2008 because dealing with HC and CIDA caused her stress and was affecting her condition and evidence established the nexus between the low A-1-C a type of test that measures her blood sugar levels and the same period where stress was present for the complainant. This request was written by the same doctor, her treating doctor, Dr. Arnaout that originally said the complainant was fit for posting in Afghanistan. I weight this information in the rest of all the evidence induced. The stress related to the discrimination pales in comparison to the high level of stress in Afghanistan. My conclusions in this regard do not change even if an invasive psychological stress test declared her fit in Canada. I cannot give it more weight than the solid evidence that CIDA put forward with an extensive description by the military on the conditions present in the war zone in Afghanistan. Details were given on the mission, on medical evacuations and the complainant did not succeed in contradicting this evidence. The evidence showed that even if the restrictions suggested by Dr. Beauregard were enforced, they cannot necessarily be respected at all times if an emergency or life-threatening situation occurs. There is no guarantee that the complainant would always have all the necessary equipment for insulin administration on her, especially in a rocket attack or an ambush. Moreover, nothing in the evidence showed that she would properly manage her condition in an ambush or a rocket attack, and it becomes even more speculative when other CIDA employees\u2019 reactions are required to assist the complainant.\n[160] Based on the evidence and my reasons above, and subject to my findings regarding CIDA\u2019s procedural breach of the duty to accommodate, I believe that it would constitute undue hardship for CIDA to have to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan considering the risk to the complainant\u2019s health and safety, and the safety of CIDA employees and those fighting the war in Afghanistan.\nVII. Conclusion [161] The evidence indicates that it would be an undue hardship for CIDA to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, CIDA has breached its procedural duty to explore all reasonable accommodation measures for the complainant and, as a result, a violation of sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA has been made out against CIDA.\n[162] For its part, HC developed the Afghanistan Guidelines, which do not reflect equality between all members of society. In the course of employment, the complainant suffered adverse differentiation on the basis of her disability by the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines. On this basis, HC has violated section 7(b) of the CHRA.\n[163] Therefore, both complaints are substantiated and the Tribunal will consider appropriate remedial action to eliminate these discriminatory practices.\nVIII. Remedies [164] When a complaint under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA has been substantiated, the Tribunal has remedial authority to make an order under the terms of sections 53(2), 53(3) and 53(4) of the CHRA, which sections provide as follows:\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n(4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\n[165] The aim of the CHRA is remedial and is \u201c...not aimed at determining fault or punishing conduct\u201d (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13 [Robichaud]). Rather, the primary focus of the legislation is to \u201c...identify and eliminate discrimination\u201d (Robichaud at para. 13). The Tribunal deals with complex and emotional disputes between parties, which demands \u201c...innovation and flexibility on the part of the Tribunal in fashioning effective remedies and the Act is structured so as to encourage this flexibility\u201d (Grover v. Canada (National Research Council - NRC) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (Fed. Ct. TD) [Grover]). Although the Tribunal has remedial flexibility and discretion under section 53, this discretion is not unlimited. In the context of discussing the limit on the liability for compensation under the CHRA, the Federal Court of Appeal in Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 [Chopra], stated:\nThe first limit is that recognized by all members of the Court in Morgan, that is, there must be a causal link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed. The second limit is recognized in the Act itself, namely, the discretion given to the Tribunal to make an order for compensation for any or all of wages lost as a result of the discriminatory practice. This discretion must be exercised on a principled basis.\n(Chopra at para. 37)\nStated more generally:\n...orders of a remedial nature must be linked or have a nexus to the lis or subject-matter of the complaint substantiated by the tribunal: the \"four corners of the complaint\" or \"the real subject matter\". The remedy must be commensurate with the breach. The orders also must be reasonable and the remedial discretion exercised in light of the evidence presented.\n(Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 [Hughes] at para. 50)\n[166] In implementing remedial orders, the CHRC or other parties may be involved in terms of consultation or monitoring. The involvement of other actors recognizes that the Tribunal has an adjudicative role that does not translate well into the technical or task-specific aspects of the implementation of orders often affecting the day-to-day operations of a governmental or corporate respondent (see Hughes at para 51).\n[167] In consideration of these principles, the following are my reasons with regards to the remedies requested by the complainant and the Commission.\nCompensation for lost bonuses and allowances\n[168] The complainant is seeking compensation pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the CHRA for lost bonuses and allowances for the 18 month period of the Afghanistan posting she did not receive. These bonuses and allowances include: a lost hostility bonus and a lost post differential bonus of $17,627.00 for a period of 12 months or $26,440.00 for a period of 18 months; a special risk premium of $10, 015.00 for a period of 12 or 18 months; a lost incidental relocation bonus of $4,106.00 for a period of 12 or 18 months; compensation for lost vacation travel allowance [allowance less hours required to be used for R&R Leave] at the PM-05 for the amount of $32,708.00 for 12 months for a one year posting and $49,062.00 for 18 months for a period of 6 months and a period of one year, at the PM-06 level for the amount of $31,779.00 for 12 months and $47,505.00 for 18 months; compensation for lost overtime opportunities less overtime already earned in Canada, at the PM-05 level [$5,034 less $774 per month] for 12 months $38,340.00, at the PM-06 level 2 2008 [$5,682 less $774 per month] for 12 months $44,174.00, at the PM-06 level 3 2009 [$5,767 less $774 per month] for 18 months $66,642.00, calculated based on level 2 for 12 months plus level 3 for 6 months; compensation for lost rental income for 12 months $14,400 and for 18 months $21,600; compensation for household expenses incurred for 12 months $5,808 and for 18 months $8,712.\n[169] CIDA has established that it would cause undue hardship for it to accommodate the complainant in Afghanistan. Therefore, I will not grant any amount directly linked to the posting in Afghanistan such as the special risk premium or the hostility bonus. The hostility bonus is specific to dangerous areas with the highest hardship levels and is not allocated in every international mission. In the present case, for the Tribunal to award the complainant compensation for a hostility bonus, the Tribunal must be satisfied that she was to be posted in Afghanistan. Since it has been established that it would have caused undue hardship to post the complainant in Afghanistan, any amount related to the Afghanistan posting cannot be granted. Section 53(2)(c) aims to compensate the victim for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. I do not find any logical explanation for claiming relocation, lost rental income, household expenses, etc. The complainant did not incur these expenses. The expenses should be reimbursed if spent and not claimed without being incurred. This being said, I believe that if it were not for the adverse differential treatment that the complainant received during the whole medical assessment and posting process, the complainant would have obtained a position in another country. Although she was denied the Afghanistan posting she would have been suited, at the least, for a friendly country. I find that she would have had to do overtime more than in Canada but not as much as in Afghanistan where conditions are harsh. The complainant testified that there is not a lot to do in Afghanistan, so in the end, CIDA employees tend to do more hours of work than normal. The evidence also established that it is reasonable to assume she would have been at a PM-06 level because of her previous work. I will elaborate on my reasons in this regard under the Appointment and Deployment section of the remedies in the decision. I do not have sufficient material before me to quantify the average amount of overtime that an employee at the PM-06 level would work in a friendly country. Therefore, I will allow two months for parties to provide submissions on the appropriate amount and remain seized of the matter until this information is available.\nCompensation for pain and suffering\n[170] The complainant is claiming compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $20,000 pursuant to, paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. The amount of $20,000 is the maximum allowed within the boundaries of CHRA under this head of damages. Moral pain and suffering is difficult to quantify. When someone suffers, the only person that has real knowledge of that particular suffering is the person who experienced it. When someone goes through pain there is no amount of money that can accurately compensate for that pain. Moral pain related to discrimination is subjective and varies from one individual to another. From the point of view of the person that suffered discrimination, large amounts of money should be granted to reflect what they have experienced and to provide them justice. No one should suffer and no amount can reflect this injustice. The amount allowed will never fully put the person back in the situation as though the discrimination never occurred, because of the subjective element of it and the limits of the CHRA and of the case law. Psychological scars often take a long time to heal and can affect a person\u2019s self worth. This being said, when evidence establishes pain and suffering an attempt to compensate for it must be made. The complainant requested sick leave because of how she felt at work with how CIDA and HC handled the medical assessment and accommodation process. She awaited answers from both respondents that never came. The complainant was told that the HC-MAC committee would accept the third medical opinion, but in the end they did not and, meanwhile, made the complainant undergo tests that kept her hopes up. The complainant\u2019s hopes were shattered by the way the situation was handled by both respondents. She was not informed of her rights and was mislead in two ways: (1) by being told that a list of countries where she could be posted would be provided; and, (2) that as soon as doctors in those countries provided the necessary medical information, she would receive more information. The information was never given and no follow up was made by the respondents. The complainant lost opportunities to be posted outside of Canada because of these delays. In the whole process, the complainant felt adversely treated because of her condition and felt her dignity was infringed upon. After considering previous amounts awarded by this Tribunal and all the evidence, I order the respondents to each pay the complainant $5,000.\nCompensation for wilful and reckless discrimination\n[171] The complainant is seeking special compensation for wilful and reckless discrimination in the amount of $20,000, pursuant to paragraph 53(3) of the CHRA. The complainant did not present any case law to support this claim nor were extensive arguments provided, but the evidence is sufficient to pursue the analysis on the matter. The evidence established that HC told the complainant they would accept the independent medical opinion whatever it may be. They were aware of what they said and modified their approach when the opinion was not what they expected. They also worded the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u2019\u2019 and admitted at the hearing that it was a poor choice of words that indeed could mislead someone doing an assessment. HC did not try to correct the wording of the guidelines when they submitted the information to Doctor Beauregard, nor did they give him section one of the OHAG, which says that the guidelines are instructive and not mandatory. Therefore, HC knew what they were doing. On its part, CIDA refused to respond to the complainant\u2019s email requesting it to exercise its discretionary power to post her to Afghanistan. CIDA cannot ignore the fact that no additional information was given to the complainant on other overseas postings. After reviewing the evidence and the Tribunal\u2019s other decisions under this head of compensation, I find that in behaving in such a way, both respondents engaged in wilful and reckless discrimination pursuant to the terms of section 53(3) of the CHRA. I order the respondents to each pay the complainant $5,000.\nSick leave credits\n[172] Pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, the complainant seeks reinstatement of sick leave credits totalling 55 days. The 55 days are related to the sick leave she took in the summer of June 2009. It corresponds to a period of time when her doctor said that the stress related to the discrimination and work related issues affected her blood sugar levels and her condition. The evidence corroborated the doctor\u2019s recommendation. Therefore, I order the reinstatement of the totality of the complainant\u2019s sick leave credits.\nVacation day credits\n[173] The complainant is also seeking reinstatement of vacation time credits totalling 15 days taken in order to prepare for and attend proceedings related to her complaint. Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(C) of the CHRA, I order the reinstatement of the 15 vacation day credits.\nAppointment and deployment\n[174] The complainant is seeking an appointment to a position at the EX-01 level within CIDA, pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA. She also seeks deployment to an operational position within CIDA\u2019s Geographic Programs Branch (GPB), pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA and requests to be posted to a family-friendly country of her choice.\n[175] In December of 2008, the complainant was promoted to International Development Program Manager of the R+A Unit, a position at the PM-06 level (she had been acting in this position since May of 2007). At the same time, the complainant applied for and won an acting assignment as the Senior Departmental Assistant in the Minister\u2019s office, a position at the level of A\/EX-1. The complainant resigned from her position as Acting Senior Department Assistant and took a short-term medical leave starting on or around June 20, 2009. On or around September 1, 2009, the complainant returned to her previous position as International Development Program Manager with the R+A Unit, where she continues to work. The respondents argued that there is no obligation to give a posting to the complainant since she already has a good position within CIDA and that she was hired at a higher position than a lot of CIDA employees start at. I disagree. I find if it were not for her disability she would have obtained a posting to Afghanistan or elsewhere because of her abilities to perform the duties required. CIDA never contested that she was a good employee with the abilities to succeed in higher positions. In fact, the evidence suggests in an email from Dave Metcalfe (Results and Accountability ATF CIDA) to Michael Collins they qualified her as \u201cawesome a great resource and an excellent employee\u201d.\n...perhaps we can do what we can to perhaps position her elsewhere in the Agency that would lead to a posting in a different location for which HC would support given the situation....We should try to keep her within the ATF or at least within the Agency\n[176] On this basis, pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, I order CIDA to deploy the complainant in the GPB at the PM-06 level and to work with the complainant to post her in a friendly country within her top three choices where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions that she will face.\nPersonnel file\n[177] The complainant requested immediate removal from her personnel file any reprimand related to her pursuit of this complaint, pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA. The evidence tendered by CIDA indicated that the reprimand was linked to the complainant\u2019s behaviour at work when she sent emails and talked to more people than she needed to about the complaints. The evidence showed that she sometimes used a harsh tone in her emails. The complainant argued that she was asked to withdraw her complaint in exchange for a position. This allegation was not corroborated and the person in question that supposedly said this to her did not testify before the Tribunal. Therefore, I do not place any weight on it. If the reprimand was made because she made a complaint against CIDA, I would have considered it retaliation. I do not believe it was for this reason but rather because she made several attempts, even to the Minister\u2019s office, to make her point. When asked why she made threats and bad comments towards some of the CIDA management team, the complainant admitted that she did not act rationally in those acts. Although defending one\u2019s rights is legitimate, it has to be done within appropriate boundaries; if not, one has to bear the consequences. Therefore, the request is denied.\nLegal fees\n[178] The complainant is seeking compensation for legal fees in the amount of $2,712.68. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309 [Mowat], the Federal Court of Appeal found that the CHRT has no authority to make an award of costs under the provisions of the CHRA. Leave to appeal to the SCC has been granted. However, based on Mowat, I do not award any amount for legal fees.\nSystemic remedies\n[179] The complainant is seeking the following:\n- an order that the respondents cease their discriminatory practices against employees seeking postings overseas who are captured by the absolute medical ban contained in the policies applied by the respondents in assessing employees\u2019 medical fitness for oversees postings;\n- an order that the respondents consult with the Commission (CHRC), in accordance with paragraph 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, to develop a plan to prevent further incidents of discrimination based on disability in the medical assessment of employees seeking overseas postings; and\n- an order that the respondents establish written policies satisfactory to Ms. Cruden and the Commission to address the assessment of medical suitability for overseas postings within six months, and that these policies include a process for individualized assessments of those being assessed.\n- Findings were made concerning the inappropriate wording of the Afghanistan Guidelines. The \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d create a prima facie case of discrimination against people living with chronic conditions and create adverse differential treatment when applied. Improvements are required in the medical assessment and posting processes to remedy this discrimination.\n- The Covenant on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in its Preamble section o. mentions: \u201cConsidering that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including those directly concerning them,...\u2019\u2019.\n[180] For these reasons, I order all of the measures outlined above in the light of the evidence and findings in this case.\nAmendments to HC policies and guidelines and amendments to CIDA\u2019s policies\n[181] The evidence and findings in the present case established the fact that the Afghanistan Guidelines, moreover, the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d need to be replaced to prevent any adverse differential treatment and to allow a case by case assessment of individuals. The guidelines must be clarified to ensure that their interpretation does not lead doctors in excluding every person with a chronic condition. CIDA needs to ensure that employees are fully informed of their rights and of the complete posting process, including the medical requirements and the possibility for an employee to seek a third opinion in a timely fashion. The wording of the \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d should be changed to reflect a high medical standard for posting to Afghanistan, while not instituting a complete ban. Evidence showed that CIDA officials were not familiar with HC\u2019s medical assessment process, or the existence of FSD9. The evidence tendered by the respondents did not demonstrate any real knowledge regarding accommodation measures, nor the CHRA. Therefore, the need for training is justified. I simply differ on the length of time to complete the training requested by the Commission. The Commission requested that the training be completed within six months. I disagree. I understand that it is better to set a deadline but I find that a six month delay is unreasonable for such large organizations like CIDA and HC. I am more inclined to say within a reasonable time frame not exceeding a year.\n[182] Therefore, I order the following, in accordance with what was requested by the Commission:\n(a) That HC amend the OHAG to remove any references in the Afghanistan Guidelines to \u201cAbsolute medical requirements\u201d, and to instead adopt an approach that simply lists factors that are to be considered as part of an overall individualized assessment, with an express recognition that no single factor will necessarily be determinative;\n(b) That HC amend its policies, or create a new policy, requiring that in cases where a treating specialist physician provides an opinion on employee fitness that differs from the initial opinion of the OHMO, and HC does not agree with the specialist, HC will:\n(i) consult with the treating specialist to explore the bases for the different opinions;\n(ii) if still not in agreement, promptly offer to send the employee for an independent medical examination by a specialist in the appropriate field;\n(iii) if dissatisfied with the independent specialist, consult with the independent specialist to explore the bases for the different opinions, and\n(iv) ultimately, if no resolution has been reached, place before the employing department full, objective and impartial descriptions of all the recommendations as to fitness rendered by the various physicians who were consulted during the process.\n(c) That HC and CIDA amend their policies, or create a new policy, to clearly state that the CHRA and the \u201cduty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship\u201d must be considered and applied whenever recommendations or decisions are being made with respect to the medical fitness of civilian employees for postings, regardless of where those postings might be;\n(d) That CIDA amend its policies, or create a new policy, so as to put a mechanism in place to ensure that all employees who apply for postings (and for temporary duty assignments, in the case of Afghanistan) are first made aware:\n(i) that all successful candidates will be required to undergo a pre-deployment medical assessment by HC, or by another provider if CIDA deems it appropriate;\n(ii) that if they receive a negative assessment, they will have the right under FSD9 to submit a written opinion from a treating physician to HC which will then provide a reassessment to CIDA, possibly after offering the employee an opportunity to undergo an independent medical examination;\n(iii) that if HC does not request an independent medical opinion, CIDA may itself offer the employee an opportunity to undergo an independent medical examination, the results of which will be provided to HC for further assessment;\n(iv) ultimately, the final decision about whether to put a candidate forward for head of mission concurrence lies with CIDA, and not with HC or any other department.\n(e) That HC provide training to all managers and OHMOs involved in conducting pre-deployment medical assessments on:\n(i) The application of the FSD9 to their work, and\n(ii) The application of the CHRA to their work, including insofar as it relates to legal principles relating to the assessment of health and safety risks as a possible form of undue hardship;\n(f) That CIDA provide training to all managers and staff involved in making decisions about postings and temporary duty assignments on:\n(i) The application of the FSD9 to their work, and\n(ii) The application of the CHRA to their work, including insofar as it relates to the assessment of health and safety risks as a possible form of undue hardship;\n[183] That the steps to be taken under subparagraphs (a) to (f), above, be completed within one year of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n[184] I retain jurisdiction and remain seized of the matter until the parties confirm that the terms of this order, and of any further orders, have been implemented.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 23, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1466\/1210\nStyle of Cause: Bronwyn Cruden v.

Lustig\nDate: September 27, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 14\n[1] This is a Ruling on a Motion by the Complainants requesting the Tribunal to accept for filing their Amended Statement of Particulars dated June 28, 2011 and by the Commission requesting the Tribunal to accept for filing its Amended Statement of Particulars dated July 4, 2011, or alternatively to amend each of the Complaints in this matter and accept for filing its Amended Statement of Particulars.\n[2] The Complainants who are siblings, have each filed Complaints in virtually identical form, signed on November 24, 2008, December 6, 2008 and December 8, 2008 alleging that the denial of status to be registered as an Indian under s. 6 of the Indian Act is a discriminatory practice based both \u201c...upon the prohibited grounds of family status and gender under the Canadian Human Rights Act\u201d (\u201cCHRA\u201d). On the last page of each Complaint, under the heading \u201cProhibited Grounds\u201d, each Complainant states his or her view that the registration provisions of the Indian Act are discriminatory, in that status eligibility would extend farther down their lineage if their Indian grandparent had been male instead of female:\nI believe that the Rule resulting from Bill C-31 is discriminatory towards me and my [siblings\/brothers] based both [sic] the prohibited grounds of family status and gender under the Canadian Human Rights Act in that Bill C-31 continues to distinguish and discriminate against the descendants of Indian women who married non-Indian men by limiting the extension of status to a certain tier of lineage that would not apply to male Indians of the same heritage.\n[3] On November 9, 2009 the Complaints in this matter were referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) to this Tribunal pursuant to ss. 40 (4) and 49 of the CHRA for a single inquiry.\n- The Complainants filed their Statement of Particulars dated February 4, 2010.\n- The Commission filed its Statement of Particulars dated February 9, 2010.\n- The Respondent filed its Statement of Particulars dated March 1, 2010.\n[4] For the purpose of this Ruling it suffices to describe the Complainants\u2019 situation as alleged by them in their and the Commission\u2019s Statements of Particulars as follows:\na) The Complainants were all born before 1985. They have one Indian grandparent: a woman who lost status when she married a non-Indian before 1985, and who regained her status under s. 6 (1) (c) of the Indian Act with the passage of the Bill C-31 amendments in 1985. By virtue of those same amendments, the children of her marriage with a non-Indian man (one of whom was the Complainants\u2019 father, Eugene) were deemed eligible for status under s.6 (2) of the Indian Act. Since the 1985 amendments only gave their father status under s. 6 (2), and since their mother was a non-Indian, the Complainants were not at the time of the filing by them of their Complaints entitled to any status under the Indian Act since s. 6 (2) does not allow a person to pass his or her status to children with non Indians. As a result, the children they have had with non-Indians since 1985 were also not entitled to status.\nb) The Complainants prepared and delivered a chart that sets out their family and status history as compared to a hypothetical family history that is identical in all respects, save for the sex of their Indian grandparent. In other words, in the hypothetical family history, their Indian grandparent is male instead of female. All dates of births, marriages and deaths are consistent in both scenarios. As shown in the chart, the Complainants in the hypothetical patrilineal scenario would at the time of the filing by them of their Complaints have had status under s. 6 (1) of the Indian Act, and would be able to pass s. 6 (2) status to their children while in their real matrilineal scenario they had no status either under s. 6 (1) or under s. 6 (2).\nc) The Complainants alleged that this differential treatment, flowing from discrimination in the Indian Act, had two principal adverse effects: first, they were themselves denied status, and the benefits that flow therefrom; and second, they were being denied the opportunity to pass status to their children.\n[5] On April 6, 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rendered its decision in the matter of McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs) wherein it declared s. 6 (1) (a) and s. 6 (1) (c) of the Indian Act to be of no force or effect as these provisions infringed the plaintiff\u2019s right to equality under s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and that the infringement is not justified by s. 1 of the Charter. The British Columbia Court of Appeal suspended its declaration for a period of one year and subsequently extended the suspension on two occasions - the last of which took place on July 5, 2010 until January 31, 2011, to allow Parliament time to review and consider new amendments to the Indian Act.\n[6] In April and August 2010, the Respondent sought and obtained adjournments of the Tribunal process while Parliament debated Bill C-3 being An Act to promote gender equity in Indian registration by responding to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia decision in McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs).\n[7] Bill C-3 was introduced on March 11, 2010, given Royal Assent on December 15, 2010, and came into effect on January 31, 2011.\n[8] Among other things, Bill C-3 amended the registration provisions by adding a new s. 6 (1) (c.1) to the Indian Act. This subsection creates a new category of s. 6 (1) status for eligible persons whose mothers had lost status by marrying on-Indians before the 1985 amendments. However, the registration provisions of the Indian Act, both before and after the passage of Bill C-3, confer s. 6 (1) status on persons who have the same family history as the Complainants, but whose sole Indian grandparent was a grandfather, rather than a grandmother. Persons with s. 6 (1) status can pass Indian status to the children they have with non-Indians. The registration provisions of the Indian Act, both before and after the passage of Bill C-3, does not grant to the Complainants s. 6 (1) status and as such the Complainants are not able to pass Indian status to the children that they have had, or will have, with a non-Indian.\n[9] After Bill C-3 was given Royal Assent, all three Complainants filed fresh applications with the Office of the Indian Registry, seeking registration. Jeremy Matson also filed an application seeking registration for this daughter, Iris Matson.\n[10] In a letter to Jeremy Matson dated May 9, 2011, the Indian Registrar confirmed that (i) the Complainants\u2019 father, Eugene Matson, was now entitled to be registered under the new s. 6 (1) (c.1), rather than s. 6 (2), (ii) Jeremy Matson was therefore now eligible for status under s. 6 (2), as the child of one Indian parent, and (iii) Jeremy Matson was therefore registered under the Indian Act as of May 9, 2011. The letter further stated that the Squamish Nation, to which Jeremy Matson traces his ancestry, is one of the bands that has chosen since the 1985 amendments to control its own band membership.\n[11] By emails dated June 13 and 14, 2011, Mardy Matson and Melody Schneider advised the Commission that their applications had also been approved, and that they too had been found eligible for s. 6 (2) status, and registered as Indians.\n[12] By letter to Jeremy Matson dated May 20, 2011, the Indian Registrar denied the registration application that he had filed on behalf of his daughter, Iris Matson. The letter states that while Bill C-3 had changed the status entitlement of Jeremy Matson\u2019s father (i.e. Eugene Matson), it had not changed the status entitlement of his daughter (ie. Iris Matson), who remains ineligible.\n[13] As a result of the matters outlined in paragraphs No. 7 to 12 inclusive, the Complainants and the Commission decided to file Amended Statements of Particulars dated June 28, 2011 and July 4, 2011 (the \u201cAmended Particulars\u201d) respectively in order to continue with the Complaints with what they deemed to be necessary changes to reflect the fact that Bill C-3 provided them with s. 6 (2) status without the right to pass status to their children with non-Indians but did not provide them with s. 6 (1) status under the Indian Act, as would have been the case in their hypothetical comparative paralineal scenario both before and after the passing of Bill C-3 under which they could have passed status to their children with non-Indians.\n[14] At the case conference meeting held before me with the parties on July 11, 2011, the Respondent indicated that it was objecting to the Tribunal accepting the Amended Statements of Particulars of the Complainants and the Commission. I directed the Complainants and the Commission to file Notices of Motion requesting the acceptance of the filing of their Amendments to the Statements of Particulars. The Commission filed its Motion and submissions on August 11, 2011, the Complainants filed their Motion and submissions on August 15, 2011, the Respondent filed its Motion\u2019s Brief in response on August 29, 2011, the Commission filed its Reply to the Motion\u2019s Brief on September 1, 2011 and the Complainants filed their Reply to the Motion\u2019s Brief on September 3, 2011.\n[15] Based upon the facts as they see them, the Commission\u2019s and the Complainants\u2019 submissions, in support of their motions, are as follows:\na) The Tribunal has the legislative authority to order that the Amended Particulars be accepted for filing, and\/or to order that the complaints be amended, if necessary.\nb) Human rights complaints are not to be too narrowly or technically perused and interpreted and the Tribunal process is not strictly bound by the four corners of the initial complaint form.\nc) It is the Statement of Particulars that sets the precise terms of a hearing, not the complaint form.\nd) The essence of the Complaints in this case is exactly the same as the substance of the allegations in the Amended Particulars, namely, that the registration provisions of the Indian Act discriminate on the basis of sex and\/or family status because they allow Indian status to be transmitted further in a family descended from an Indian grandfather, as compared to a family that is descended from an Indian grandmother, but is otherwise alike in all respects.\ne) The Amended Particulars do not raise any new allegations. To the extent that they acknowledge the conferral of status on the Complainants post-Bill C-3, and emphasize the continuing differential treatment with respect to their ability to pass status to their children, the Amended Particulars simply clarify and make explicit the current legalities of the general situation that was already raised in the original complaints.\nf) The Amended Particulars properly put all parties on notice of the issues arising from the original complaints, and they serve their intended function of setting the terms of the hearing.\ng) Accepting the Amended Particulars for filing would not cause any prejudice to the parties. The Respondent has known about the issue with respect to the status of children for some time.\nh) Requiring the additional formal step of amending the Complaints would run contrary to directions that the Tribunal conduct its proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedural fairness allow.\ni) Alternatively, if amendments to the Complaints are required prior to accepting the Amended Particulars, the Tribunal has the authority to accept amended Complaints since they respect the substance of the original Complaint, do not result in prejudice to the opposing party and do not seek to raise allegations that plainly and obviously cannot succeed. The amendments have their \u201cpedigree\u201d in the circumstances that were put before the Commission in the Complaint and do not raise a \u201cnew\u201d complaint that is legally or factually unconnected to the original Complaint.\n[16] Based upon the facts as it sees them, the Respondent\u2019s submissions in opposition to the Commission and Complainant\u2019s submissions in summary, are as follows:\na) The Statement of Particulars cannot create a new complaint but is outlined by the language and allegations in the Complaint Form.\nb) As the Complaint Forms lack particularity, it is not fair game for the Statement of Particulars to create a new basis for a complaint that was not particularized.\nc) The proposed amendments have the effect of creating entirely new issues, namely, the legislation under which registration is occurring and the individuals who may be impacted by same.\nd) The proposed amendments to the Complaints are not appropriate as they do not have a \u201cpedigree\u201d in the original Complaint and are essentially a new complaint that was not the subject of the investigation by the Commission and referred to the Tribunal.\ne) The Complainants Complaints are now mooted by virtue of their registrations under s. 6 (2) of the Indian Act and should be dismissed.\nf) The proposed amendments to the Statements of Particulars and\/or the original Complaint Forms represent such a fundamental change to the initial referral that they are outside the framework of the CHRA.\ng) New Complaints ought to be started anew with a new process before the Commission.\n[17] In my opinion, the Amended Particulars are acceptable for filing in this matter. The Complaint, in its essence, has not changed, however, the legislation has changed. Prior to the enactment of Bill C-3 when the Complainants filed their Complaints, they had no status for registration under s.6 of the Indian Act. Their Complaints, without particularizing this in terms of either s. 6 (1) or s. 6 (2) of the Indian Act, were directed to the inequity that they felt existed vis-a-vis status as between them and their comparators in the theoretical patrilineal scenario who had s. 6 (1) status with the right to pass status on to their children with non-Indians. It is not surprising that they did not specify s. 6 (1) or s. 6 (2) of the Indian Act, given the more general nature of a Complaint Form, the fact that they are not lawyers and the likelihood, in my opinion, that they simply expected their Complaints to cover the entire difference between them and their theoretical comparators. They would not have known then that Bill C-3 would be passed without the amendments that would give them the same s. 6 (1) status as their theoretical comparators.\n[18] Following the enactment of Bill C-3 and the Complainants registrations under s. 6 (2) of the Indian Act it has become appropriate that the Amended Particulars be submitted and filed given current circumstances. This should neither be surprising to the Respondent nor does it raise anything that is essentially new in my opinion. There is a reasonable and logical nexus between the Complaints and the Amended Particulars. In my opinion it would be a waste of time and resources and not in the public interest to have the Complainants return to the Commission with new Complaints in these circumstances.\n[19] The Amended Particulars will bring this case up to date so that it can properly proceed. The Complainants Complaints respecting their own registration under the Indian Act are now moot since the Complainants have now been registered, however, the part of their Complaints that, in my opinion, implicitly related to the opportunity to pass this status on to any children with non-Indians, as exists currently for their theoretical comparators, is still live.\n[20] In the result, I hereby Order that the Amended Particulars be accepted for filing.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

TETTAUT, ANNA MALEC, GERMAINE MEST\u00c9NAP\u00c9O, ESTELLE KALTUSH Complainants - and - CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION Commission - and - CONSEIL DES MONTAGNAIS DE NATASHQUAN Respondent DECISION ON REQUEST MEMBER: Shirish P. Chotalia, Q.C. 2011 CHRT 15 Tribunal Chairperson 2011\/09\/29\n[1] The issue in this case arises from the decision in Conseil des montagnais de Natashquan v. Malec, 2010 FC 1325, rendered on December 23, 2010, in which the Honourable Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer found that the Tribunal erred when it determined that there was no evidence on the record justifying the prima facie discriminatory policy of the Conseil des montagnais de Natashquan (the Conseil). For that reason, the judge allowed the application for judicial review and referred the file back to the Tribunal for a new hearing. Her judgment reads as follows: THE COURT ORDERS that the application for judicial review be allowed, that the decision be set aside and the matter be referred back to a member or panel of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for redetermination in accordance with these reasons. With costs. (Emphasis added) [2] The judge therefore did not specify whether the same panel or a differently constituted panel should have the burden of redetermining the matter. Thus, I must determine whether it is appropriate, in light of the objections made by the respondents, to assign the file to member Doucet again so that he may decide on the matter in accordance with the reasons of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer. [3] The respondents maintain that the impartiality rule as well as the nemo judex in sua causa rule dictate that a different member must be assigned to this case, failing which, member Doucet may create a reasonable apprehension of bias. In fact, according to the respondents, by reviewing his own decision, he would probably be led to confirm it. If I were to reject this motion, the respondents alternatively submit that member Doucet should recuse himself. [4] The issue of apprehension of bias raised when a judge is called on to redetermine a matter that he or she already decided on has been widely examined by the courts. The case law on this subject is unequivocal: a judge who has already made a ruling on certain aspects of a case may again make a ruling in a proceeding arising from the same case, provided that the situation does not as such create bias or the appearance of bias: R. v. Perciballi, [2001] O.J. No. 1712 at para. 2. (See Barthe v. The Queen, [1964] 41 C.R. 47; Ahani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1114 at para. 7; Nord-Deutsche Versicherungs Gesellschaft et al.\n2 v. The Queen et al., [1968] 1 Ex.C.R. 443 (Nord-deutsche Versicherungs Gesellschaft); Charkaoui (re), 2004 FC 624 at paras. 5 to 8 (Charkaoui) and Ianvarashvili c. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 695 at para. 9. [5] The application of this principle in the administrative context was examined by Donald J. M. Brown and John M. Evans in their work \"Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada\" loose-leaf edition (Toronto, Canvasback, 2003). The Honourable Mr. Justice Rothstein cited paragraph 12:6320 of this work in Gale v. Canada (Treasury Board), 2004 FCA 13. It reads as follows: When the tribunal reconsiders a matter either on its own motion or following judicial review it must, of course, comply with the duty of fairness. . . . And unless a court orders otherwise, while the same persons who decided the matter on the first occasion may normally also rehear it, they should not do so where they were earlier disqualified for bias, or if for any reason, there is a reasonable apprehension that the original decision-maker is not likely to determine the matter objectively. [6] Thus, there is a presumption that a member, such as member Doucet in this case, will comply with the duty to act fairly and that he or she is able to rehear a matter unless there is a reasonable apprehension of bias (see S.I.D.M. v. British Columbia Maritime Employers Association, [1987] 81 N.R. 237, at para. 6 (F.C.A.); Deigan v. Canada (Industry), [2000] 258 N.R. 103, at para. 3 (F.C.A.)). Based on that criterion, as it was established in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Office), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at p. 394 (Committee for Justice and Liberty), it must be determined what . . . an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically \u2013 and having thought the matter through \u2013 [would] conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that the member Doucet, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly? [7] The burden to demonstrate bias is on the person who is relying on it: R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para. 114 and Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24 at para. 26. It is therefore for the respondents to demonstrate that member Doucet would not be impartial if he had to rehear this matter.\n3 [8] The respondents claim that member Doucet would not be impartial because of the simple fact that he had already decided on the issue. However, the case law cited above is clear that there is a presumption of impartiality with regard to members, and, in my opinion, the respondents\u2019 argument is far from demonstrating that there is a serious and unequivocal apprehension of bias: Arthur v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (C.A.), [1993] 1 F.C. 940 at para. 8 and Committee for Justice and Liberty at para. 41. [9] In addition, the respondents are basing their position on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Newfoundland Telephone Co. v. Newfoundland (Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 623 (Newfoundland Telephone). In that case, when a matter the hearing for which was still in progress was before a commissioner, he made some public statements, which, to a reasonable observer, would have seemed to indicate that he had already made his decision before the Board had even heard all of the evidence. The Supreme Court of Canada found in that context that there was sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable apprehension of bias and that any order of the Board had to become void. [10] However, the facts of this case are nothing like those in Newfoundland Telephone. Indeed, none of the parties has alleged that member Doucet had said anything or acted in a way that would raise a reasonable apprehension of bias inside or outside the courtroom. Consequently, apart from the fact that it stresses one more time the importance of the impartiality rule, I do not believe that Newfoundland Telephone is useful to us in this case. [11] In my view, the facts in Gale (cited above) are more similar to the facts of this case. In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal decided that not only did the fact that the adjudicator had failed to consider some of the evidence before making his decision not raise an apprehension of bias but, on the contrary, it put the adjudicator in a better position to assess the impact of the evidence at issue on his decision: Gale at paras. 18 and 19. Although in that case one of the parties had to but had not yet submitted a piece of evidence to the adjudicator, and in this case the evidence in question was before member Doucet, the main facts are the same: a failure of the adjudicator or\n4 member to consider some of the evidence does not in itself create a reasonable apprehension of bias. [12] In light of this analysis, I find that the respondents did not provide the evidence necessary to displace the presumption of integrity and impartiality enjoyed by member Doucet. In addition, judicial efficiency as well as the member\u2019s previous knowledge of the file (see Nord-Deutsche Versicherungs Gesellschaft at p. 458), militate in favour of the file being assigned to him so that he may redetermine it in light of the reasons of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer. [13] For these reasons, I assign the file to member Doucet and give him the discretion to determine his own procedure. He will then be able to decide on other issues raised by the parties, namely, whether he should recuse himself, whether a new hearing is needed and whether the Canadian Human Rights Commission should participate.

Complaint & Motion. 1\nII........... Positions of the Parties. 2\nIII......... Ruling. 6\nI. Complaint & Motion [1] The complainant, Mr. Ashok Tiwari, is a Customer service agent at Air Canada. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on September 14, 2009, on the ground of age within the meaning of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA). Specifically, the complainant alleges that the respondents, his employer, Air Canada, and his union, the Canadian Auto Workers-Canada Union (CAW), engaged in a discriminatory practice when his employment was to be terminated on the first day of the month after the month in which he turned age 65, on September 8, 2009, according to the mandatory retirement policy in the collective agreement. On August 12, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the CHRA, the Commission requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) inquire into this complaint.\n[2] On March 3 2011, the complainant filed a motion seeking a ruling on the three following matters:\n1) That the Tribunal make a finding that a prima facie case of discrimination has been made out against the respondents by reason of the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment on the basis of age, contrary to the provisions of the CHRA;\n2) That the Tribunal rule that it is bound by the Federal Court decision in Air Canada Pilots Association v. Kelly, 2011 FC 120 [Kelly], and make a finding that section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is not available to the respondents as a defense to the alleged contravention of the CHRA; and,\n3) That the Tribunal rule that the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment constitutes a discriminatory practice in the absence of any other defense raised by the respondents in respect of the prima facie case of discrimination.\nII. Positions of the Parties [3] The complainant\u2019s position in sum is as follows:\n(a) The parties to this proceeding agree that the sole reason for the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment is the mandatory retirement provision of the collective agreement in force between the respondents.\n(b) The Federal Court in the Kelly decision and in Vilven v. Air Canada, 2009 FC 367, determined that section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA violates section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [the Charter] and is not saved by section 1 of the Charter; that determination is binding upon the Tribunal.\n(c) Re-litigation of the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA before this Tribunal would constitute an abuse of process and could have significant adverse consequences on the integrity of the judicial system and the administration of justice.\n(d) The interests of justice and the balance of convenience favor the Tribunal predetermining the availability of the section 15(1)(c) defense in the circumstances in this case.\n(e) CAW did not make a formal motion to adjourn the proceedings therefore, is not properly before the Tribunal.\n(f) Air Canada did not oppose the complainant\u2019s allegation that section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is unconstitutional and Air Canada stated that it did not plan on adducing evidence on the issue.\n(g) The complainant concedes any defense on the merits of section 15(1)(c) and pleads only that because of the constitutional invalidity of the section, that defense is not available to Air Canada. The motion seeks only to foreclose re-litigation of the constitutional issue.\n(h) There is no requirement for a general declaration of invalidity that a statutory provision is of no force and no effect for this determination to be binding upon the Tribunal.\n(i) There is no legal requirement or valid reason for suspending the operation of this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear and decide similar cases in respect of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA until all appeals of the Kelly decision have been exhausted, indeed there are strong statutory and constitutional reasons for not doing so.\n(j) Air Canada has failed twice to persuade this Tribunal and the Federal Court of the complainant\u2019s allegation that section 15(1)(c) is of no force and no effect.\n(k) Neither of the respondents deny the complainant\u2019s assertion of the constitutional invalidity of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA in the circumstances of this case; they only assert the decision is non-binding.\n(l) Air Canada does not contemplate calling any witnesses with respect to the constitutionality of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA. Air Canada in its pleadings has already determined the conclusion of the constitutional issue. Absent any supervening superior court authority for the Tribunal to interfere with the determination made by the way of the parties pleadings, absent any authority for the Tribunal to address both respondent\u2019s not to plead, not to provide evidence and not to argue against the complainant\u2019s assertion of the constitutional invalidity of section 15(1)(c), the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider or permit a defense under 15(1)(c).\n(m) The Tribunal ought to expedite its proceedings by concluding, in consideration of all the arguments put forward by the complainant, that absent any valid reason to do otherwise, it must follow the prior determinations of the Tribunal and the Court in respect of the central question before it with respect to the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c) and conclude its deliberation of the issue of liability without convening an unnecessary hearing.\n[4] Air Canada\u2019s position is that the Tribunal should dismiss the complainant\u2019s motion for the following reasons:\n(a) Air Canada has a fundamental right to present a full defense under section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\n(b) They are entitled to rely upon section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA because, contrary to the position advanced by the complainant, Air Canada still has an available defense.\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Vilven v. Air Canada, 2009 CHRT 24, and the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Kelly, did not provide for a general declaration of invalidity of section 15(1)(c).\n(d) In respect of the Charter, in Kelly, it was only applied to the two pilots involved in the case.\n(e) Mandatory retirement is and continues to be permitted under the CHRA.\n(f) In the absence of a successful constitutional challenge of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, raised in the context of the present complaint, it is entirely open and appropriate for Air Canada to rely upon section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA as a defense. The Tribunal is free to entertain a defense based on the normal age of retirement in relation to mandatory retirement at age 65 for Customer Sales and Service Agents represented by the CAW.\n(g) Air Canada is therefore entitled to rely upon and argue the normal age of retirement defense as it did in two previous complaints that were dismissed by the Commission before they were referred to this Tribunal.\n(h) Air Canada contends the Federal Court decision in Kelly is currently under appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal. The conclusion on section 15 of the CHRA and section 1 of the Charter of this Tribunal is subject to review.\n(i) The complainant cannot simply rely upon the Kelly decision in order to conclude that the findings in that decision support a conclusion of prima facie discrimination in the present case.\n(j) Fairness dictates that the respondents be provided with an opportunity to make a full defense.\n(k) The respondents are not attempting to re-litigate an issue already resolved by the Courts.\n(l) The complainant will not suffer a prejudice if the motion is dismissed since the complainant has been reinstated in his previous employment and will not suffer ongoing damages.\n[5] The CAW\u2019s position is the Tribunal should dismiss the motion for the following reasons:\n(a) The complainant appears to rely on the Federal Court ruling in Kelly, pertaining to the validity of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, as the final word of the Courts of Canada upon this issue when clearly it is not.\n(b) The Federal Court did not issue a general declaration to the effect that section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is void and of no effect pursuant to section 52(1) of the Charter.\n(c) The CAW on behalf of the complainant and others, filed a grievance and a decision was made by Arbitrator Martin Teplitsky declaring void and contrary to the law any rule relating to mandatory retirement at age 65 for CAW bargaining unit employees subject to a final judgment from the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the Kelly decision. The Arbitrator ordered re-hiring employees and reinstatement of employees that were terminated because of reaching age 65, including the complainant.\n(d) In respect of the doctrine of stare decisis, that the Tribunal is bound by the Federal Court decision in Kelly in the absence of a section 52(1) declaration of constitutionality invalidity is a moot point. CAW acted upon the decision of the Federal Court and filed a grievance on behalf of the complainant and obtained an order reinstating him pending the final outcome of the decision at the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.\n(e) CAW wish to proceed in the most cost-effective and practical way and asks that the Tribunal adjourn these proceedings pending the appeal of the Kelly decision to the Federal Court of Appeal and\/or the Supreme Court of Canada.\n(f) The only issue is the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\n(g) The complainant will suffer no prejudice since he will be at work pending the final outcome of the matter.\n(h) CAW should not pay for damages until the law is finally clarified.\nIII. Ruling [6] Pursuant to section 50(2) of the CHRA, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider and apply the Charter and provide remedies for breaches thereof in accordance with its powers under the CHRA (see R v. Conway, 2010 SCC 22). However, no provision in the CHRA grants the Tribunal jurisdiction to issue a general declaration concerning the constitutionality of a statutory provision that would apply to all future cases. In Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54 [Martin], the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\nIn addition, the constitutional remedies available to administrative tribunals are limited and do not include general declarations of invalidity. A determination by a tribunal that a provision of its enabling statute is invalid pursuant to the Charter is not binding on future decision makers, within or outside the tribunal\u2019s administrative scheme. Only by obtaining a formal declaration of invalidity by a court can a litigant establish the general invalidity of a legislative provision for all future cases.\n(Martin at para. 31)\n[7] These principles were also stated by the Tribunal in Vilven v. Air Canada, 2010 CHRT 27 at para. 6, and by the Federal Court in the Kelly decision at para. 479. Therefore, the Tribunal must take a case by case approach to considering and applying the Charter and it would not be an abuse of process or re-litigation of the Tribunal\u2019s previous decision to consider the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA within the context of the present case. While the facts in the present case are similar to those in the Kelly decision, the parties are not the same and Mr. Tiwari is a Customer service agent employee, not a pilot. Therefore, a hearing on the merits and factual evidence must be adduced for the Tribunal to make a finding regarding the constitutional validity of section 15(1)(c) in this case.\n[8] The complainant asks the Tribunal to accept his position on the constitutional invalidity of section 15(1)(c) based on the documents filed, such as the statements of particulars. The complainant adds that Air Canada did not oppose the complainant\u2019s allegation of unconstitutionality and it did not plan on adducing evidence on the issue. I do not agree with this argument. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to perform a second screening of the complaint resembling that of the Commission. The following is instructive:\nIt is true that in Cremasco et al. v. Canada Post Corporation, Ruling No. I, 2002\/09\/30 (aff'd: Canada (Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 (CanLII), 2004 FC 81), the Federal Court affirmed the Tribunal's power, as master of its own procedures, to prevent abuse of those procedures by dismissing a case that was eight years old and had already been subject to two arbitrations and a separate complaint to the Commission (Cremasco, at para. 14). However, the Court's affirmation of the Tribunal's decision in those circumstances does not lead to a conclusion that it has the jurisdiction to dismiss complaints on the grounds that the Statement of Particulars fails to disclose a prima facie case. In my view, if Parliament had intended the Tribunal to exercise what would essentially be a second screening function following the Commission's initial decision under s. 41(1)(d), it would have provided express statutory authority to do so.\n(Harkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 CHRT 6 [Harkin] at para. 21, emphasis added).\n[9] Statements of particulars and pleadings should not be considered the only evidence presented to make a party\u2019s case. At a hearing, parties may bring forward witnesses and make other arguments that further explain what they have briefly laid out in their statement of particulars. Full disclosure of documents ensures neither party is caught by surprise at the hearing, but it is not the parties\u2019 final word. The hearing is also an opportunity for the presiding member to ask questions and to observe and hear witnesses. Ultimately, the Tribunal must ensure that all the parties have had an opportunity to be heard in a fair and impartial manner. As the Tribunal stated in Harkin:\nIt must also be borne in mind that s. 50(1) provides the parties with a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and argument on the matters raised in the complaint. Granted, Justice von Finckenstein in Cremasco stated that where it is apparent that the parties have, in fact, been heard in another forum, the Tribunal is permitted to dismiss the complaint without a hearing. However, the Tribunal exercises great caution in dismissing complaints on that basis (Telecommunications Employees' Association of Manitoba Inc. et al v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 26; O'Connor v. Canadian National Railway 2006 CHRT 05); it must be clear that the parties have truly been heard and the issues conclusively resolved in the other forum.\n(Harkin at para. 22)\n[10] Furthermore, in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, Assembly of First Nations v. Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2011 CHRT 4 [AFN], the Tribunal stated:\nThe instruction in s. 48.9(2) of the CHRA to proceed with informality and expedition is subject to two important limits: the principles of natural justice and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, May 3rd, 2004 (Rules of Procedure).\n(AFN at para. 33)\n[11] Air Canada wants to present a full defense and is entitled to according to the principles of natural justice and fairness and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure. In this regard, the complainant must respect the choice of procedure that the Tribunal has put in place:\nFinally, one must consider the choices of procedure made by the Tribunal itself, particularly when the Act leaves to the Tribunal the ability to choose its own procedures, and further where the Tribunal has an expertise in determining what procedures are appropriate in the circumstances. Regarding the latter, Members of the Tribunal are appointed for their expertise, experience and sensitivity to human rights (CHRA, s. 48.1(2)). Moreover, where a case proceeds to a viva voce hearing it is noteworthy that Parliament has expressly entrusted the Members with the authority to decide any procedural question arising therein (CHRA, s. 50(3)(e)).\n(AFN at para. 48)\n[12] The Tribunal has instituted new initiatives that may help the parties in expediting their case in a cost-efficient manner. These initiatives are designed to achieve access to justice within the parameters of natural justice. There are many proactive ways to deal with the matters in this case without preventing the respondents from presenting their case. Through active case management, issues can be narrowed to shorten the hearing. Facts, issues and questions of law may be agreed and filed as such. Process mediation with the assistance of a Member of the Tribunal may be an alternative to prepare for the hearing. These are all examples of ways, if parties agree, in which they may use their resources in an efficient manner without denying the respondents the defense they want to bring forward.\n[13] The CAW wants an adjournment but did not make a formal motion to adjourn; therefore, I do not consider it a live issue in the present motion.\n[14] The complainant has not convinced me that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant the motion he requests.\n[15] For these reasons, the motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 7, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1506\/5210 & T1507\/5310\nStyle of Cause: Ashok Tiwari v.

Garfield\nDate: October 14, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 17\nIntroduction\n[1] These are my Reasons for Ruling on two motions brought by all of the Hall-represented Complainants (calling themselves the \u201cCoalition Complainants\u201d) at the time the Notice of Motion was filed, regarding the Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) of the two Respondents \u2013 Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cACPA\u201d).\nMain Proceeding\n[2] By way of context, the main proceeding involves the Complaints of retired Air Canada pilots who claim that Air Canada engaged in a discriminatory practice and applied a discriminatory policy by requiring them to retire at the age of 60. This was pursuant to the collective agreement negotiated between Air Canada and the bargaining agent, ACPA, and the pilots\u2019 pension plan. As a result, companion Complaints have been filed by these retired pilots against ACPA, and have been combined into a single hearing by the Tribunal. The pilots claim that requiring them to retire at age 60 was in violation of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[3] At the first Case Management Conference, on consent of the parties, I bifurcated the proceeding into a liability and remedy stage. As of the date of these Reasons, other complaints of retired Air Canada pilots involving the same issues have been referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) to the Tribunal. The Chair of the Tribunal has assigned those complaints to me. There is now a total of 164 complaints (82 complainants) in the cluster of complaints cited as \u201cBailie et al.\u201d They are all represented by counsel Raymond D. Hall (also a Complainant), except for one self-represented Complainant, Eric Rogers.\nMotion Re: Air Canada's Statement of Particulars\n[4] The Coalition Complainants seek an Order requiring Air Canada to serve and file \u201cfurther and better particulars\u201d with regard to its bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d) defence, including the \u201caccommodation to the point of undue hardship\u201d component. This request includes a \u201cdetailed description\u201d of the evidence the Respondent intends to rely upon.\n[5] In the alternative, if Air Canada is unable to establish in its Response to the motion \u201cin law and in proposed evidence\u201d a defence that established the BFOR defence, the Complainants ask that I strike out all paragraphs of Air Canada\u2019s SOP related to a BFOR defence.\n[6] The Coalition Complainants also seek an Order striking out twelve other paragraphs of Air Canada\u2019s SOP, specifically paras. 19-20, 37-38, 40 and 48-54. Some of those paragraphs relate to Air Canada\u2019s BFOR defence, others to facts unrelated to the BFOR defence. The moving parties add the proviso \u201cthat Air Canada be permitted to restate any purported defence\u2026provided that the defence is pleaded with a sufficient degree of specificity\u2026\u201d\nGrounds of the Motion\n[7] Extensive materials on the motion have been filed. Below is my paraphrasing and condensing of the grounds and argument to its core.\n[8] The moving parties assert that Air Canada has misstated throughout its SOP the central issue before the Tribunal as being the abolition of mandatory retirement at age 60 for its pilots. \u201cThe only issue that is before this Tribunal is whether the termination of employment of each respective Complainant constituted a discriminatory practice as of the date of each Complainant\u2019s termination of employment.\u201d Not only does Air Canada\u2019s SOP misstate the issues in dispute, the Coalition Complainants also claim Air Canada is attempting \u201cto bring into evidence and argument issues that are totally irrelevant to any issue in dispute in this proceeding.\u201d Much of this centres around the characterization of the BFOR defence.\n[9] Regarding striking out paras. 19-20, 37-38, 40 and 48-54, the moving parties argue that the information contained therein bears no relationship to any issue before the Tribunal and\/or is moot. Such evidence\/argument \u201cwould result in a waste of scarce, valuable Tribunal resources and would constitute an abuse of process.\u201d\nAir Canada\u2019s Response\n[10] Air Canada submits that the motion should be dismissed. However, if I were to find merit to the moving parties\u2019 request, then I should order further particulars, rather than the \u201cexcessive relief\u201d of striking out those parts of the SOP and thus preventing Air Canada from providing a full answer and defence to the Complaints.\n[11] Air Canada argues that it has clearly informed the other parties of its defences, including the nature of the evidence on which it intends to rely. The moving parties improperly seek further details of evidence required at this stage of the proceeding. Regarding the BFOR defence, Air Canada states that it has complied fully with the requirements of the SOP pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[12] Air Canada submits that the moving parties are improperly expecting it \u201cto present in advance of the hearing all of the evidence which will be adduced at that time.\u201d The Complainants\u2019 motion is not properly one of further particulars, \u201cbut is a challenge [to] the credibility of the facts themselves. Such challenges are to be addressed in the hearing when both sides can test each others\u2019 evidence and make submissions as to its credibility.\u201d\n[13] Furthermore, the Respondent states that this is the third Tribunal panel to deal with the mandatory retirement policy for Air Canada pilots. Indeed, two panels have recently rendered Decisions: Vilven\/Kelly, 2011 CHRT 10 and Thwaites, 2011 CHRT 11 (judicial review of both Decisions pending). Earlier Decisions have been reviewed by the Federal Court too. There are currently judicial review applications before the Federal Court and an appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal. Air Canada also points out that the Coalition Complainants have been represented by the same counsel as the Complainants in the other Air Canada pilots mandatory retirement cases before the Tribunal (and the courts on review and appeal). There are no surprises from Air Canada\u2019s SOP.\nAnalysis\nProviding Better Particulars: Purpose and Scope of the SOP\n[14] Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure deals with the Statement of Particulars, disclosure and production. It states that each party\u2019s SOP shall include:\n(1) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case;\n(2) its position on the legal issues raised by the case;\n(3) the relief that it seek;\n(4) a list of all documents, privileged and otherwise; and\n(5) a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call (other than experts) with a summary of anticipated evidence (or \u201cwill-say\u201d).\nSub-rule 6(4) requires the parties to produce a copy of the documents to each other, but not file them with the Tribunal. Sub-rule 6(5) imposes a continuing, ongoing duty of disclosure and production on the parties.\n[15] What is the purpose of the foregoing? It is to allow each of the parties to effectively run their respective cases, and to assist the Tribunal in effectively case-managing the matter to a fair and efficient hearing, negating the need for adjournments due to \u201csurprises\u201d. The SOP is more extensive than pleadings in civil matters before the courts. It requires not just what one would find in a Statement of Claim\/Defence in the civil courts, but also, a list of documents (similar to an Affidavit of Documents), list of witnesses and will-says. The SOP requires the pleading of material facts, not the pleading of evidence. The SOP is not meant to be a factum. Indeed, the will-says do not require the verbatim proposed testimony of a witness, but rather, the main issues to be covered by the witness, so that the other party can prepare its cross-examination and general case.\nWhat Has Been Disclosed\/Produced To Date?\n[16] There has been extensive disclosure\/production to date. First, the parties have filed their SOPs. I understand that there are some issues of outstanding disclosure of documents and productions thereof. The Commission has served and filed its extensive 45-page \u201cdisclosure package\u201d of the \u201cfruits of its investigation\u201d. List of witnesses have been provided to varying degrees and \u201cwill-says\u201d remain outstanding. And of course, the Tribunal does not receive a copy of productions. Any outstanding disclosure\/production issues will be addressed at the upcoming Case Management Conference in Ottawa.\n[17] This motion must be understood in the broader context of the previous Air Canada pilots mandatory retirement cases before the Tribunal and the past and present judicial review applications\/appeals thereof before the courts. Part of the disclosure\/production herein includes the voluminous pre-hearing productions and the viva voce and documentary evidence, as well as argument, at the hearings in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites cases before the Tribunal. As well, there are the materials filed in two completed judicial review applications to the Federal Court including Judgments thereof and current judicial review applications and an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[18] Furthermore, as Air Canada points out, the moving parties\u2019 counsel, Mr. Hall was also counsel in the previous similar cases before the Tribunal and the courts. There is significant overlap in issues and evidence: the Coalition Complainants refer in their SOP at p. 18 to \u201cthe two prior identical hearings.\u201d Indeed, their SOP reads at para. 13: \u201cWith respect to the liability portion of the hearing, the Complainants expect to rely on the evidence and argument adduced in both the Vilven-Kelly hearing and the Thwaites hearing.\u201d\n[19] Air Canada asserts that Mr. Hall and the rest of the moving parties cannot claim \u201csurprise\u201d or \u201cambush\u201d of any kind. Air Canada\u2019s position has not changed. I agree. I have read the 15-page SOP of Air Canada and its reiteration of its particulars in its responding motion materials. I am satisfied that the moving parties have sufficient information to prepare their prima facie case and respond to Air Canada\u2019s BFOR defence. They do not require further and better particulars. As a result, the moving parties\u2019 motion for further and better particulars is dismissed. Consequently, I need not determine their alternative claim to strike out those parts of Air Canada\u2019s SOP dealing with the BFOR defence. However, that still leaves their claim for relief in para. 3 of their Notice of Motion: i.e., to strike out paras. 19-20, 37-38, 40 and 48-54 of Air Canada\u2019s SOP.\nStriking Pleadings: Statutory Provisions and Case Law\n[20] The CHRA and the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure do not expressly provide for the striking of our version of a pleading \u2013 the SOP. Indeed, the Tribunal in Harkin v. Attorney General, 2009 CHRT 6 found that the Tribunal is not authorized to do so, and that the striking of pleadings does not fall within the narrow pre-hearing dismissal category enumerated by von Finckenstein J. in Canada (Human Rights Comm.) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 (\u201cCremasco\u201d). Harkin, supra involved a respondent moving to strike the pleading for failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In the instant motion, the moving parties are complainants and of course are not seeking the striking of part of the pleading for failure to establish a prima facie case. In Harkin the Tribunal found in the alternative that the facts in that case did not even meet the civil courts\u2019 \u201cplain and obvious\u201d test as stated in Hunt v. Carey, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959.\n[21] The Chair of the Tribunal in FNCFCS et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2011 CHRT 4 (judicial review pending), while determining that Cremasco, supra did not set out an exhaustive list for the pre-hearing dismissal of complaints, also cautioned at para. 60 with regards to the Hunt v. Carey \u201cplain and obvious test\u201d: \u201cI agree with the Crown that it is not appropriate to import such tests from the civil courts, which have a very different legal foundation, into the legal scheme of the CHRA.\u201d I agree that the Tribunal should exercise caution when considering whether to import such tests.\n[22] Perhaps the Tribunal should consider the legal tests and practices before other human rights tribunals in Canada before resorting to the courts\u2019. There are strong policy reasons why the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure contain only ten rules, whereas the Federal Courts Rules are over 500 in number. Notably, there is also a statutory basis as subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides: \u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d (See also Rule 1(1)(c)).\n[23] Consistent with the approach taken by the Tribunal in Harkin, supra in the alternative, I will consider now whether the \u201cplain and obvious test\u201d has been established in the instant motion with regards to the motion to strike those twelve paragraphs of Air Canada\u2019s SOP, as set out in para. 3 of the Notice of Motion. Some of those paragraphs relate to Air Canada\u2019s BFOR defence, others are facts providing background and contextual history to the mandatory retirement of pilots issue and employment conditions of Air Canada pilots. I have reviewed those specific sections and find that they meet the low threshhold required to be properly included in a SOP.\n[24] As for the moving parties\u2019 assertion that those paragraphs \u201cwould result in a waste of scarce, valuable Tribunal resources and would constitute an abuse of process,\u201d that raises the broader question of the proceeding as a whole. This motion is not the appropriate vehicle to deal with the abuse of process argument, in a piece-meal fashion, with regards to those paragraphs in Air Canada\u2019s SOP.\nIf anything, based on the comments made by the parties in their respective SOPs and\/or motion materials, there is an arguable issue about the re-litigation of issues in this entire proceeding, invoking the doctrines of res judicata, issue estoppel, abuse of process, etc. For example, page 11 of the moving parties\u2019 Notice of Motion reads in part:\n[25] The issues in this proceeding are largely similar, if not identical to the issues that the Tribunal heard in the Vilven-Kelly hearing, and in the Thwaites hearing. Were it not for the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in the Thwaites hearing has yet to be rendered by the Tribunal [it has since been released: 2011 CHRT 11], it would be correct to say that all of the issues in this proceeding have already been heard and decided before the Tribunal, and this hearing might not be required at all.\n[26] The parties were asked if they intended to bring a motion to dismiss for abuse of process. The Coalition Complainants indicated that they would await the Ruling herein before making their decision. The Commission stated it would not \u201cfile a separate motion [for abuse of process] but will instead object to any attempt at adducing evidence that would attempt to contradict the decisions of the Federal Court [in the Vilven\/Kelly matter].\u201d This issue shall be addressed at the upcoming Case Management Conference.\nMotion Re: ACPA's Statement of Particulars\n[27] The Coalition Complainants seek an Order striking out section (d) of ACPA\u2019s SOP, i.e., the section entitled, \u201cAre the Provisions of the Collective Agreement Which Mandate Retirement at Age 60 a Bona Fide Occupational Requirement?\u201d\nGrounds of Motion\n[28] The moving parties assert that a section 15(1)(a) BFOR defence to an alleged discriminatory practice is only available if established by an employer. It is not open to a bargaining agent. Therefore ACPA has no entitlement to argue such a defence and any pleading doing such should be struck out. Furthermore, even if such a defence were available to a non-employer, the moving parties submit that the provision of the collective agreement that mandates such a requirement is not an occupational requirement, but only an Air Canada-ACPA one. \u201cTransport Canada, the regulatory body that establishes the relevant occupational requirements for the pilot occupation in Canada has no maximum age limitation whatsoever on pilot licensing.\u201d\nACPA\u2019s Response\n[29] ACPA responds that the moving parties are improperly preventing it from mounting a defence to the instant allegations of discrimination against the union. Re: the issue of a BFOR defence only being available to an employer, ACPA counters that \u201cthat proposition is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and the obligations to accommodate which the Act imposes on employee organizations.\u201d Counsel for ACPA cites the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970. ACPA also submits that this issue was determined recently in its favour by the Tribunal in Thwaites, supra, at paras. 336-40.\n[30] Re: the issue of what constitutes an \u201coccupational requirement\u201d, ACPA states the Complainants\u2019 assertions are \u201cbaseless\u201d and that per the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in BC Public Service Employee Relations Comm. v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d), \u201cthe \u201cstandard\u201d, \u201crule\u201d or \u201coccupational requirement\u201d is one that has been adopted by an employer and not imposed by statute\u2026The \u201crule or standard\u201d which is at issue in the cases before the Tribunal is the one that requires mandatory retirement at age 60. That is clearly identified in the particulars\u2026\u201d ACPA argues that this was also determined recently by two different panels in Vilven\/Kelly, supra and Thwaites, supra, respectively.\nAnalysis\n[31] I agree with ACPA\u2019s submissions. Re: both the issues of whether a BFOR defence is open to a non-employer (in this case, ACPA) and whether there exists an occupational requirement within the meaning of the BFOR defence, the positions of both the moving parties and ACPA are arguable. Hence, they should be left to argument at the hearing after the presentation of evidence. ACPA\u2019s arguable defence should not be struck out at the pleading stage, assuming that the Tribunal even has the statutory authority to do so.\n[32] Furthermore, the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d test has not been established as the moving parties\u2019 assertion that a BFOR defence is only open to an employer was argued before and rejected by the Tribunal in Thwaites, supra, at paras. 336-40. On the other issue, in both recent Decisions in Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites, supra, each of the two respective panels, while disagreeing as to whether a BFOR defence was established, nevertheless concurred that the mandatory retirement at age 60 provision was a work standard and thus an \u201coccupational requirement\u201d. Again, this raises the broader question of the re-litigation of issues already determined by the Tribunal.\nConclusion\n[33] Based on the foregoing reasons, both motions are dismissed.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

Craig\nDate: October 21, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 18\nI. Matters Considered On Jurisdiction [1] On the morning of November 18, 2005, Teiohontathe Fallan Davis (Teiohontathe) was on her way home from the United States. She was alone, driving an old black Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). Teiohontathe stopped at the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) port of entry on Cornwall Island in Cornwall, Ontario, where she was well known to CBSA officers as a resident of the Akwesasne reserve and a frequent traveller who crosses the border several times a day.\n[2] CBSA is a corporate body established by the Canada Border Services Agency Act (CBSA Act). Its mandate is set out in s. 5 of the CBSA Act:\nThe agency is responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities and facilitate the free flow of persons and goods, including animals and plants that meet all requirements under the program legislation, by\n(a) supporting the administration or enforcement, or both, as the case may be, of the program legislation: \u2026\n[3] It is common knowledge that persons coming into Canada pass through a one or two-stage process when clearing customs and immigration. The first stage is a primary examination in which the traveller is asked preliminary questions by a CBSA officer, after which the traveller may be permitted to proceed. However, if the officer determines, from the perspective of customs or immigration requirements, that a more in-depth review is required, he or she refers the traveller to another officer for a secondary examination.\n[4] Teiohontathe experienced a hasty primary examination followed by a lengthy secondary examination, during which she was required to stand outside in very cold weather while her SUV was scanned by a mobile Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) process, and while it was intensively searched by several officers afterward. At the conclusion of this primary\/secondary examination process, Teiohontathe\u2019s SUV was returned to her and she was allowed to proceed into Canada.\n[5] In its statement of particulars, the CBSA stated that Teiohontathe\u2019s SUV was \u201cpulled over for a routine inspection\u201d using the VACIS, and also that her SUV was the type of vehicle that had been targeted for inspection that day by a CBSA intelligence officer because a recent inspection of an SUV had revealed a secret compartment suitable for contraband.\n[6] In a complaint subsequently filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission), Teiohontathe claimed that CBSA officers engaged in racial profiling and infringed her rights under s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) by selecting her for a secondary inspection using VACIS, and that by reason of her race, age and\/or sex, she was subjected to heightened suspicion or aggression and subjected to insulting and demeaning racial comments.\n[7] Member R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) conducted an inquiry into Teiohontathe\u2019s complaint during the periods November 30 to December 4 and December 14 to 18, 2009, but did not complete the inquiry. Member B\u00e9langer suspended the hearing as a result of CBSA\u2019s claim that he was demonstrably partial to the complainant and should recuse himself. A formal motion by CBSA was argued on October 13, 2010, and on March 28, 2011, Member B\u00e9langer delivered a ruling dismissing the motion. He subsequently withdrew as adjudicator and, in due course, the Tribunal Chairperson directed me to continue with the inquiry.\n[8] On August 24, 2011, counsel for CBSA presented written and oral argument in support of its motion for an order dismissing Teiohontathe\u2019s complaint against CBSA on the grounds that CBSA does not provide \u201cservices\u201d under s. 5 of the CHRA when it enforces Canada\u2019s customs and excise legislation, and is therefore not subject to s. 5 of the CHRA and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n[9] Counsel for CBSA framed the issue and CBSA\u2019s position concisely:\nDid the duties and functions carried out by the CBSA officers in putting questions to the complainant upon her entering into Canada and in examining and scanning her vehicle constitute the \u2018provision of \u2026 services\u2019 within the meaning of section 5 of the Act?\nThe CBSA submits that the duties and functions carried out by CBSA officers in enforcing the Customs Act that are complained of in this case do not constitute the \u2018provision of \u2026 services\u2019 within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA, and that the Tribunal is therefore without jurisdiction to conduct a hearing into the complainant\u2019s complaint.\n[10] Teiohontathe attended the hearing of the motion in person, and while she was not represented by counsel, submissions were made on her behalf by Ms. Dana Thompson (Kakwerais) - who summarized the history of the Akwesasne nation and Teiohontathe\u2019s community, Kanion\u2019ke:haka. The Akwesasne nation straddles the Canada\/United States border, placing it within several jurisdictions, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and New York State in the United States, necessitating frequent border crossings by the Akwesasne people. Teiohontathe would cross the border regularly, sometimes as often as 10 times a day, taking her daughter to school, visiting family members, attending to personal matters and conducting her business.\n[11] In its statement of particulars, CBSA acknowledges that \u201cthe Cornwall Island port of entry is located on the Mohawk Reserve of Akwesasne. Approximately 80% of travellers who cross the border at this location are residents of the Akwesasne reserve. At the request of the Mohawk community, one of the traffic lanes located at the Cornwall Island port of entry (Primary Inspection Lane 4, or P4) is reserved for the exclusive use of residents of the Akwesasne reserve and is open during peak traffic times.\u201d\n[12] The Commission was represented by counsel at the hearing of the motion, and took the position that the CBSA\u2019s interaction with Teiohontathe at the Cornwall port of entry on November 18, 2005 constituted \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, and the Tribunal therefore had jurisdiction to hear her complaint. Teiohontathe adopted the Commission\u2019s argument on the jurisdiction issue.\n[13] S. 5 of the CHRA provides:\nIt is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[14] Section 3 of the CHRA sets out the prohibited grounds of discrimination: race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[15] CBSA maintained that \u201cservices\u201d contemplates something of benefit being held out as services and offered to the public, and that enforcement actions such as those undertaken by CBSA officer with Teiohontathe do not constitute services because they are not held out or offered to the public and they are not the result of a process which takes place in the context of a public relationship.\n[16] CBSA cites Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170 as decisive authority in support of its position, and makes specific reference to paragraphs 31, 33 and 34:\n[31] Addressing this question, I agree that because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d requirement in section 5 will usually be present in cases involving discrimination arising from government actions (see for example Rosin, supra at para.11, and Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) (1988), 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253 at 266-268). However, the first step to be performed in applying section 5 is to determine whether the actions complained of are \u201cservices\u201d (see Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para. 60). In this respect, \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of section 5 contemplate something of benefit being \u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered\u201d to the public (Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para 55). Enforcement actions are not \u201cheld out\u201d or \u201coffered\u201d to the public in any sense and are not the result of a process which takes place \u201cin the context of a public relationship\u201d (Idem, per Iacobucci J., para. 16). I therefore conclude that the enforcement actions in issue in this case are not \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of section 5.\n[33] Regard must be had to the particular actions which are said to give rise to the alleged discrimination in order to determine if they are \u201cservices\u201d Gould, supra, per Iacobucci J., para 16 per La Forest J., para 60), and the fact that the actions are undertaken by a public body for the public good cannot transform what is ostensibly not a service into one. Unless they are \u201cservices,\u201d government actions do not come within the ambit of Section 5. As in the present case, the enforcement actions which form the object of the complaint are not \u201cservices\u201d under any of the meanings that can be given to this word, the Commission is without jurisdiction to hear the complaint.\n[34] In reaching this conclusion, I have had in mind throughout that the Act, being dedicated to the advancement and protection of human rights, should be given a broad, liberal and purposive interpretation in order to maximize its reach. However this is not a matter of giving the word services a generous meaning in order to achieve that goal; this is a matter of not giving that word a meaning that it cannot bear (Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para 50 and per Iacobucci J., para.13).\n[17] I conclude that paragraphs 31, 33 and 34 must be considered in context with paragraph 22:\n[22] In my view, Health Canada, when enforcing the Food and Drugs Act in the manner complained of, is not providing \u2018services \u2026 customarily available to the general public\u2019 within the meaning of section 5. The actions in question are coercive measures intended to ensure compliance. The fact that these measures are undertaken in the public interest does not make them \u2018services.\u2019 (emphasis added)\n[18] Counsel for the Commission argued that Watkin is not binding. The following is a summary of his argument:\n\u2022 Watkin leaves open the possibility that enforcement actions in other cases could constitute \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA. Watkin para. 31: \u201cI therefore conclude that the enforcement actions at issue in this case are not \u2018services\u2019 within the meaning of section 5.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\u2022 The Federal Court of Appeal did not cite or refer to the Customs and Excise Human Rights Investigation Regulations (CEHRI Regulations) in its general discussion of enforcement activities, and this critical difference renders the outcome in Watkin of limited application.\n\u2022 The relationship between Teiohontathe and the CBSA is qualitatively different than that of the parties in Watkin. Teiohontathe alleges in this case that she is routinely required to cross the border in order to carry out the normal activities of everyday living, and as such, she has an ongoing \u201cpublic relationship\u201d with the CBSA, having regular face-to-face interactions with its officers, as often as 10 times per day. Relationships of this kind are ones that properly fall within the scope of reviewable \u201cservices\u201d.\n\u2022 In Watkin, the Federal Court of Appeal began its decision with a preliminary comment: \u201c\u2026I note that it is difficult to detect any genuine human rights concern in this complaint brought by the appellant as it appears to be driven by purely commercial motives. \u2026\u201d In contrast, Teiohontathe\u2019s case is exactly the kind of case for which human rights protections were created, and if the CBSA\u2019s motion is granted and Teiohontathe\u2019s complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the result will be that persons who are subjected to racial slurs or other forms of discrimination at border crossings will no longer have human rights recourse, a very serious result that should only be imposed if Parliament amends the CHRA or CBSA Act to provide clear wording that compels such a conclusion.\n[19] I am satisfied that the characterization of Health Canada\u2019s enforcement actions as \u201c\u2026coercive measures intended to ensure compliance\u201d limits Watkin to its facts. While Watkin may be persuasive, it is not determinative of the issue in this case.\n[20] Bearing in mind that the Federal Court of Appeal in Watkin did not define the meaning of \u201cenforcement,\u201d I must consider whether CBSA officers conducting primary and secondary inspections of travellers and their vehicles are providing \u201cservices\u201d within their mandate of \u201cintegrated border services\u201d.\n[21] In doing so, I am mindful that the CBSA is mandated to administer and\/or enforce the \u201cprogram legislation\u201d, principally the Customs Act, which inevitably involves recovering appropriate taxes on goods from law-abiding citizens and businesses. The Customs Act establishes a dynamic relationship between the public and CBSA officers in a comprehensive process. In the initial stage of primary and secondary examination, CBSA officers are to facilitate entry into Canada of law-abiding travellers and any goods they are importing. In carrying out this function CBSA officers have a concomitant duty to deal appropriately with tax\/duty evaders which may include seizure, forfeiture, and monetary penalties.\n[22] However, if this routine process presents circumstances that establish a suspicion, on reasonable grounds, that a traveller is in possession of illicit goods or substances, then the officer must act in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of the Customs Act. Part VI is titled \u201cEnforcement, Powers of Officers\u201d, and it stipulates the process which must be followed in conducting a search of a traveller.\n[23] In the case of travellers found to be engaged in smuggling of prohibited goods and unlawful substances, CBSA officers must abide by the procedures in the Criminal Code of Canada and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[24] Overarching the foregoing is a basic public interest in CBSA activities. Canadians depend on CBSA officers to facilitate entry to Canada of all legitimate travellers while at the same time screening out undesirables. CBSA is perceived to be, and is expected to conduct itself, as an adjunct service to police services. Both services are involved in maintaining peace and order in Canada. There is a significant degree of similarity in their function.\n[25] Counsel for the Commission outlined a statutory regulatory regime which synchronizes CHRA review of CBSA activities with the Recourse Directorate, Admissibility Branch of the CBSA.\n[26] S. 43 (4) of the CHRA provides:\nThe Governor in Council may make regulations\n(a) prescribing procedures to be followed by investigators;\n(b) authorizing the manner in which complaints are to be investigated pursuant to this part; \u2026\n[27] On February 25, 1983, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, enacted the CEHRI Regulations.\n[28] CEHRI Regulations 3 and 9 are pertinent to the issues raised in the CBSA motion:\n3. Where a complaint is received by the Commission arising from the actions of an officer engaged in the administration or enforcement of a law relating to customs and excise, the Commission shall serve on the Deputy Minister a copy of the complaint;\n(a) notice of the name of the investigator designated pursuant to subsection 35(1) of the Act to investigate the complaint;\n(b) an investigation plan that\n(i) identifies those relevant documents believed to be under the control of the Department that the investigator may request to examine, and\n(ii) identifies those officers whom the investigator may request to examine.\n9. At the completion of an investigation of a complaint, the investigator shall inform the appropriate Regional Collector of Customs or Regional Director of Excise, as the case may be, of his findings and the recommendations that he intends to make to the Commission. (emphasis added)\n[29] The Commission argues that the CEHRI Regulations give rise to a necessary implication that CBSA officers are providing a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, and establish a public right to file CHRA complaints relating to the manner in which CBSA officers deal with travellers in administering or enforcing federal customs and excise law.\n[30] In support of its argument the Commission tendered a copy of an affidavit of Lucinda Reading, Senior Program Advisor for the Recourse Directorate, Admissibility Branch, CBSA, dated March 4, 2009. In this affidavit, Ms. Reading describes her duties:\nI am responsible for dealing with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) and coordinating the management of service-related discrimination complaints, including the monitoring of settlements and other matters that may arise with respect to complaints made by members of the public against the CBSA\n[31] In paragraph 4 of her affidavit, Ms. Reading describes the formal relationship between the Commission and the CBSA:\nThe CBSA and the Commission entered into a general Memorandum of Understanding with the Commission (sic) dated December 7, 2005. A copy of this MOU is attached hereto as Exhibit \u201cA.\u201d The CBSA and the Commission entered into a subsequent operational memorandum of understanding (dated March 31, 2006) defining the procedures, roles, responsibilities and timelines intended to guide the review and processing of complaints made against the CBSA to the Commission. A copy of the operational MOU is attached hereto as Exhibit \u201cB.\u201d The CBSA expects that the Commission will conduct its investigations into complaints against the CBSA in accordance with the MOU and the operational MOU.\n[32] The \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the December 7, 2005, MOU states the purpose of collaboration between CBSA and the Commission:\nThe Canada Border Services Agency (the Agency) and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), hereinafter referred to as the \u201cParticipants,\u201d signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on December 7, 2005, in which they agreed to collaborate to prevent discrimination in the workplace and in the provision of services to the general public, as well as to take steps to deal efficiently with any complaints of discrimination that may arise either within the Agency or from the general public. This MOU sets out procedures to guide the Participants in support of these objectives. (emphasis added)\n[33] Commission counsel argued that by enactment of the CHRA, a law prohibiting discrimination with respect to \u201cservices\u201d, and the subsequent creation of the CBSA, an agency whose title describes it as a provider of \u201cservices\u201d, Parliament must have intended that the prohibition on discrimination would apply to the activities of the CBSA.\n[34] I conclude that the CEHRI Regulations and the Memorandums of Understanding establish that this was in fact the intention of Parliament.\n[35] The Commission also argued that the CBSA identifies itself as a service provider in the following publications:\n\u2022 CBSA has published a \u201cCommitment to Service Excellence\u201d, the components of which are \u201crespect and courtesy\u201d, \u201cfair application of the law\u201d, \u201cprivacy and confidentiality\u201d, \u201cbilingual service\u201d, \u201caccurate information\u201d, and \u201creview of our actions and decisions\u201d.\n\u2022 The CBSA website states that, \u201cService excellence is a key priority of the CBSA \u2026\u201d\n\u2022 The CBSA Code of Conduct states that, among other things, \u201cYou are prohibited from engaging in any discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\u201d Sidebar reference is made to section 2 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[36] Finally, the Commission argued that applying CHRA s. 5 to the CBSA would be consistent with provincial human rights decisions involving police services, which the Commission submits are similarly applicable to the conduct of CBSA officers:\nBoth are engaged in the ground level, day-to-day administration and enforcement of legislation that is designed at least in part to support security and public safety priorities. Both have direct face-to-face interactions with the public. Both have powers to question and search members of the public in appropriate circumstances.\n[37] During the course of oral argument on this motion, I expressed skepticism when counsel for the Commission argued the persuasive relevance of decisions of provincial human rights tribunals that police forces provide a service customarily available to the public. However, having carefully considered the cited cases, I conclude that there is general acceptance in the case law across Canada that police officers provide \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of provincial human rights law, and that the similarity in the enforcement functions performed by police officers and CBSA officers ought not be disregarded since, as counsel for the Commission put it, \u201cto do otherwise would fail to heed the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s direction that human rights statutes should be interpreted in a consistent and harmonious fashion, where possible\u201d.\nII. Decision [38] The CBSA was created in 2003 to conduct integrated border services, ranging from facilitating the free flow of persons and goods to dealing with national security and public safety priorities. A core activity of the CBSA is administering and\/or enforcing federal customs and excise law, largely a tax-collecting function. Enforcement is process-driven, such that when there is disagreement with a commercial enterprise or an individual traveller, the CBSA undertakes to engage in an impartial review of the enforcement action and to administer applicable laws in an objective and non-discriminatory manner.\n[39] The CBSA has a direct public relationship with all Canadians returning to Canada. It is a public body providing border services for the public good. It declares, unequivocally, its commitment to \u201cservice excellence\u201d in keeping Canada\u2019s borders secure, and that \u201cservice excellence\u201d is of vital importance in serving the trade community, Canadian citizens and visitors to Canada.\n[40] By necessary implication and inference, the CEHRI Regulations establish that CBSA officers are providing a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA when they are carrying out the administration or enforcement of the CBSA Act. The CEHRI Regulations establish a public right to file CHRA complaints relating to the manner in which CBSA officers deal with travellers in administering or enforcing federal customs and excise law.\n[41] In accordance with the CEHRI Regulations, and enabled by the Memorandums of Understanding dated December 7, 2005, and March 31, 2006, the Commission and the CBSA have created a functional and synchronized process to prevent discrimination \u201cin the provision of services to the general public, as well as to take steps to deal efficiently with any complaints of discrimination that may arise either within the Agency or from the general public\u201d.\n[42] In processing Teiohontathe and her vehicle through primary and secondary examinations, CBSA officers were providing \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA. Teiohontathe\u2019s claim that she was singled out and discriminated against by reason of gender and race must be dealt with by a Tribunal inquiry.\nIII. Orders [43] The motion of the Canada Border Services Agency seeking dismissal of Teiohontathe\u2019s complaint is dismissed.\n[44] The Tribunal inquiry into Teiohontathe\u2019s complaint shall continue.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Garfield\nDate: October 24, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 19\nIntroduction\n[1] On September 30, 2011, I granted the motion of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (\u201cPIPSC\u201d) to become an Interested Party in the instant proceeding, with conditions. It may cross-examine witnesses and make submissions, but may only adduce evidence with leave of the Tribunal. These are my Reasons for making that Ruling.\nMain Proceeding\n[2] The proceeding involves the finding of a different panel of the Tribunal that:\n\u2026the Complainants [now numbering 417] have established that the Respondents' refusal since March of 1978, to recognize the professional nature of the work performed by the medical adjudicators [almost exclusively female nurses] in a manner proportionate to the professional recognition accorded to the work of the medical advisors [predominantly male doctors], is a discriminatory practice within the meaning of both ss. 7 and 10. The effects of the practice have been to deprive the adjudicators of professional recognition and remuneration commensurate with their qualifications, and to deprive them of payment of their licensing fees, as well as training and career advancement opportunities on the same basis as the advisors.\n[Walden v. Canada (Social Development), 2007 CHRT 56, at para. 143]\nThe Medical Adjudicators and Medical Advisors adjudicate claims under the Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits Program.\n[3] Both the Tribunal\u2019s Liability and Remedy Decisions were judicially reviewed, unsuccessfully in the case of the former and successfully in the latter. The Remedy matter was referred back on two issues to be resolved: one involving compensation for pain and suffering; and the other, involving compensation for wage (including benefit) loss. The parties have negotiated a settlement on the pain and suffering component and have asked the Tribunal for a Consent Order disposing of this issue. The wage loss issue remains outstanding.\nMotion for Interested Party Status\n[4] PIPSC brought a motion to be added as an Interested Party, with full status: i.e., right to adduce evidence, cross-examine witnesses and make submissions (oral and written). The Armstrong- and Harrison-represented Complainants and the Commission consent to PIPSC being added as an Interested Party. The Self-represented Complainants take no position. The Respondent opposes the motion.\nGrounds of the Motion\n[5] PIPSC argues that section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d) gives the Tribunal wide discretion in making this determination. It states that interested party status (sometimes referred to as \u201cintervenor\u201d status) has been granted in the past by the Tribunal in situations where:\n(a) the prospective interested party\u2019s expertise will be of assistance to the Tribunal;\n(b) its involvement will add to the legal positions of the parties; and\n(c) the proceeding may have an impact on the moving party\u2019s interests.\nPIPSC submits that meeting any one of these criteria is sufficient to be accorded the status.\n[6] The moving party argues that it has met all three criteria or conditions. Regarding the first criterion, PIPSC has a 91-year history as an association, then union, representing federal public servants. Today, it has approximately 57,000 members employed by approximately 27 different employers in seven jurisdictions. Eighteen of the bargaining units with over 40,000 members are in the federal government sphere. These members in the federal public service \u201care a highly skilled and well-educated workforce, comprised largely of scientists and other professionals.\u201d Notably, PIPSC is the bargaining agent for the Medical Adjudicators (nurses) (as of July 20, 2011), the Medical Advisors (doctors), and indeed, all of the sub-groups in the Health Services Occupational Group (SH). This Group includes other Medical\/Disability Adjudicators in the federal public service.\n[7] PIPSC submits that its expertise will be of assistance to the Tribunal in determining the quantum of wage loss and the method for arriving at that determination. \u201cAs a sophisticated and experienced federal public service bargaining agent, the Institute has professional staff with expertise in the areas of classification, collective agreement bargaining, and federal public service wage rates. This is expertise and knowledge that the complainants do not possess.\u201d PIPSC also points out that it has a human rights expertise, and \u201ca proven track record\u201d in advancing human rights claims before this Tribunal and the courts.\n[8] The bargaining agent also states that its involvement will add to the legal positions of the parties. It cites a number of examples. PIPSC claims that its participation will not duplicate those of the parties, although it acknowledges that many of the positions of it, the Complainants and the Commission will be similar.\n[9] On the third criterion, it claims that that its interests as the bargaining agent and those of its members are clearly engaged in this proceeding. It is the bargaining agent now for the Medical Adjudicators, which includes most of the Complainants (some are retired), and those Medical Adjudicators who are not Complainants in this proceeding, but may be entitled nevertheless to compensation as \u201cvictims\u201d pursuant to the CHRA.\n[10] PIPSC notes that the SH Group collective agreement expired last month. The determination of the Tribunal on the wage loss issue will be relevant to the bargaining of a new agreement, although the two processes are distinct. PIPSC acknowledges that the Tribunal is to determine the appropriate quantum of past wage loss based on the CHRA, case law and evidence before it. \u201cRegardless, even a lump sum payment for past wage loss could impact the wage rate provisions in the Medical Adjudicators\u2019 next Collective Agreement, and therefore its terms are potentially affected by any Tribunal decision.\u201d\n[11] PIPSC also submits that the Respondent\u2019s position regarding bargaining has been inconsistent and unclear \u201cwith respect to the role of collective bargaining and a negotiated wage rate on the Tribunal\u2019s determination of wage losses.\u201d As a result, it \u201cremains concerned that its interests and that of its members will be affected by any Tribunal order.\u201d\n[12] The bargaining agent further claims that its interests and those of its members are in play here especially given the fact that the discriminatory practice continues to this day \u2013 i.e., the Medical Adjudicators are still being paid at the Program Administrator classification rate. This is notwithstanding the Tribunal having ordered on May 25, 2009 that they be reclassified as a new nursing sub-group (NU-EMU) and that \u201cwork on the creation of the new NU subgroup commence within 60 days of the date of this decision\u201d: see Walden v. Canada (Social Development), 2009 CHRT 16, at para. 60. This has resulted in \u201ca pyrrhic victory\u201d for the Complainants, according to PIPSC.\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[13] The Respondent states that, to obtain interested party status, an applicant must meet the following two-prong test:\n(a) the applicant must demonstrate that its expertise will be of assistance in determining the issues before the Tribunal; and\n(b) the applicant must demonstrate that it will add significantly to the legal position of the parties representing a similar viewpoint.\nThe Respondent says PIPSC meets neither.\n[14] Now that the pain and suffering component appears to be settled (depending on whether all of the Self-represented Complainants have agreed to the settlement), the outstanding issue before the Tribunal is a discrete one: the quantum of wage loss (including benefits). The Respondent submits that PIPSC\u2019s claimed areas of expertise (i.e., in the areas of classification, collective bargaining, federal public service wage rates, and human rights) will not be of assistance to the Tribunal.\n[15] Regarding its expertise in classification, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal has already made a determination and ordered the creation of a new nursing sub-group. This aspect of the Order was not judicially reviewed. \u201cIn fact, the complainants argued before the Tribunal that the appropriate redress would be to include them in the Nursing Classification [as a new sub-group: NU-EMU].\u201d PIPSC should not be allowed \u201cto launch a collateral attack on the earlier re-classification order\u2026\u201d Thus, its expertise in this area will not be of assistance to the Tribunal.\n[16] The Respondent states that PIPSC\u2019s expertise in collective bargaining is also of no assistance here. The Tribunal cannot order compensation for any period beyond the date at which the discriminatory practice ceases, according to the CHRA. As well, it can only order a lump sum award as a monetary remedy.\n[17] Regarding public service wage rates, the Respondent says these are publicly available and on-line. \u201c\u2026PIPSC offers no greater or additional expertise than what is already available publicly and\/or through Treasury Board Secretariat.\u201d\n[18] With respect to human rights expertise, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal itself as well as the Commission has a statutorily recognized expertise in this area.\n[19] PIPSC also will not add to the legal position of the parties, according to the Respondent. The bargaining agent\u2019s \u201csubmissions indicate its position is virtually identical to that of the represented Complainants and the Commission.\u201d\n[20] The Respondent further submits that the Tribunal\u2019s re-determination of past wage loss will not impact on PIPSC\u2019s interests. Nothing in this proceeding to date will impact on the bargaining agent\u2019s reputation and indeed, it only recently became the bargaining agent for the Complainants who are CPP Medical Adjudicators. As well, there is no collective agreement at present between Treasury Board and PIPSC covering the Medical Adjudicators. The Medical Adjudicators are still being paid at the PM rates. Furthermore, \u201ccollective bargaining is a process separate and apart from the Tribunal\u2019s re-determination of past wage loss.\u201d As well, the Respondent says that, while PIPSC represents the Medical Advisors and other nursing sub-groups, none of these people are parties to this proceeding. Hence, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to make an order affecting these groups.\n[21] By way of conclusion, the Respondent states that the Armstrong-represented Complainants have been well-represented. \u201cLaid bare, PIPSC\u2019s interest is in advocating, along with the complainants, for a past wage loss award that is premised on as high an imputed wage rate as possible so that it can use this imputed past rate as leverage in future collective bargaining.\u201d\nAnalysis\nStatutory Provisions and the Law\n[22] Section 50 of the CHRA gives the Tribunal the authority to add interested parties to the proceeding. The section does not provide any conditions for the exercise of this discretionary power. Rule 8 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure deals with the procedural aspects of such a motion. There has been ample case law at the Tribunal addressing motions for interested party status.\n[23] Concisely put, the case law indicates that interested party status has been granted in the past by the Tribunal in situations where:\n(a) the prospective interested party\u2019s expertise will be of assistance to the Tribunal;\n(b) its involvement will add to the legal positions of the parties; and\n(c) the proceeding will have an impact on the moving party\u2019s interests.\n[24] I am granting the motion, with conditions on the basis that I am satisfied that PIPSC has demonstrated that it meets all three criteria. On the issue of expertise being of assistance to the Tribunal, I am satisfied that PIPSC, as demonstrated in the historical narrative referred to above, has expertise in areas not possessed by the Complainants and Commission that will assist the Tribunal in determining the quantum of wage loss and the method for arriving at that determination. The exercise before the Tribunal is not a simple one. PIPSC will be of assistance as an interested party. As well, while PIPSC\u2019s positions are for the most part identical or similar to those of the Complainants and the Commission, there are instances where it takes a different approach, some more nuanced than others.\n[25] On the third ground, I am satisfied that the proceeding will have an impact on the interests of PIPSC\u2019s members. PIPSC is the bargaining agent for the Complainants and non-complainant Medical Adjudicators who may be deemed as \u201cvictims\u201d under the CHRA and entitled to compensation. On this basis alone, I find that PIPSC has an interest in this phase of the proceeding.\n[26] It is true that PIPSC did not become the bargaining agent until very recently. However, the discriminatory practice has not ceased; it is ongoing. While the Medical Adjudicator position has been reclassified, the Complainants (and \u201cvictims\u201d if so included) are inter alia still being paid at the discriminatory PM rates. The Tribunal\u2019s Order dated May 25, 2009 has yet to be fully implemented.\n[27] I also agree with PIPSC that the Respondent\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis the interplay between this proceeding and collective bargaining has not been consistent. While I acknowledge that the two processes are separate and that the Tribunal has a discrete issue before it (quantum of wage loss\/benefits, assuming that pain and suffering has been agreed to by all of the Complainants), there is interplay. The Tribunal\u2019s determination of wage loss may influence the positions taken by Treasury Board and the bargaining agent in upcoming collective bargaining negotiations. Whether this occurs with regard to the ultimate wage rate negotiated is of course up to the parties to the collective bargaining exercise.\nConclusion\n[28] Based on the foregoing, I ordered on September 30, 2011 that PIPSC be granted interested party status, with conditions. I am satisfied that it can make the necessary contribution and represent its members\u2019 interests by cross-examining witnesses and making submissions \u2013 oral and\/or written. If it becomes evident that it also needs to adduce evidence, then PIPSC may seek leave thereof.\n[29] PIPSC\u2019s granting of interested party status should not be construed as an invitation to re-open matters already determined. For example, on the issue of the NU-EMU sub-group classification, I am reluctant to move in a backward fashion and re-open this issue as PIPSC seems to suggest, even assuming that I have the authority to do so, as this was determined by a previous panel of the Tribunal and was not judicially reviewed by any of the parties. This topic will be addressed at the upcoming Case Management Conference.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

Decision. 24\nVIII..... REMEDY.. 24\nI. Introduction [1] In the period July 19 to 22, 2010, I conducted an inquiry into allegations by the Complainants, James Louie and Joyce Beattie, that officials of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) had engaged in discriminatory conduct in dealing with the Complainants\u2019 applications for a lease under s. 58(3) of the Indian Act (referred to as the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] Section 58(3) of the Act provides:\nThe Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being designated\n[3] Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) provides:\nIt is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facility or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[4] Section 2 of the CHRA provides:\nThe purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\nII. The Facts [5] On the eve of the inquiry, the parties agreed to submit a joint book of 178 documents. During the inquiry, 82 of these documents were received into evidence by agreement or identification by witnesses. I am satisfied that this documentary evidence represents all pertinent dealings and communications between the Complainants and officials of INAC.\n[6] Two witnesses testified: Bruce Beattie, husband of the Complainant Ms. Beattie, who acknowledged authoring or editing virtually all exhibits bearing the Complainants\u2019 signatures, and Sheila Craig, Acting Associate Director, Lands and Economic Development, INAC. Each provided cogent evidence explaining the manner in which Complainants\u2019 applications for a locatee lease was processed and why it was not granted by the Minister of INAC.\n[7] Ms. Craig testified that it is standard practice on receipt of an application under s. 58(3) to send the applicant an information package \u2013 which she characterized as an onerous list of requirements \u2013 before INAC begins to craft an appropriate lease. She testified that these requirements are based on directives contained in INAC\u2019s Land Management Manual, a manual which reflects past experience and legal decisions, enabling INAC officials to speak with one voice to ensure that nothing is overlooked in creating a lease that produces the highest rental income for Indian land owners.\n[8] Mr. Louie is an Indian as defined in the Act. Mr. Louie is a member of the Okanagan Indian Band residing within Okanagan Reserve No. 1 on lands allotted to him by the band council with approval of the Minister of INAC. Mr. Louie\u2019s right of lawful possession is evidenced by certificates of possession issued under s. 20 of the Act.\n[9] On June 27, 2007, Mr. Louie entered into a joint venture agreement with Ms. Beattie, who is also an Indian as defined in the Act. They agreed to form a \u201cbusiness association to respectively prepare and submit an Application for Use of Land within an Indian reserve \u2026 pursuant to s. 58(3) of the Act for a long term and pre-paid residential lease of (certain) lands to the developer (Ms. Beattie).\u201d The proposed lease was to be for a term of 49 years with a nominal rent of $1. The joint venture agreement required that Ms. Beattie was to pay all the costs of building a house on the leased land, and then carry out the subsequent marketing and assigning of the lease, the residual proceeds of which were to be divided between Mr. Louie and Ms Beattie on a 2\/3 and 1\/3 basis respectively. Significantly, the agreement stipulated that Ms. Beattie not market or assign the lease to a third party unless it was at a price and on terms acceptable to Mr. Louie. (Ex. A-1.8)\n[10] By letter dated June 29, 2007, Mr. Louie applied to the BC Region of INAC for a locatee lease under section 58(3) of the Act and submitted:\n(a) an Application for Use of Land Within an Indian Reserve signed by Ms. Beattie;\n(b) his own Application for Lease of Locatee Land; and\n(c) a Band Council resolution dated June 26, 2007, granting permission for a survey of the land, together with a pending survey plan. The stated use of the leased land was construction of one single family residence not greater than 500 m2. Mr. Louie requested completion of his application by September 1, 2007 and closed his letter with a declaration that certain matters were non-negotiable.\n\u201cAs you will note from the attached documents, the total rent payable for the full term of the proposed lease is a nominal pre-paid amount of one dollar. Please be advised that rent to be paid under the proposed lease is not a matter which is open for re-consideration by either the lessee or myself and neither of us has any intention of allowing your officials to interfere in that regard. For that reason, it would be unreasonable and entirely unnecessary that there be any requirement that an appraisal be provided to you by anyone and I will instead provide you with any necessary release of liability in respect to the setting of the rent.\u201d (Ex. A-1.9)\n[11] Virtually all subsequent written and oral communication between the Complainants and INAC officials was conducted on the Complainants behalf by Ms. Beattie\u2019s husband, Bruce Beattie.\n[12] By July 12, 2007, the Complainants\u2019 applications had been assigned to Daryl Adam, an INAC Land Management Officer. On August 14, 2007, Mr. Adam emailed Mr. Beattie stating that he was \u201cwaiting for a response from our legal counsel respecting the release of liability related to the nominal rent\u2026\u201d (Ex. A-1.20)\n[13] On August 17, 2007, Mr. Beattie sent a draft release to Mr. Adam. (Ex. A-1.23)\n[14] On September 19, 2007, Mr. Louie posted an executed release to Mr. Adam which declared his intention to determine his affairs as a self-sufficient and independent entrepreneur:\n\u201cI have elected to independently determine the amount of rent that shall be paid pursuant to the Lease, based on what I consider to be sound business criteria and without regard to any fictional market rent derived from any appraisal or other arbitrary valuation of the Lands which officials acting on behalf of the Minister might favour or recommend to me.\u201d (Ex. A-1.26)\n[15] On September 21, 2007, Mr. Adam emailed a response:\n\u201cIn order for us to proceed with the proposed locatee lease, we will require detailed information with respect to the purposes and the parties involved, seeing as a nominal rent is being requested. \u2026\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve explained before to Mr. Beattie, there are certain steps that need to be taken when issuing locatee leases on reserve, such as: obtaining a BCR from the Band Council, having an appraisal conducted to determine the market value of the land and all relevant information related to the transaction.\u201d (Ex. A-1.30)\n[16] On September 24, 2007, Mr. Adam\u2019s supervisor, Tamara Davidson, the Assistant Manager of INAC\u2019s BC Land and Trust Services, emailed Mr. Louie stating:\n\u201cWithin our policy directive, it states that any deviation from fair market rent should be justified by the proposed lessee, approved in writing by the locatee and recommended for approval by the Lands Officer. The locatee should also be advised to seek independent legal or financial advice before accepting less than fair market rent. In this case, the proposed rent is far less than market rent and there does not appear to be any benefit from the lease going to the locatee. Daryl has asked for more information surrounding this arrangement before a decision can be made on setting the rent. \u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe provide a service to the First Nations in British Columbia and are more than willing to work through the process collaboratively and respectfully.\u201d (Ex. A\u20111.32)\n[17] Mr. Louie replied on September 24, 2007, rejecting Ms. Davidson\u2019s response:\n\u201c\u2026it is obvious you are either unwilling or unable to understand the essential point of the issues raised in my message to you. As indicated previously, I require you to provide, before the end of today, both an apology and confirmation that you and your officials will from now on respect my right to determine my own interests, and without any more of your so called \u201cprotection\u201d, which is entirely self-serving and is a cruel affront to my human dignity.\u201d Ex A-1.34\n[18] On September 25, 2007, Mr. Beattie wrote to Ken McDonald, Acting Director, Lands and Trust Services, BC Region:\n\u201c\u2026 The locatee lease applied for is only a minor element in a private joint venture in which the locatee, the proposed lessee and myself have been involved as business partners over a period of years. The essential terms of the proposed lease (particularly the rent) were determined in the context of the overall business plan and were never intended to be open for renegotiation or change once the lease application was submitted to INAC.\n\u201c\u2026Unfortunately, (we) became aware this past Friday that management in your office no longer intend to honour a principal condition upon which we have been relying, and consequently, the lease may not be completed. Specifically at issue is that the proposed lease was conditioned upon a non-negotiable and nominal pre-paid rent covered by a suitable release of liability from the locatee in favour of the Crown in respect to the setting of the rent.\u201d (Ex. A-1.35)\n[19] On October 1, 2007, Mr. Beattie emailed Assistant Deputy Minister Caroline Davis, informing her that he had yet to receive a response to his letter of September 25, 2007, sent to Mr. McDonald:\n\u201c \u2026 In my view the principal matter in contention is not particularly complicated. The INAC administration either respects, or does not respect, the fundamental entitlement of Indian persons to be presumed to be competent human beings to determine their own economic self- interest in respect to their personal interest in reserve land. A positive and probably the only reasonable answer to that one question ought to be sufficient to resolve all of the matters in issue.\u201d (Ex. A-1.37)\n[20] Mr. McDonald replied on October 11, 2007. After acknowledging that he was aware that the nominal rent related to a joint venture between Mr. Louie and the Beatties, Mr. McDonald rejected the release provided by Mr. Louie and stipulated that certain steps would have to be carried out by the Complainants:\n\u201c-further information on why there would be nominal rent for this proposed project.\n\u201c-an appraisal of the lands must also be taken, as stated in directive 7-3 clause 2.6.2 of the Land Management Manual:\n\u201cAmong the terms which should be negotiated at an early stage are: the proposed rent based on an independent appraisal provided by the proposed lessee and approved by Public Works & Government Services Canada.\n\u201c-we would also require a Certificate of Legal Advice from the locatee to ensure that he agrees with the terms of the lease and understands his rights.\u201d\n[21] Mr. McDonald stated that INAC would continue to work with the Complainants in a respectful manner if all these requirements could be met. Then Mr. McDonald made a gratuitous observation:\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Indian Act does not say that the Minister is to lease lands on the terms and at the direction of the locatee. In this instance, we have not placed any more requirements on the lessee or locatee, we have merely informed both of you on what the requirements are for leasing reserve lands.\u201d (Ex. A-1.45)\n[22] By letter dated October 17, 2007, Mr. Louie sent a one-page document titled Declaration of Benefit, dated the same day and signed in the presence of a lawyer, in which Louie stated that he had obtained independent legal and financial advice concerning the terms of his proposed locatee lease, that he understood its terms and consequences, and \u201cThat I am entirely satisfied that the terms of the Lease, as specified in my aforesaid Application for Lease of Locatee Lands dated June 28, 2007, are for my benefit within the meaning of the word \u201cbenefit\u201d as employed in s. 58(3) of the Indian Act.\u201d (Ex. A-1.46)\n[23] On October 18, 2007, Mr. Beattie continued his debate with Mr. McDonald:\n\u201c\u2026 Clearly, any lease of Mr. Louie\u2019s possessory interest in Lot 170-1, which is all that was ever applied for, has no possible effect whatsoever on the Crown\u2019s underlying title to that land. As we view it, the Department\u2019s role in a s. 58(3) application is confined to a reasonable interpretation of the actual wording of that provision. That provision does not expressly or by necessary implication include most of the administrative steps you apparently consider to be \u201crequirements\u201d. Departmental policy and practice are not the law and place no \u201crequirements\u201d upon Mr. Louie except to the extent they can be shown to be consistent with the intent of the law and are reasonably necessary to achieve the statutory objective.\u201d (Ex. A-1.47)\n[24] By letter dated October 22, 2007, Mr. McDonald stated \u201c\u2026we require certain steps be taken in order to proceed with the proposed nominal rent locatee lease that are not legal requirements as such, but policy requirements stemming from the interpretation of the legislation.\u201d (Ex. A-1.48)\n[25] Over the next several months, Mr. Beattie continued dealing with Mr. Adam and Mr. McDonald. On January 16, 2008, Mr. Beattie emailed Mr. McDonald, complaining about the failure of INAC\u2019s legal advisors to complete a promised draft locatee lease that would accommodate Mr. Louie\u2019s right to determine his own economic self-interest:\n\u201cWe also became aware that preparation of the draft lease, which we have for at least five months been repeatedly assured was nearing completion, apparently by that same legal advisor, has not even been started and will likely not begin until after we have complied with whatever new requirements he\/she might now wish to impose upon us.\u201d (Ex. A-1.67)\n[26] By letter dated January 16, 2008, Mr. McDonald informed Mr. Beattie that a draft lease was being prepared and would be forwarded to Mr. Louie for review. He also informed Mr. Beattie that a Certificate of Independent Financial Advice would still be required that \u201censures Canada has discharged its obligation to exercise ordinary diligence with regard to the transaction.\u201d (Ex. A-1.71)\n[27] On January 31, 2008, Mr. Adam sent a letter to the Chief and Council of the Okanagan Indian Band, informing them of Mr. Louie\u2019s application for a locatee lease of Lot 170-1, Block 4 at Okanagan IR#1 to Ms. Beattie for a term of 49 years for the nominal pre-paid rent of $1:\n\u201cPursuant to INAC policy, Chief and Council have the opportunity to express their views on this land transaction, and whether it conforms to the Okanagan Indian Band\u2019s land use policies, zoning by-laws and development plans.\u201d (Ex. A\u20111.72)\n[28] On February 5, 2008, Mr. Beattie emailed Mr. Adam, objecting to the disclosure to the Band and Council of the nominal amount of rent to be paid under the proposed lease. (Ex. A\u20111.73)\n[29] On February 8, 2008, Mr. McDonald emailed Mr. Beattie and sent copies to Ms. Craig, Mr Adam and several other INAC officials. (Ex. A-1.81)\n\u201cI have reviewed the file this morning. First of all I must apologize for the fact that a record of our telephone conversation, complete with time lines for the proposed leasing activities was not sent to you as was discussed during the call\n\u201cMy recollection of the call, based on Daryl Adams notes is the following:\n\u201cWe had a short discussion about the nature of this transaction, and that this was an emerging issue. Locatees are increasingly looking for ways in which to use their CP lands to lever financing for housing purposes. We also discussed that this is \u201ccutting edge\u201d and as such we will endeavour to work with you to find a lease model that meets Mr. Louie\u2019s needs and will also satisfy INAC\u2019s requirements.\n\u201c\u2026the confrontational nature of your communication with my staff and myself makes it very difficult to work in partnership with you. Your tone and attitude immediately put everyone on the defensive. This is not conducive to the risk management approach I would like to foster.\u201d\n[30] On February 13, 2008, Mr. Beattie emailed Caroline Davis, Assistant Deputy Minister, Indian and Northern Affairs Lands and Trust Services, complaining that some of Mr. McDonald\u2019s officials:\n\u201c\u2026have repeatedly behaved as though their sole function is to obstruct and stifle any economic advancement that locatees might attempt to pursue. That such officials repeatedly resort to entirely arbitrary and racially demeaning demands makes their obstructive activities even more reprehensible.\u201d\n\u201cPlease advise us at your earliest opportunity whether there is any possibility of intervention on your part to have this matter finally and properly resolved. Clearly, if resolution is once again left entirely to the discretion of BC Region, as it was last October, we will have little confidence that any progress will be achieved.\u201d (Ex. A-1.84)\n[31] Ms. Davis responded by letter dated March 5, 2008 informing Mr. Beattie that as part of its administrative due diligence, INAC would ensure that the proposed locatee lease was in compliance with band by-laws, that access and services were available, that no environmental conditions were being created and that proper insurance was in place. Then Ms. Davis explained how s. 58(3) was to be applied:\n\u201cCanada has a special relationship with First Nations and their members so, consequently, these instruments create a trust responsibility once executed. We will, therefore, ensure informed consent before entering into a transaction where there is a risk to the beneficiary, Mr. James Louie. To ensure informed consent, we would insist that Mr. Louie understand what he is giving up when he consents to a 49 year pre-paid lease for $1.00.\u201d (Ex. A-1.97)\n[32] By letter to Mr. Beattie dated March 6, 2008, Ms. Craig repeated the stipulations of Ms. Davis and added a basis for continuing the leasing process:\n\u201cThat being said, I understand that fair-market value may be waived in this case provided that Mr. Louie receives independent financial and legal advice once the lease is completed and the terms have been set. We have a draft Lease for Mr. Louie to consider, and will not finalize the terms without first meeting with him; you are most welcome to attend. (Ex. A-1.100)\n[33] On March 19, 2008, Mr. Louie sent a three-page letter to the Minister of INAC, Hon. Chuck Strahl:\n\u201cI am writing to you as the Minister of Indian Affairs, but also because you are reputed to be a person of considerable integrity and fair mindedness toward Indian people. My hope is that you will bring those qualities to bear on a serious case of dishonourable and abusive treatment which I have experienced in my dealings with certain INAC lands officials acting on your behalf.\n\u201cI am a member of the Okanagan Indian Band and have been employed by the Band administration for more than 25 years. During the past several years I have also pursued some private business ventures involving contract electoral officer services and custom land leases. From that experience, I consider myself fully capable of independently managing my own private business and financial affairs, including taking full personal responsibility for my own decisions in respect to my private interest in reserve land. Over the last decade I have acquired several parcels of undeveloped land on the Okanagan IR # 1 near Vernon, BC under Indian Act certificates of possession (CP). My long term goal is to have those parcels developed for the economic benefit of myself and our Okanagan community.\n\u201cIn order to make better economic use of my CP lands, the Indian Act requires me to apply for s. 58(3) ministerial leases. Those leases are clearly intended to provide economic opportunity and benefits for CP holders, but my experience is that the locatee lease application process, as it is currently administered in the BC Region, has become so grossly inefficient and racially offensive that it is more likely to inhibit than facilitate economic development. It is quite obvious to me that most of the negative aspects of the existing lease application process derive from an archaic and entrenched racist mindset that perceives all Indians to be incompetent to determine their own economic self-interest and who are therefore inherently in need of the degrading paternalism that INAC officials euphemistically call a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. While I recognize that this perception exists among INAC officials and is incorporated in INAC administrative policies and practices, I do not accept that it has any factual or legal justification. I therefore do not accept that it should have any binding effect on me or how I choose to use my own lands.\n\u201cDuring the past year I submitted two separate s. 58(3) applications for very simple residential leases. The form of those applications was deliberately designed to avoid any \u201cspecial relationship\u201d arising between myself and INAC. Both were made conditional upon INAC assuming no responsibility whatsoever for the setting of the principal lease terms, in particular the rent. To achieve that result, each application specifically required INAC to acknowledge and respect my right to independently determine a non-negotiable lease rent that was not intended to reflect market value. In addition to the usual application requirements, each application included a formal release and declaration of benefit to protect the Crown from any possible legal or fiduciary liability in respect to the setting of the lease rent. To further affirm my commitment to insuring that these land transactions would be absolutely risk free for the Crown, I gave my undertaking to provide any additional releases that INAC officials might request from me at any stage of the application process. INAC officials were made fully aware that this was the basis upon which each of my s. 58(3) applications was submitted for their acceptance and processing.\n\u201cBy October of 2007, when the subdivision surveys for the two residential lots had been completed and the first application process had reached the stage when a promised draft lease was to be delivered to me, I was instead informed that some unidentified management official within BC Region had essentially decided that allowing a locatee applicant to set their own lease rent, without INAC\u2019s paternalistic supervision and control, was inconsistent with established policy and conventional practice and would therefore not be permitted. This represented a clear reversal of INAC\u2019s position from what existed when the application was accepted for processing and throughout the four months that INAC\u2019s acceptance was relied upon by both myself and INAC\u2019s own officials.\n\u201cThis late in the process and bad faith reversal of INAC\u2019s position was apparently an attempt to turn an administrative process which was always intended to be absolutely risk free for the Crown, into one where INAC management was now insisting that the Crown be subjected to all the potential liability risks that would be incurred if I had assumed no personal responsibility for setting the lease rent and had provided no releases or declarations to protect the Crown. And all for no reason, other than to justify imposition of additional and offensive procedural requirements which clearly serve no purpose other than to mitigate the potential risks of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d which is created whenever INAC reserves to itself the exclusive authority to set the lease rent on a locatee\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cThe obviously absurd position taken by those particular management officials led to an impasse in the application process which was not resolved until the BC Director of Lands and Trust Services personally intervened. By simply agreeing to respect, as a fundamental human right, my personal freedom to choose not to become involved in any oppressive and legally unnecessary \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the Crown, the Director was able to propose a mutually agreeable course of action, upon satisfaction of which, I was assured that the lease, as it was originally applied for would be completed. Relying upon the Director\u2019s absolutely clear assurance that he had the full authority to commit INAC to completion of the lease in accordance with this agreement, I diligently fulfilled all of my part of that agreement by mid November. Since then, I have been repeatedly assured by lands officials that the drafting of the promised lease was either nearing completion or had been completed, and that I could expect to receive a copy shortly.\n\u201cFour months have now passed and I still have seen nothing of the promised draft lease. It has also become increasingly apparent that management level officials are once again obstructing the application process to prevent the Director from honouring the October commitment he made to complete the lease. My second residential lease application was accepted by the Director and assigned to a lands officer for processing almost two months ago, but has since come to the same fate as the first one. Both applications are now being held up by entirely unjustified obstruction by management level officials who demonstrate no commitment to reason, justice or integrity.\n\u201cI believe that this chain of events clearly demonstrates a level of administrative dysfunction at the BC Regional lands office that can only reflect badly on any commitment you and your ministry have to integrity and honourable treatment of individual Indian land holders. The situation is certainly not conducive to economic development of reserve land, especially where CP land holding is well established and provides the only available opportunity for viable and sustainable economic development.\n\u201cMy hope is that you will see fit to have someone from your staff investigate the serious issues I have tried to describe as accurately as I am able. I expect that any proper investigation will show that there is no dispute that commitments were made on your behalf and they were intended to be relied upon and honoured. There can be no denying that those commitments have not yet been honoured and that there exists no reasonable justification for continued delay. The only important question left to be answered is whether your ministry has sufficient administrative integrity to honour the promises and commitments made under your authority and on your behalf.\n\u201cWhat I have described in this letter is well documented and I would be pleased to provide copies of my records or any other information that an investigator might require. I thank you for giving this matter your serious consideration.\u201d\n\u201cJames Louie\u201d (Ex. A-1.109)\n[34] On May 15, 2008, Hon. Minister Chuck Strahl replied to Mr. Louie:\n\u201cThis is in response to your correspondence of March 19, 2008 regarding your applications for locatee leases on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1.\n\u201cAs a matter of law, there is a special relationship between a Certificate of Possession holder and Canada. The underlying title to reserve lands remains with the federal Crown, while the benefit of those lands and the right to possess them belongs to the Certificate of Possession holder. This is not the usual case for a private landholder. This is a special circumstance, giving rise to a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d A fiduciary relationship is created between the Certificate of Possession holder and Canada when Canada enters into Certificate of Possession leases. This is based on Canada\u2019s unilateral discretion over the Certificate of Possession holder\u2019s Indian interest. Nothing short of legislative reform can extinguish or alter this relationship.\n\u201cConsequently, with Canada as the first party on any instrument granting an interest in reserve land, careful review of the leasing details must be taken into consideration so that the appropriate terms and conditions can be fully set out in the lease.\n\u201cUnder the Indian Act, the authority to establish the rent lies with Canada and cannot be extinguished by any means except legislative change. This authority extends beyond setting of the rent and a release will not alter Canada\u2019s unilateral authority to establish lease terms, which would also include, but is not limited to, environmental provisions.\n\u201cThe leasing process on reserve land is consistent nationally and derived from policy and procedures that are currently in place. Certain requirements must be met before issuing a leasehold interest to any third party on reserve lands.\n\u201cOptions to opt out of the Indian Act for the management of lands are available to First Nation communities through the First Nations Land Management Act, self-government and treaty. The Department encourages First Nation members and councils to work toward long-term regimes that meet their community\u2019s needs.\n\u201cOn March 31, 2008 a draft lease was sent to you for your review. I would ask that you work with the British Columbia regional office so that it may assist you in meeting the requirements for a locatee lease on reserve lands. I will encourage my officials to consult you in the setting of a rent which is economically viable.\u201d\n\u201cChuck Strahl\u201d (Ex. A-1.125)\n[35] The application process continued until the end of 2008, with further unproductive exchanges between the Complainants and INAC. Of note is an internal exchange at INAC between Mr. McDonald and Ms. Craig regarding Mr. Beattie. Ms. Craig had informed Mr. McDonald by email on November 7, 2008, of a lengthy telephone conversation she had with Mr. Beattie, in which she rejected his demand for the immediate granting of a lease under his terms. Paragraph 3 of the email is significant:\n\u201cHe (Mr. Beattie) stated that the leases that he sent us were essentially the same as ours, except that he deleted a number of things that he felt were none of our business. He stated that Mr. Louie wanted one lease to use for himself and the other to pay for his house. He stated that the property was only worth $10K. I asked him what it would be worth in his mind if it were fee simple; he said over $300K. I then told him that was the reason we need to ensure Mr. Louie\u2019s interest was addressed before he leased it for 49 + years and then lost it for default. Mr. Beattie seemed to think that the CP would revert back to Mr. Louie on default; I don\u2019t know who would grant a mortgage under those terms.\u201d\n[36] She advised Mr. McDonald to \u201cSend it all back to him, with a suggested meeting date, and then close the file if we are still at an impasse \u2026\u201d (Ex. A-1.164)\n[37] On November 11, 2008, Mr. McDonald emailed Ms. Craig:\n\u201cSounds good Sheila. By the way at the time I was in contact with him he was told by me to keep a low profile and I would do what I could. You will recall the two releases etc. When he started his letter writing campaign he was told that we had no option but to go by the book.\u201d (Ex. A-1.166) (emphasis added)\n[38] The parties reached a stalemate, with Mr. Louie insisting on his right as an entrepreneurial status Indian and Canadian citizen, owning lands held under Certificates of Possession, to freely develop part of his land holdings under a joint venture agreement with Ms. Beattie, and INAC officials repeatedly and resolutely asserting that they had an unfettered right to determine all aspects of the proposed lease, including periodic rent based upon appraisal of the subject land.\n[39] I am satisfied that the Complainants\u2019 joint venture agreement was either misunderstood by INAC officials or was never given adequate consideration by them. It is a simply crafted three page agreement which states that Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie have formed a business association to submit an application under s. 58(3) \u201c\u2026 for a long term and pre-paid residential lease \u2026 with the intention of eventually marketing and assigning the lease to a third party.\u201d Several stipulations in the joint venture agreement are relevant, and ought to have guided INAC officials in the processing the Complainants\u2019 applications for a locatee lease:\n\u201c2. The duration of the proposed Crown lease shall be for forty-nine (49) years, or such longer period as the parties might mutually agree upon \u2026\n\u201c3. The Lands shall be leased for the purpose of a single family residence including any improvements and uses which are necessary or reasonably ancillary to that purpose.\n\u201c4. The Developer (Beattie) shall pay a one time payment of one dollar ($1.00) in full and final satisfaction of all rent due and payable under the terms of the Crown Lease.\n\u201c5. Subject to paragraph 6 below, the Developer shall pay all costs incurred in preparation of the Application for Use of Land within an Indian Reserve, including any necessary plans, surveys, appraisals, environmental impact assessments and registration of the Crown Lease and all cost of developing marketing and assigning the Crown Lease.\n\u201c6. The Developer shall be entitled to (be) reimbursed for all costs referred to in paragraph 5 above and shall have first priority against the proceeds of any assignment of the Crown Lease, with the residual proceeds divided between the parties on the basis of two third (2\/3) to the Locatee and one third (1\/3) to the Developer.\n\u201c7. The Developer shall not market or assign the Crown Lease to a third party except at a price and on such terms as are acceptable to the Locatee.\u201d\n[40] The first acknowledgment by an INAC official of the joint venture agreement is in an October 11, 2007 letter to Mr. Beattie from Mr. McDonald, responding to Mr. Beattie\u2019s letter of September 25, 2007: \u201cYou have indicated in your letter that there has been a proposal for nominal rent for this particular locatee lease. Further, that the nominal rent related to a joint venture between yourself, the locatee and the lessee.\u201d Mr. McDonald then stated several requirements before INAC would consider the nominal rent including \u201cfurther information on why there would be nominal rent for this proposed project.\u201d I infer that Mr. McDonald had not read the joint venture agreement. If he had, it would have become immediately apparent to him that the nominal rent of $1 was not intended to produce a direct benefit to Mr. Louie. Rather, the proposed $1\/49-year lease was to accomplish two things: first, it constituted Mr. Louie\u2019s contribution to the business venture, and, second, once Ms. Beattie had constructed a single family home on the land and marketed it, the sale would be completed by an assignment of Ms. Beattie\u2019s lessee interest to the purchaser, and Mr. Louie would receive the benefit of 2\/3of the net sale proceeds.\n[41] The concerns expressed by Ms. Craig in her November 7, 2008 email regarding the potential loss of Mr. Louie\u2019s CP interest for default do not make sense in the context of the joint venture.\nIII. Purpose of the CHRA [42] The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held that human rights legislation has a fundamental and quasi-constitutional status, and as such should be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner that advances its broad underlying policy considerations:\nOntario (Human Rights Commission v. Simpson-Sears Ltd (\u201cO\u2019Malley\u201d) [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at 546-47\n(Referring to the preamble in the Ontario Human Rights Code)\n\u201cThere we find enunciated the broad policy of the Code and it is this policy which should have effect. It is not in my view a sound approach to say that according to established rules of construction no broader meaning can be given to the Code than the narrowest interpretation of the words employed. The accepted rules of construction are flexible enough to enable the Court to recognize in the construction of a human rights code the special nature and purpose of the enactment (see Lamer J. in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R.145, app.157-158), and give to it an interpretation which will advance its broad purposes. Legislation of this type is of a special nature, not quite constitutional but certainly more than the ordinary \u2013 and it is for the courts to seek out its purpose and give it effect. The Code aims at the removal of discrimination. This is to state the obvious. Its main approach, however, is not to punish the discriminator, but rather to provide relief for the victims of discrimination. It is the result or the effect of the action complained of which is significant. If it does, in fact, cause discrimination; if its effect is to impose on one person or group of persons obligations, penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed on other members of the community, it is discriminatory.\u201d\n[43] C.N.R. v Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at para. 24 (\u201cAction Travail\u201d)\n\u201c24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\u201d\nIV. Does INAC Provide \u201cServices\u201d Under S. 5 of the CHRA? [44] Extracts from two decisions are pertinent to the question whether all government actions are \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[45] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin [2008] F.C.J. No 710 (C.A.) at page 9, the Court made the following observation:\n\u201cAddressing this question, I agree that because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d requirement in section 5 will usually be present in cases involving discrimination arising from government actions (see for example Rosin, supra at para.11, and Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) (1988, 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253 at 266-268). However, the first step to be performed in applying section 5 is to determine whether the actions complained of are \u201cservices\u201d (see Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para.60).\u201d\n[46] In Canada (Attorney General) v Rosin, 1 F.C. 391 (paragraphs 8 and 11), the Federal Court of Appeal determined that a service does not have to be available to all members of the general public in order to be \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d:\n\u201cIn order for a service or facility to be publicly available, it is not required that all the members of the public have access to it. It is enough for a segment of the public to be able to avail themselves of the service or facility. Requiring that certain qualifications or conditions be met does not rob an activity of its public character. The cases have shown that \u201cpublic\u201d means \u201cthat which is not private,\u201d leaving outside the scope of the legislation very few activities indeed.\n\u201c \u2026 It is difficult to contemplate any government or branch of government contending that a service it offered was a private one, not available or open to the public. Indeed, it may well be said that virtually everything government does is done for the public, is available to the public, and is open to the public.\u201d\n[47] INAC is a government ministry which offers numerous services to Indians who have status under the Act. In her testimony in the matter of s. 58(3) locatee leases, Ms. Craig referred to applicants as \u201cclients\u201d and explained the many ways that INAC intercedes on behalf of locatees in arranging leases with potential lessees.\n[48] That s. 58(3) entails provision of services to a segment of the public is admitted by INAC\u2019s Lands and Trust Services itself, as evidenced by Ms. Davidson\u2019s email sent to Mr. Louie on September 24, 2007:\n\u201cI can assure you that Lands and Trust Services is willing and able to work through the locatee process with you. We provide a service to the First Nations in British Columbia and are more than willing to work through the process collaboratively and respectfully.\u201d\n[49] I conclude that INAC does provide services that are \u201ccustomarily available to the general public,\u201d namely that segment of the public who are status Indians, and that these are beneficial services being \u201cheld out\u201d and \u201coffered\u201d to the public.\nV. Interpretation of S. 58(3) of the Act [50] I am satisfied that the interpretation of s. 58(3) by the Federal Court of Appeal in Boyer v. R. [1986] 2 F.C. 393, applies to the facts of this case:\n\u201c15 \u2026 The right of a Band member in the piece of land which is allotted to him and of which he has lawful possession, although in principle irrevocable, is nevertheless subject to many formal limitations. The member is not entitled to dispose of his right to possession or lease his land to a non member (section 28), nor can he mortgage it, the land being immune from seizure under legal process (section 29), and he may be forced to dispose of his right, if he ceases to be entitled to reside on the reserve (section 25). These are all undoubtedly limitations which make the right of the Indian in lawful possession very different from that of a common law owner in fee simple. But it must nevertheless be carefully noted that all of those limitations have the same goal: to prevent the purpose for which the lands have been set apart i.e. the use of the Band and its members, from being defeated. None of them concerns the use to which the land may be put or the benefit that can be derived from it. The land being in the reserve, its use will, of course, always remain subject to provincial laws of general application and the zoning by-laws enacted by the Band council, as for any land in any municipality where zoning by-laws are in force, but otherwise I do not see how or why the Indian in lawful possession of a land in a reserve could be prevented from developing it as he wishes. There is nothing in the legislation that could be seen as \u201csubjugating\u201d his right to another right of the same type existing simultaneously in the Band council. To me, the \u201callotment\u201d of a piece of land in a reserve shifts the right to use and benefit thereof from being the collective right of the Band to being the individual and personalized right of the locatee. The interest of the Band, in a technical and legal sense, has disappeared or is at least suspended. \u2026.\n\u201c17 \u2026 But in any event, I simply do not think that the Crown, when acting under subsection 58(3), is under any fiduciary obligation to the Band. The Guerin case was concerned with unallotted reserve lands which had been surrendered to the Crown for the purpose of a long term lease or a sale under favourable conditions to the Band, and as I read the judgment it is because of all of these circumstances that a duty, in the nature of a fiduciary duty, could be said to have arisen: indeed, it was the very interest of the Band with which the Minister had been entrusted as a result of the surrender and it was that interest he was dealing with in alienating the lands. When a lease is entered into pursuant to subsection 58(3), the circumstances are different altogether: no alienation is contemplated, the right to be transferred temporarily is the right to use which belongs to the individual Indian in possession ...\n\u201c18 The conclusion to me is clear. Bearing in mind the structure of the Indian Act and the clear wording of subsection 58(3) thereof, there is no basis for thinking that the Minister is required to secure the consent of the Band or the Band council before executing a lease such as the one here in question. It seems that the Act which has been so much criticized for its paternalistic spirit has nevertheless seen fit to give the individual member of a Band, a certain autonomy, a relative independence from the dicta of his Band council, when it comes to the exercise of his entrepreneurship and the development of his land.\u201d\nVI. Complaint of Discrimination - Findings [51] The Complainants\u2019 allege that INAC infringed s. 5 of the CHRA by denying them a service, or differentiating adversely in the provision of a service, on the basis of national or ethnic origin.\n[52] In processing the Complainants\u2019 request for a locatee lease, INAC relied on criteria and procedures in its Land Management Manual in its attempt to determine if Mr. Louie\u2019s proposed transaction was viable and to his benefit. As part of this process, INAC demanded an independent appraisal to determine fair market value, without regard to the entrepreneurial joint venture agreement between the Complainants, and in November 2008, INAC demanded that Mr. Louie establish to INAC\u2019s satisfaction, proof of his \u201cability and competence to enter into the proposed transaction.\u201d (Ex. A-1.167)\n[53] INAC attempted to impose unilateral authority over every aspect of the Complainants\u2019 proposal for a locatee lease. Throughout the processing of Mr. Louie\u2019s application, INAC\u2019s officials took the position that it was their \u201cduty\u201d to intervene to protect Mr. Louie\u2019s interests as a status Indian, and dictate the nature and terms of the sought-after locatee lease. In doing so, they demonstrated how the Act has become an anachronism that is out of harmony with the guaranteed individual liberty, freedom, and human rights enjoyed by all Canadians.\n[54] INAC\u2019s paternalistic conduct toward Mr. Louie was unequivocally endorsed and supported by then Hon. Minister Chuck Strahl in his letter to Mr. Louie on May 18, 2008. The Minister bluntly pronounced that Mr. Louie could not dictate the terms of his sought-after locatee lease, and claimed that \u201ca fiduciary relationship is created \u2026 when Canada enters into Certificate of Possession leases. \u2026Under the Indian Act, the authority to establish the rent lies with Canada and cannot be extinguished by any means except legislative change. This authority extends beyond the setting of the rent and a release will not alter Canada\u2019s unilateral authority to establish the lease terms, which would also include but is not limited to environmental provisions.\u201d (emphasis added)\n[55] The Hon. Minister was mistaken. There is no fiduciary obligation involved in the exercise of ministerial discretion under s. 58(3). Moreover, a unilateral exercise of discretion would be injudicious and negate the purpose of s. 58(3), which is intended to facilitate the leasing of land by individual Indian land owners who envision a benefit for themselves (See Boyer, supra).\n[56] The Complainants\u2019 application for a ministerial lease was based upon a joint venture agreement under which Ms. Beattie would construct a single family home on the leased land and then sell it at a price and on terms acceptable to Mr. Louie and divide the net sale proceeds. The stipulated rent of $1 was not based on the actual value of the land, and was not the benefit that Mr. Louie sought to achieve through the joint venture. The benefit that both Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie sought to achieve was by way of the development of a single family home on the leased property, and its eventual sale. Rather than focussing on the application for a lease in the broader context of the joint venture agreement, and the benefit therein to Mr. Louie, INAC officials insisted that they would draw up a lease in compliance with all applicable Land Management Manual requirements, including a beneficial rental return over a 49-year period based on an appraisal of the land in its prospective improved state.\n[57] INAC\u2019s refusal to accept that Mr. Louie had the right to determine the benefit that might accrue to him from the commercial enterprise that he and Ms. Beattie had undertaken brought the application process to a standstill. For all practical purposes the Complainants\u2019 application for a ministerial lease on the terms that they had agreed upon was rejected by the Minister in his May 15, 2008 letter to Mr. Louie. The Minister\u2019s letter exacerbated INAC\u2019s discriminatory treatment of the Complainants.\n[58] While it was not raised in evidence before me it is noteworthy that on June 18, 2008, little more than a month after writing to Mr. Louie, the then Hon. Minister announced that legislation extending human rights protections to all First Nations communities had received Royal Assent. \u201cPassage of Bill C-21, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act marks a significant turning point in the relationship between First nations and the Government of Canada,\u201d said Minster Strahl. \u201cIt underscores this government\u2019s strong commitment to protecting the human rights of all Canadians.\u201d The announcement, however, had no apparent effect on INAC\u2019s position regarding the complainants\u2019 applications. Nothing changed, and the complaint before me is the result.\n[59] Since the Act is now subject to the CHRA, I conclude that the application process under s. 58(3) must become an enabling administrative function that recognizes and accepts status Indians (other than those who are minors or mentally incompetent) as personally responsible Canadians capable of making their own determinations of anticipated benefits to be derived from leasing their lands, and that ministerial discretion must not be exercised unilaterally.\nVII. Decision [60] The Complainants have substantiated their allegation of being subjected to a discriminatory practice, a denial of services, as described in s. 5 of the CHRA. They have established, prima facie, that they, as status Indians, have been denied by INAC officials, up to and including then Hon. Minister Strahl, the services properly available to them under s. 58(3) of the Act.\n[61] The Complainants are entitled to relief in the absence of justification on the part of the INAC.\n[62] Sections 15(1)(g) and (2) of the CHRA provide that it is not discriminatory practice if there is a bona fide justification for the denial of services. To have bona fide justification, INAC must establish that an accommodation of the Complainants\u2019 needs would impose undue hardship on INAC in accommodating those needs.\n[63] INAC has failed to make out a bona fide justification under ss. 15(1)(g) and (2).\nVIII. REMEDY [64] Pursuant to section 53(2) (a) of the CHRA, the Respondent is to comply with the following orders:\n(1) The Respondent shall reconsider the applications of the Complainants for a locatee lease in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and order;\n(2) The Respondent shall cease its discriminatory practices and take measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to redress the practices or to prevent the same or similar practices from occurring;\n(3) The Respondent shall amend its Land Management Manual and other policies to provide that where individual locatees (other than those determined to be mentally incompetent or under the age of majority) have determined for themselves that a transaction is for their individual benefit, INAC will accept that determination and conduct the processing of requested lease on that basis;\n(4) The Respondent shall comply with the foregoing orders within six months of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in these proceedings;\n(5) The Tribunal shall retain jurisdiction and remain seized of the matter for nine months from the date of its decision in this proceeding, in order to receive further evidence, hear additional arguments and\/or make additional orders in the event that the parties disagree regarding the interpretation or implementation of the relief ordered.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Analysis. 21\nV........... Order 27\nI. The Complaint [1] This is a decision respecting a complaint by Lincoln Dinning that was filed on September 17, 2007. Mr. Dinning\u2019s son, Corporal Matthew Dinning was tragically killed in Afghanistan in April of 2006 in his 23rd year, while on duty as a soldier with the Canadian Forces (\u201cCF\u201d) in the service of his country. Upon the sudden service related death of a CF member, a lump sum death benefit of $250,000.00 (with yearly adjustments for inflation), may be payable by the Minister of Veterans Affairs under s. 57 (1) of the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act (the \u201cNew Veterans Charter\u201d) on an application being made, to the CF member\u2019s \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d as \u201csurvivors\u201d or to a \u201cdependent child\u201d, as defined in the New Veterans Charter. No other persons, including family members, are entitled to the payment of the death benefit if there is no spouse, common-law partner or dependent children at the time of death of the CF member. The following provisions of the New Veterans Charter are relevant:\nInterpretation\n2. (1) The following definitions apply in this Act.\n\u201cCanadian Forces\u201d means the armed forces referred to in section 14 of the National Defence Act, and includes any predecessor naval, army or air forces of Canada or Newfoundland.\n\u201ccommon-law partner\u201d, in relation to a member or a veteran, means a person who is cohabiting with the member or veteran in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least one year.\n\u201cdependent child\u201d, in relation to a member or a veteran, means their child, or a child of their spouse or common-law partner who is ordinarily residing in the member\u2019s or veteran\u2019s household, who is\n(a) under the age of 18 years\n(b) under the age of 25 years and following a course of instruction approved by the Minister; or\n(c) over the age of 18 years and prevented by physical or mental incapacity from earning a livelihood, if the incapacity occurred\n(i) before the child attained the age of 18 years, or\n(ii) after the age of 18 years and before the age of 25 years while the child was following a course of instruction approved by the Minister.\n\u201cmember\u201d means an officer or a non-commissioned member of the Canadian Forces, as those terms are defined in subsection 2 (1) of the National Defence Act.\n\u201csurvivor\u201d, in relation to a deceased member or a deceased veteran, means\n(a) their spouse who was, at the time of the member\u2019s or veteran\u2019s death, residing with the member or veteran; or\n(b) the person who was, at the time of the member\u2019s or veteran\u2019s death, the member\u2019s or veteran\u2019s common-law partner.\n(2) For the purposes of this Act, a spouse is deemed to be residing with a member or a veteran, and a person does not cease to be a member\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s common-law partner, if it is established that they are living apart by reason only of\n(a) one or both of them having to reside in a health care facility;\n(b) circumstances of a temporary nature; or\n(c) other circumstances not within the control of the member or veteran or the spouse or common-law partner.\n(3) A reference in this Act to a member\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s spouse is a reference to a member\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s spouse who is residing with the member or veteran.\n(4) This Act does not apply to a member\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s surviving spouse if the member or veteran dies within one year after the date of the marriage, unless\n(a) in the opinion of the Minister, the member or veteran was at the time of that marriage in such a condition of health as to justify their having an expectation of life of at least one year; or\n(b) at the time of the member\u2019s or veteran\u2019s death, the spouse was cohabiting with the member or veteran in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least one year.\nDeath Benefit\nEligibility \u2014 service-related injury or disease\n57. (1) The Minister may, on application, pay, in accordance with section 59, a death benefit to a member\u2019s survivor or a person who was, at the time of the member\u2019s death, a dependent child if\n(a) the member dies as a result of a service-related injury or disease; and\n(b) the member\u2019s death occurs within 30 days after the day on which the injury occurred or the disease was contracted.\n58. (1) The amount of the death benefit payable in respect of a member shall be the amount set out in column 2 of item 3 of Schedule 2.\n59. If a death benefit is payable to a survivor or a person who was, at the time of a member\u2019s death, a dependent child, the following rules apply:\n(a) if there is a survivor but no person who was a dependent child, the survivor is entitled to 100% of the death benefit;\n(b) if there is a survivor and one or more persons who were dependent children,\n(i) the survivor is entitled to 50% of the death benefit, and\n(ii) the persons who were dependent children are entitled, as a class, to 50% of the death benefit, divided equally among them; and\n(c) if there are one or more persons who were dependent children but no survivor, each of those children is entitled to the amount obtained by dividing the death by the number of those dependent children.\n[2] When the Complainant filed his Complaint, the opportunity to collect the death benefit payment was not available to the Complainant as a parent, or to his remaining son Brendon Dinning, as the brother of Corporal Dinning, as they did not fit within the definitions of the persons eligible to receive the death benefit under the New Veterans Charter as referred to above. As no determination had been made that Corporal Dinning had a common-law partner or dependent child at the time of his death, no family members of Corporal Dinning stood to receive the death benefit. If Corporal Dinning had died leaving a spouse, common-law partner or dependent child, those persons could have qualified for payment of the death benefit.\n[3] The Complainant alleged that by not providing him, as a parent of a single fallen soldier, with the opportunity under the New Veteran\u2019s Charter to collect the death benefit, the Respondent was treating his family (none of whom could collect the death benefit) adversely different than the family of a married fallen soldier, (some of whom could collect the death benefit) thereby engaging in discriminatory practices, based upon the prohibited grounds of family status and marital status under s. 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act ( the \u201cCHRA\u201d), contrary to both s. 5 and s. 10 of the CHRA. The following provisions of the CHRA (with emphasis I have added) are relevant:\nProscribed Discrimination\nGeneral\nProhibited grounds of discrimination\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\nOrders regarding discriminatory practices\n4. A discriminatory practice, as described in sections 5 to 14.1, may be the subject of a complaint under Part III and anyone found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice may be made subject to an order as provided in sections 53 and 54.\nDiscriminatory Practices\nDenial of good, service, facility or accommodation\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nDiscriminatory policy or practice\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nRetaliation\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nExceptions\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(g) in the circumstances described in section 5 or 6, an individual is denied any goods, services, facilities or accommodation or access thereto or occupancy of any commercial premises or residential accommodation or is a victim of any adverse differentiation and there is bona fide justification for that denial or differentiation.\nDiscriminatory Practices And General Provisions\nComplaints\n40. (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (7), any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint in a form acceptable to the Commission.\nConsent of victim\n(2) If a complaint is made by someone other than the individual who is alleged to be the victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates, the Commission may refuse to deal with the complaint unless the alleged victim consents thereto.\nInvestigation commenced by commission\n(3) Where the Commission has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice, the Commission may initiate a complaint.\nCommission to deal with complaint\n41. (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint if appears to the Commission that\n(a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available.\nComplaint dismissed\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate.\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16 (1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nSpecial Compensation\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[4] The Complaint included the following statements by the Complainant:\nI am filing this Human Rights complaint to your Commission with regards to the Federal Government, in particular Veterans Affairs. I believe they discriminate against the families of SINGLE fallen Soldiers.\nIn short, when a married Soldier is killed in Afghanistan, their families, (spouse & children) receive a lump sum death benefit of $250,000.00. Yet when a SINGLE Soldier is killed, Veterans Affairs doesn\u2019t pay any death benefit to their families, (parents and\/or siblings).\nIn closing, I ask that you please investigate this matter and determine if Veterans Affairs is discriminatory in this particular practice and if so urge them to rectify this situation and treat ALL fallen Soldiers, (when married or single) equally.\nI have reasonable grounds for believing that I have been discriminated against.\nII. Facts [5] No particular individual, other than the Complainant, was identified in the Complaint as a victim of discrimination.\n[6] No consent to the making of the Complaint was obtained by the Commission from any other individual alleged to be a victim of the discrimination in this matter.\n[7] No authorization to the making of the Complaint or to taking any steps in this matter in support of the Complaint was obtained by either the Commission or the Complainant from any other individual alleged to be a victim of the discrimination.\n[8] The Commission did not initiate a complaint in this matter.\n[9] The Complaint, as described in paragraph 4 above, was never amended and was referred to the Tribunal by the Commission on March 8, 2010 pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the CHRA to institute an inquiry.\n[10] Statements of Particulars were filed by the Complainant on July 13, 2010, by the Commission on July 30, 2010 and by the Respondent on September 20, 2010. In the Complainant\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s Statement of Particulars the material facts on which they relied were limited to the personal circumstances of the Complainant not anyone else.\n[11] The hearing took place in London, Ontario for 9 days during the end of March and the beginning of April of 2011. During this time, the Tribunal received 14 binders of exhibits containing 328 documents as well as a handful of loose exhibits. Ten witnesses were called by the Respondent to give evidence including two expert witnesses. The vast majority of exhibits and evidence were obtained for production and produced by the Respondent.\n[12] The Complainant represented himself at the hearing and gave evidence himself. He was the sole witness for the Complainant and he did not call any other witnesses to give any evidence or produce any statements from any family members of any deceased CF member. Mr. Dinning\u2019s wife Laurie and their son Brendon attended parts of the hearing but did not give evidence.\n[13] The Commission appeared at the hearing but did not call any witnesses to give evidence and did not produce any statements from any family members of any deceased CF member.\n[14] The only family members of deceased CF members who appeared or gave evidence at the hearing, other than the Complainant, were three witnesses called by the Respondent in support of its case.\n[15] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was extremely emotional to everyone who heard it as much of it was directed towards the all too short life and tragic death of a beloved son. The incredible joy of watching and participating in the growth from boy to man of a wonderful gifted son was courageously and sorrowfully contrasted by Mr. Dinning with the unspeakable grief experienced by him and his wife after Matthew\u2019s death. Not surprisingly, he described the birth of Matthew as the best day of his life and his death as the worst. His evidence brought home, in chilling and graphic detail, how fleeting, precarious and precious life is; how special the relationship between a parent and child can be; and how devastating the death of a child is. No one who heard Lincoln Dinning\u2019s testimony about his son Matthew and the impact of his death was unmoved by it or unimpressed by him in the dignified way he presented it. I was grateful to have met Mr. Dinning and hope he, his wife Laurie and son Brendon find ways to cope with their loss. I have exactly the same feelings about the testimony of the son and two spouses of fallen soldiers who gave evidence at the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. They spoke of the terrible grief they suffered and the great difficulties they encountered in readjusting to civilian life as a result of the death of a father and spouses.\n[16] In his evidence at the hearing, the Complainant spoke about the impact on him, his wife Laurie and his son Brendon as a result of Matthew\u2019s death. This evidence was given within the context of one of the central issues of the case involving the legislative purpose behind the provision of the death benefit in the New Veterans Charter. This particular benefit is part of a new \u201csuite\u201d of benefits introduced with the coming into force of the New Veterans Charter on April 6, 2006, to improve conditions for CF members and their families. It was common ground among the parties at the hearing that, while the term is not defined, the death benefit is a lump sum payment to recognize and compensate a survivor and dependent child of a CF member for the non-economic impacts of the member\u2019s sudden service related loss of life, such as the resulting loss of guidance, care and companionship and the impact of the member\u2019s death on the functioning of the household. The evidence that the Complainant gave in this regard was as follows:\nThe whole fabric of the family is destroyed after the death of a child.\nWe\u2019re supposed to have Mum, Dad and children, and when your child dies, your idea of family dies.\nOur family pictures always had four people in them, now they only have three.\nLoss of future hopes and dreams. Not being able to see Matthew grow up, get married, have children, be a dad, granddad. I know he would have been a great one.\nChristmas, birthdays, anniversaries, parties are not the same since Matthew isn\u2019t here to share them.\nMatthew\u2019s friends are getting married and having children and we won\u2019t have that now.\nMemory lapses, sleepless nights, feeling guilty.\nAs parents, it\u2019s your job to protect your children. Whether they are 3 or 23, you want to protect them, and in Matthew\u2019s case, we didn\u2019t.\nWe laugh less. We cry more.\nLoss of a son, grandson, brother, friend.\nHis only brother Brendon won\u2019t have Matthew as a best man at his wedding, if he gets married.\nEvery repatriation ceremony brings back a flood of memories and our hearts go out to the newly-bereaved families.\nHearing a song, seeing a movie, looking at a picture, watching a kids\u2019 hockey game or rugby game brings back memories of how things used to be.\nFighting with the government has only added stress to our everyday lives. It makes us feel like second-class citizens. All the talk the government does about supporting the troops and their families doesn\u2019t seem to cut it when it\u2019s a single soldier that is killed.\nStudies have shown that parents who have had children die live shorter lives.\nFamily and friend relationships are different and some are non-existent. People who were friends don\u2019t know what to say, so they choose to stay away. This is apparently quite common after the death of a child.\nGrief counselling is still ongoing. Laurie still goes five years after Matthew\u2019s death and travels two hours each way for her appointments.\nAlways wondering, \u201cWhat could have been?\u201d\nWe miss his laugh, his smile, his voice. No phone calls, no emails, no stories of his adventures, no teasing his brother. No beer on the back porch and hearing all the plans he had for his life.\nHaving a child die is the worst kind of loss a person can experience. When you get married, you say, \u201cTil Death do us part\u201d. You know and expect that one day your spouse will die. But you don\u2019t expect to have your child die. Parents shouldn\u2019t have to bury their children.\nWhen your parent dies, you lose your past.\nWhen your spouse dies, you lose your present.\nIf you child dies, you lose your future.\nYour Honour, I wouldn\u2019t wish this experience on my worst enemy.\nSo when Veterans Affairs think that parents and siblings don\u2019t need to be recognized for the loss of guidance, care and companionship, and that our household will function just fine without Matthew, I beg to differ.\n[17] The Complainant testified that he and his wife were not financially dependent on Matthew at the time of his death. However, they did depend on Matthew in other ways. As the Complainant wrote in his December 27, 2009, submissions in response to the Commission\u2019s investigation report:\nI could depend on Matthew to do anything I asked of him. I would depend on him to cut the grass, blow the driveway when he was home. I could depend on him to put a smile on my face when he told me stories of his career and his many accomplishments. I could depend on him to listen to me as a fellow policeman, when I had a particularly hard day at work and needed someone to talk to. In the future I was depending on Matthew to provide me with grandchildren and to look after me in my old age. So you see, dependence comes in many, many ways. I look no further than my widowed 82-year old mother who lives in the back half of my brother\u2019s house where they provide each other with guidance, care and companionship.\n[18] The Complainant and the Commission did not provide any evidence at the hearing with respect to the impact of the death of any other CF member on their families. As noted, neither Laurie nor Brendon Dinning gave evidence at the hearing and neither of them was mentioned as a victim of discrimination on the Complaint form filed. The Complainant indicated at the hearing that he wanted Brendon included in his Complaint because of his concern that if he succeeded with his Complaint but was unable to collect the death benefit as a result of his own death, he would want it to be paid to his surviving son Brendon so that someone in the Dinning family collected the death benefit as a result of Matthew\u2019s death. The Commission did not support the inclusion of a sibling in the Complaint.\n[19] The Complainant did not provide any evidence or submissions with respect to s. 10 of the CHRA and the Commission did not support the Complaint in respect of s. 10.\n[20] Throughout this matter (including after the hearing as will be described later) the Complainant consistently maintained the position that his concern related to the different treatment, as he saw it, accorded to his son, Corporal Dinning, as a single fallen soldier, whose family could not collect the death benefit, and a married fallen soldier, certain members of whose family could collect the death benefit under s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter. In this regard, he referred in his evidence to examples as follows:\nTwo soldiers are driving along in a Jeep and it gets blown up by a roadside bomb and both are killed. The driver who is married gets the death benefit. The passenger who is single does not. How is that equal?\nWhen our fallen soldiers came home to CFB Trenton, the funeral cortege proceeds north to the 401. The married soldiers don\u2019t turn right and the single soldier turn left.\nThey all go down the Highway of Heroes to be welcomed home equally.\nHe felt that this difference in treatment was inequitable and disrespectful and suggested to him that the Respondent treated the life of his late son as being worth less than the life of a married fallen soldier.\n[21] The Complainant testified that money was not the point of his complaint but rather it was based on principle. He stated that he will never be able to replace his son but he feels that it is fundamental that the Government treat equitably all soldiers who die as a result of a service related injury, whether married or single and that it be governed in this regard by generosity not regulatory logic, no matter how coherent or justifiable. So focused was the Complainant on this theme that the only question he asked virtually every one of the 10 witnesses called by the Respondent was whether they agreed that the Government ought to treat single fallen soldiers and married fallen soldiers equally.\n[22] Further, the Complainant testified that he did not file his complaint to deprive any spouse, common-law partner or dependent child of a married fallen soldier of the death benefit presently available under the New Veterans Charter or to reduce the payment to such persons in any way. He also stated during the hearing and since that if there had been such survivors or dependent children of Corporal Dinning he would not have brought a Complaint or been at the hearing. He did not share the Commission\u2019s contention that the relevant legislation was discriminatory in failing to include parents of married fallen soldiers as possible beneficiaries of the death benefit. In this regard the following exchange took place with me during his testimony the hearing:\nThe Chairperson: Mr. Dinning, just a question. Whether it\u2019s a \u2013 a married or a single soldier who has fallen, the parents in both cases and the siblings are treated the same. They don\u2019t get a benefit presently?\nMr. Dinning: Correct, yes.\nThe Chairperson: Okay. And you would suggest that, well, that treatment is the same, the parents are treated the same whether a parent of a married or a single person, your position, I would assume, would be that they \u2013 in both cases, they should be provided with a benefit the parents of a married as well as a parent --\nMr. Dinning: No, I\u2019m not saying that at all. No, what I\u2019m saying is keep it the same it is. If you have a wife, she gets paid. If you have dependent children, they get paid, okay. But if there\u2019s no common-law spouse or no wife, right, then the parents get paid because they are the next \u2013 next of kin, the next immediate family.\nThe Chairperson: So in the case of the married soldier --\nMr. Dinning: Mmhmm.\nThe Chairperson: \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be a payment to a parent, there wouldn\u2019t be a \u2011 \u2011\nMr. Dinning: No, no, the wife gets it by all means, yes, yes. No, I\u2019m not saying take anything away, no, no, no. They get it, they keep it, the wife gets it, the common-law spouse if you\u2019ve lived together for the year and met all the criteria, she gets it. If there\u2019s no wife, like for some single soldiers, single as though they\u2019re no married but they have children, well, then the children get it, okay. But if there\u2019s no \u2013 if a single soldier doesn\u2019t have a wife or children, the parents would be eligible to get it or should get it, and I\u2019ll take it a step further. If there\u2019s no parents, then the sibling gets it. And if there\u2019s nobody, absolutely nobody, then the estate gets it, okay.\nBecause one of the gentlemen killed with Matthew, William Turner, didn\u2019t have a mother. He was 40 years old, didn\u2019t have a mother and father, they had already died. He had one sister, okay. Again, single, he doesn\u2019t get it. So in her case, she would be the beneficiary.\nThe Chairperson: Do you anticipate that if that was done, that the parents of married fallen soldiers would be concerned that they weren\u2019t being treated the same way as the parents of single fallen soldiers?\nMr. Dinning: I don\u2019t think anticipate at all because if \u2013 had Matthew been married and had kids, the wife would have got the benefit and we wouldn\u2019t have said a word. I mean, that\u2019s the way it should be. No, there \u2013 I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have parents grumble at that. I mean, they\u2019re married.\nThat \u2013 once you become married and you have kids, then he\u2019s got a different immediate family, right? He\u2019ll still have a mother and father obviously, but if the death benefit goes to them, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get parents grumble. I certainly wouldn\u2019t grumble.\n[23] In his closing submissions, the Complainant argued that the Respondent had discriminated against him and his son by not providing the same opportunity to receive the death benefit under the New Veterans Charter as the parent and brother of a single fallen soldier as would have been the case had he and his son been a spouse, common-law partner or dependent child of a married fallen soldier.\n[24] In its closing submissions, the Commission argued that the Respondent had engaged and was engaging in a discriminatory practice by failing to pay a death benefit to parents of soldiers who suffer service related deaths, regardless of the marital or family status of the deceased soldier. As noted above, the Complainant did not agree with the Commission\u2019s position that the legislation was under inclusive with respect to a married fallen soldier. There was no evidence that the Commission\u2019s position with respect to the alleged under inclusiveness of the legislation for the parents of married fallen soldiers was ever made part of the Complaint or was ever investigated by the Commission or was referred to the Tribunal in this matter.\n[25] It was common ground among the Parties at the hearing that the interpretation of the legislative intent behind the death benefit in the New Veterans Charter was key to the determination of the case on its merits. As pointed out in paragraph 16, the death benefit is not a defined term under the New Veterans Charter but is intended to recognize and compensate a surviving spouse, common-law partner and dependent child of a Canadian Forces member for the non-economic impact of the member\u2019s sudden service related death, which includes the member\u2019s loss of life and the resulting loss of guidance, care and companionship and the impact of the member\u2019s death on the functioning of the household.\n[26] In its submissions at the hearing, I was asked by the Respondent to interpret the purpose of the death benefit as part and parcel of a whole \u201csuite\u201d of benefits in the New Veterans Charter, all of which had been carefully considered, designed and targeted by the Federal Government, as a re-establishment to civilian life program, to assist those particular family members (spouses, common-law partners and dependent children) who normally joined Canadian Forces members in their careers and become part of the \u201cmilitary family\u201d and who are most impacted in terms of their need to re-establish their lives following the sudden service related death of a member. This, in the view of the Respondent, was a perfectly rational and legitimate exercise by Government of properly allocating funds to aid family members most in need and was not a discriminatory practice of excluding other family members such as parents who did not have the same needs. According to the Respondent, in designing and implementing the death benefit legislation, there was no indication either through focus groups or current literature it consulted that parents needed this help.\n[27] Conversely, I was asked by the Commission to interpret the purpose of the death benefit as a lump sum non-economic benefit specifically related to the grief suffered by various surviving family members of fallen soldiers that was clearly distinguishable and different from a re-establishment to civilian life economic benefit provided for by various benefits and programs in other parts of the New Veterans Charter to target the re-establishment needs of a limited group of surviving family members (spouses, common-law partners and dependent children) following the sudden service related death of a member. In the view of the Commission, it was a discriminatory practice to exclude from the payment of the death benefit family members such as parents who also suffer grief from the loss of a son or daughter in the military who dies as a result of a sudden service related injury.\nIII. The Mootness Issue [28] During the hearing, I was advised by the Parties of the existence of a pending application to the Respondent by a Ms. Tanya Lowerison for the death benefit on the basis that she was the common-law partner of Corporal Dinning when he died. I was advised that Ms. Lowerison had previously unsuccessfully made an application for the death benefit but subsequently, as a result of a change to the rules involving the required term for co-habitation during deployment, Ms. Lowerison\u2019s had been allowed to submit a new application that was then under consideration. I advised the parties that the pending application by Ms. Lowerison would have no impact on my deliberations unless, prior to issuing a Decision in this matter, I was informed that Ms. Lowerison\u2019s application was successful.\n[29] On June 10, 2011, the Respondent ruled for the first time that (i) Ms. Lowerison was a \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d and \u201csurvivor\u201d of the late Cpl. Dinning, (ii) her daughter was a \u201cdependent child\u201d of the late Cpl. Dinning, and (iii) a death benefit would therefore be paid to Ms. Lowerison and her daughter, apportioned in accordance with the applicable legislation\n[30] On June 17, 2011 the Complainant wrote to the parties as follows:\nEven though my specific case may be \u201cout the window\u201d there are still 75 single fallen soldiers who will be impacted by his decision. It would also save you going through the same thing all over again should another family pick up where I left off and having a whole new tribunal later on down the road deciding the exact same thing just with a different complainant. (I know at least 3 families who will take up the cause).\nAt no time was evidence adduced in this matter that established the existence of any particular or individual fallen soldier, other than Corporal Dinning, or any particular family members of any such soldier who had indicated to anyone that they would be impacted by a Decision in this matter or who felt that the Respondent was engaging or had engaged in discriminatory behaviour in relation to the death benefit.\n[31] A case conference meeting was held with the parties by telephone on July 13, 2011 to consider submissions with respect to the admission into evidence of the ruling of the Respondent with respect to Ms. Lowerison and her daughter and to receive submissions on the issue of mootness, in the event that the ruling of the Respondent was admitted into evidence.\n[32] At the case management meeting I admitted the ruling of the Respondent into evidence. As a consequence, at the date of Corporal Dinning\u2019s death, he had a survivor under the New Veterans Charter being his common-law partner Ms. Lowerison and a dependent child. As such, the Complainant and his son Brendon were not, as at the date of Corporal Dinning\u2019s death, the father and brother respectively of a single fallen soldier as alleged by the Complainant for the purposes of this case. This does not in any way suggest that the Complainant, at any time, mislead anyone about his or his son\u2019s status since until June 10, 2011, no determination had been made that would have caused Mr. Dinning to believe anything other than what he had alleged in this regard.\n[33] Following the case management meeting on July 13, 2011 the Tribunal wrote to the parties requesting submissions on the following two questions:\n(1) Whether the Complainant\u2019s case for liability against the Respondent is now moot?, and (2) If the answer to question (1) above is yes, whether there can be a finding of liability against the Respondent in this matter in favour of any other person?\n[34] As a result, the Parties provided written submissions to the Tribunal. The Complainant responded on July 17, 2011, the Commission responded on September 9, 2011, the Respondent responded on September 13, 2011. The Commission also provided Reply submissions on September 19, 2011.\n[35] The Complainant\u2019s submissions are summarized in paragraph 30 above.\n[36] The Commission\u2019s submissions are summarized as follows:\n(a) The case on liability is not moot. Under the CHRA, the question referred to the Tribunal for resolution is whether a Respondent has engaged or is engaging in a discriminatory practice. The statute does not require that the Complainant be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the discriminatory practice. Here, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent engages in a discriminatory practice by failing to pay a death benefit to parents and siblings of soldiers who suffer service related deaths, and are single and have no children. The Commission alleges that the Respondent engages in a discriminatory practice by failing to pay a death benefit to parents of soldiers who suffer service related deaths, regardless of the marital or family status of the soldiers. These allegations are unaffected by the Respondent\u2019s decision to pay a death benefit to Tanya Lowerison and her daughter. They are live disputes that can give rise to meaningful public interest remedies, if liability is found.\n(b) In the alternative, if the Tribunal concludes that recent events have rendered the case on liability moot, it should nevertheless exercise its discretion to proceed with the public interest aspects of the case. This is appropriate because, among other things, the case has been fully argued in an adversarial context, involves quasi-constitutional rights of public importance, and relates to specific and ongoing legislation and government action. In addition, deciding the public interest component of the case would support judicial economy by eliminating or reducing the possibility of future legal challenges. It would also respect the principles that human rights laws should be given a broad purposive interpretation, and human rights disputes should be resolved quickly and efficiently.\n(c) While the recent death benefit award should not affect the case for liability or public interest remedies, it does affect the availability of personal financial remedies. In light of the changed circumstances, the Commission now withdraws its prior request for an order that the death benefit be paid, and instead submits that the appropriate order for the Tribunal to make on its theory of the case would be one that (i) finds that the death benefit provisions discriminate on the basis of family status by excluding parents, (ii) orders the Respondent to cease and desist from applying the discriminatory aspects of the provisions, (iii) delays the effect of the inoperability, to allow the Respondent to take steps in consultation with the Commission to address the problem, (iv) leaves the Tribunal seized to supervise implementation of the remedy, and (v) directs that once Parliament has amended the scheme in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, the Respondent pay to the Dinnings whatever benefit the new scheme makes available to parents in their circumstances.\n[37] The Respondent\u2019s submissions are summarized as follows:\n(a) The Complainant\u2019s discrimination allegations may be moot in part or in their entirety depending on what the Tribunal decides is the scope of the complaint.\n(b) If the Tribunal interprets the Complaint in the same way as one having been brought on behalf of the parents and siblings of single CF members who have suffered a sudden service related death, the death benefit award to Corporal Dinning\u2019s common-law partner only renders part of the complaint moot. No longer in controversy is whether Mr. Dinning is a victim of discrimination as the father of a single CF member. The parties agree that, for the purposes of the administration of the death benefit, Mr. Dinning\u2019s son has a common-law partner. However, still in dispute are all the factual and legal questions related to the allegation that other parents and siblings of single CF members have suffered discrimination.\n(c) If the Tribunal concludes, however, that the Complaint is limited to the allegation that the Complainant (or even his wife and son Brendon) has been discriminated against, then the death benefit award renders the Complaint moot in its entirety.\n(d) The Respondent opposes the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to decide a moot issue. None of the three criteria justifying the exercise of discretion apply:\n(i) First, there is no longer an adversarial relationship between the parties. The death benefit award to the common-law partner of Corporal Dinning put an end to it. All parties agree that Corporal Dinning is not single for the purposes of the administration of the death benefit.\n(ii) Second, the need for judicial economy does not favour deciding the moot issue. No special circumstances exist to make it worthwhile for the Tribunal to continue to apply its scarce resources to deciding this issue. A Tribunal decision would have no practical effect on the rights of the parties. There is also no indication that this issue is a reoccurring one that evades review. The death benefit has been enacted for many years and this has been the only complaint on behalf of the parent of single CF member who suddenly died in service. Even if a case arises in the future, it will be preferable to wait until then to decide the issue.\n(iii) Finally, pronouncing on this moot issue will be viewed as the Tribunal intruding on the role of the legislative branch. The Tribunal should not interfere lightly with Parliament\u2019s enactment without the existence of a live dispute which requires adjudication.\nIV. Analysis [38] The classic description and definition of the doctrine of mootness comes from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s judgment in Borowski v. Canada [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342:\n15 The Doctrine of mootness is an aspect of a general policy or practice that a court may decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question. The general principle applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. The general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises its discretion to depart from its policy or practice. The relevant factors relating to the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion are discussed hereinafter.\n16 The approach in recent cases involves a two-step analysis. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. The cases do not always make it clear whether the term \u201cmoot\u201d applies to cases that do not present a concrete controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the court declines to hear. In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is moot if it fails to meet the \u201clive controversy\u201d test. A court may nonetheless elect to address a moot issue if the circumstances warrant.\nIn Collins v. Abrams et al 2002 British Columbia Supreme Court 1774, the Court discusses the 3 rationales underlying the policy and practice of applying the mootness doctrine:\n(1) A court\u2019s competence to resolve legal disputes is rooted in the adversary system, and in the absence of an adversarial context the issues may not be well and fully argued (recognizing that an adversarial context can arise where there are collateral consequences flowing from an already completed cause of action);\n(2) Judicial resources should be conserved for where they are needed (thus, where the court\u2019s decision will have some practical effect on the rights of the parties, where the court\u2019s decision is necessary to ensure that an important question evasive of review will be determined, or where there is an issue of public importance of which a resolution is in the public interest, the expenditure of judicial resources might be justified);\nand\n(3) Courts must remain within their proper law-making function, and pronouncing judgments in the absence of disputes affecting the rights of parties may be viewed as intruding on the sphere of the legislative branch.\nThe case was upheld on appeal by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Collins v. Abrams et al 2004, BCCA 96. See also OHRC v. Burrows and Ontario 2004 HRTO 6.\n[39] It is clear to me that the Complainant\u2019s Complaint on his own behalf and on his son Brendon\u2019s behalf was that the Respondent had engaged in a discriminatory practice by not permitting him or his son the opportunity to claim the death benefit under s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter, as a parent or sibling, on the death of Corporal Dinning, while hypothetically permitting certain family members (spouses, common-law partners and dependent children) of married fallen soldiers the opportunity to collect the death benefit. He obviously did not know at the time that he filed his Complaint or even after the conclusion of the hearing that when Corporal Dinning died he had a common-law partner - Ms. Lowerison and a dependent child. This fact was established by the Ruling of the Respondent of June 10, 2011 under s. 84 of the New Veterans Charter that was accepted into evidence following the hearing. The effect of this Ruling is that neither the Complainant nor his son Brendon is the parent or sibling of a single fallen soldier for the purposes of the New Veterans Charter. As noted earlier, the Complainant\u2019s evidence was that he would not have filed this Complaint or engaged in the hearing if he had known that Corporal Dinning had a common-law partner or a dependent child at the time of his death. His evidence was that his Complaint under s. 5 of the CHRA related to the situation under s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter of a single fallen soldier not to a married fallen soldier.\n[40] In my opinion, a decision by the Tribunal on the merits of this case cannot now have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the Complainant himself and his son Brendon. Events have occurred which affect the relationship of the parties such that no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the Complainant himself and his son Brendon. As such, I find that the Complainant\u2019s Complaint, on behalf of himself and his son, is now moot.\n[41] As a consequence of my finding in paragraph 40, the question then becomes whether there still is a live controversy to support proceeding with a decision on the merits in this matter in relation to any allegation in the Complaint that the Respondent is engaging in or has engaged in a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA, in respect of any other individual or victim, by virtue of the denial of a service (the death benefit) under s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter or is the matter entirely moot?\n[42] Reference in this paragraph should be made to the extracts in paragraph 3 of the CHRA. While purely public interest remedies are available under s. 53 (2) (a) of the CHRA, in addition to the personal remedies in the section, the Act is complaint driven. In the case of a complaint respecting s. 5 of the CHRA, there must first be a complaint filed that alleges that a person has engaged in or is engaging in a discriminatory practice under that section against an individual or victim. This is so, whether the Complainant is the individual or victim (as was previously alleged in this case) or some other individual or victim referred to (though not necessarily identified as a particular individual) on behalf of whom the Complainant has filed the complaint. This is so whether or not consent has been obtained from such other individual or victim under s. 40 (2) of the Act. Only if liability is established in such a complaint, can the public interest remedies be imposed in appropriate circumstances whether or not personal remedies are also sought and imposed. A challenge to the validity or operability of legislation and the application of public interest remedies related thereto as is being pursued in this case, is not permissible under the CHRA, except within the context of this complaint driven process.\n[43] In this case I am being asked to make a decision respecting the validity or operability of important legislative action under s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter in that it is alleged that this section currently is under inclusive with respect to beneficiaries and allows the Respondent to deny a service to individuals on the basis of family or marital status in a discriminatory manner contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA. However, in this case there is now an absence of a dispute affecting the rights of the Complainant himself. As such, a decision would have no practical effect on the rights of the Complainant himself. In such circumstances, based upon the cases referred to above, one must be very careful not to intrude into the role of the legislative branch or waste scarce judicial resources.\n[44] I agree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that in the absence now of a live controversy involving the Complainant himself, the Complaint must be examined carefully to determine whether it sufficiently includes a live controversy involving some other individual or victim allegedly discriminated against by the Respondent in this matter. This is especially important in view of the fact that the validity or operability of legislation is what is now left to be determined in this case.\n[45] In this regard, the Complaint, as quoted from in paragraph 4, refers only to the \u201cfamilies of SINGLE fallen Soldiers\u201d who are being discriminated against. Is this reference sufficient to allow me to proceed with a decision on the merits of this case, involving a challenge to the validity and operability of legislation where the Complainant\u2019s own Complaint is now moot, in view of the following findings of fact?\n(i) Until the Ruling by the Respondent described in paragraph 29, the Complainant focused his case on his own circumstances that he believed to be true - namely, that he was the parent of a single fallen soldier. He did not file the Complaint on the basis that he was an individual unaffected by the legislation who was simply filing a complaint on behalf of unidentified parents or families of single fallen soldiers who were affected by the legislation. In fact, he stated that he would not have filed the Complaint or appeared at the hearing if he had known that his son Corporal Dinning had a common-law partner at the time of his death. It is quite conceivable, under the circumstances, that the Commission in investigating his Complaint did not obtain the consent of other individuals or victims under s. 40 (2) of the CHRA because it too believed that the Complainant was himself a victim.\n(ii) The Complainant did not agree with the Commission\u2019s position respecting the under inclusiveness of s. 57 of the New Veterans Charter vis-a-vis the families of married fallen soldiers. The Complaint was not amended to recognize this allegation and was therefore not part of what was referred to the Tribunal by the Commission and it did not itself commence a complaint on behalf of the families of married fallen soldiers.\n(iii) The Complaint was not brought with the support\/authorization or consent from any family member of any fallen soldier who identified himself as a victim of discrimination as a consequence of the death benefit provision in the New Veterans Charter contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA. The only witnesses other than the Complainant, who appeared at the hearing who were family members of fallen soldiers, gave evidence in support of the Respondent\u2019s case respecting the impact of the death of their father or spouse as immediate family members in a military family. As such, it is unknown whether there are any family members of fallen soldiers who feel that they have been or are being discriminated against or feel that the New Veterans Charter is under inclusive in its definition of survivors and should be amended.\n[46] Based on the foregoing facts and the cases referred to in paragraph 38, I am not satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there are any parties in this matter for whom there is a live controversy now that the Complaint in respect of the Complainant himself is moot. A decision under these circumstances would not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of any party as events have occurred which affect the relationship of the parties such that no live controversy exists. There is a need to ration scarce judicial resources. The mootness doctrine is not applied in situations where to do so would permit certain questions to evade review - not a likely possibility in this case where the legislation has been in place for some time and there is nothing preventing live disputes with respect to it arising which would allow other persons to challenge the impugned provisions. Pronouncing judgments, in the absence of a dispute affecting the rights of the parties, as would be the case here if I were to proceed, would intrude into the role of the legislative branch. This is especially relevant in this case where legislative action is being challenged and it is not clear that there is a public interest.\nV. Order [47] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Complaint is not substantiated as the matter has become entirely moot. The Complaint is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2011-12-05\nNeutral citation\n2011 CHRT 21\nFile number(s)\nT1466\/1210\nDecision-maker(s)\nMarchildon, Sophie\nDecision type\nDecision\nGrounds\nDisability\nDecision Content\nBetween:\nBronwyn Cruden\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nCanadian International Development Agency\n- and -\nHealth Canada\nRespondents\nRuling\nMember: Sophie Marchildon\nDate: December 5, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 21\n[1] On November 24, Counsel on behalf of Ms. Bronwyn Cruden requested a conference call to seek further clarification in the implementation of an order in a September 23, 2011 decision; T1466\/1210 Bronwyn Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada.\n[2] The undersigned requested submissions from all parties in writing, in a letter format to expedite the proceedings since there is urgency to the matter and, decided that it will also be addressed in a letter sent to all parties. I choose, upon review of the submissions, to address it in a ruling format instead of a letter.\n[3] The urgency of the matter relies on the fact that postings for 2012 will be made in the next few weeks and Ms. Cruden is seeking clarification of the timeframe for the implementation of this order.\n[4] The clarification request is made on Paragraph 176 that states that:\nOn this basis, pursuant to paragraph 53(2) (b) of the CHRA, I order CIDA to deploy the complainant in the GPB Branch at the PM06 level and to work with the complainant to post her in a friendly country within her top three choices where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions she will face.\n[5] At issue between the parties is the timing of the requirement that Ms. Cruden be posted to a friendly country within her top three choices where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions.\n[6] Ms. Cruden\u2019 position is that the effect of paragraph 176 is that CIDA is required to find a posting for her in the 2012 posting cycle. Given that the purpose of paragraph 176 is to ameliorate the negative effects of CIDA\u2019s failure to accommodate Ms. Cruden by providing her with a posting in 2009, delaying implementation of the order to 2013 posting will further compound the disadvantage that Ms. Cruden suffered from CIDA\u2019s failure to provide her with a posting in 2009.\n[7] On November 15, 2011, Ms. Cruden provided CIDA with her top three choices for positions in the 2012 posting process that is currently underway. Ms. Cruden identified two positions: Vietnam and Philippines. CIDA acknowledged Ms. Cruden\u2019s interest in Vietnam (first choice after Afghanistan), but CIDA\u2019s position according to Ms. Cruden is that she should put together a career plan.\n[8] Ms. Cruden argues there is no basis for the denial of the posting in 2012 in Vietnam. She has applied to the posting competition currently underway for postings that will take place in 2012. She meets all the essential qualifications and most of the asset qualifications for the position. The experience that CIDA has identified as an asset for the posting, such as experience in program-based approaches, can be provided to Ms. Cruden prior to the commencement of the posting in the fall of 2012.\n[9] Other arguments were made by Ms. Cruden and were taken into consideration.\n[10] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) filed submissions and contends that the complainant is not attempting to change the substance of its initial decision or to implement a different remedy than that which has already been provided. The complainant is seeking clarification of the timeline to implement the order in paragraph 176.\n[11] The Commission contends that the Tribunal is not functus officio because it retained its jurisdiction until remedies are implemented as stated in paragraph 184.\n[12] The Commission submitted caselaw to support the fact that the Tribunal can properly use its power under section 53(2) of the CHRA not only to award effective remedies, but also to retain a broad jurisdiction to return to specified matters to ensure that the ordered remedies are forthcoming. Where the Tribunal has retained jurisdiction to facilitate implementation, it remains open to, among other things, provide further direction that clarifies and supplements the original order.\n[13] The Commission argues that the CHRA is remedial legislation that aims at identifying and eliminating discrimination. In light of this objective, it is important that human rights remedies be effective, consistent with the quasi-constitutional nature of the rights protected. Indeed as the Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held, the \u201cmain approach\u201d of human rights legislation is not to punish the discriminator, \u201c...but rather to provide relief for the victims of discrimination\u2019\u2019.\n[14] The Commission requests that the Tribunal clarify that its remedial order is to be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity presumably the 2012 posting rather than the 2013, unless CIDA provides compelling reasons why the earlier posting is not operationally possible.\n[15] The Commission made other arguments and were taken into consideration.\n[16] CIDA argues that the undersigned is functus officio (\u201chaving discharged one\u2019s duty\u201d), and provided case law to support its position. CIDA contends also that the Tribunal cannot amend the decision. CIDA contends that the Tribunal did not retain its jurisdiction to remain seized on the implementation of this aspect of its order. This can be contrasted with paragraph 169 of the decision where the Tribunal specifically noted that it remained seized of the matter of overtime compensation.\n[17] CIDA contains that in any event, the order is clear and carefully drafted to provide a certain amount of flexibility and discretion on the parties for its implementation is in good faith.\n[18] The order made under section 53(2) (b) of the CHRA which provides that the Tribunal may order that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being denied or were denied the victim as the result of the practice.\n[19] CIDA contends it is not reasonable to post Ms. Cruden in the 2012 cycle because, contrary to her assertions, she does not possess the essential qualifications. CIDA has committed itself to ensuring she attains these qualifications in short order.\n[20] CIDA provided as a response:\nCIDA intends, upon Ms. Cruden\u2019s return from maternity leave in February, 2012, to find her a suitable (operational) position within its GPB Branch. This will serve as a precursor to a field assignment to a friendly country commencing in 2013 wherein CIDA will work with Ms Cruden in 2012 to ensure that she has the appropriate skill sets and knowledge to allow her to succeed in her field posting assignment. To this end a defined learning plan will be elaborated with Ms. Cruden and put into place focusing on elements such as international project\/program management, working with various bilateral programming modalities (such as Program-based approaches, budget support) experience.\n[21] CIDA also contends the postings are very competitive and sought after opportunities. As the complainant testified she has never held an operational\/bilateral position. While a bilateral position does not necessarily qualify employees for a posting, the experience gained in these positions increases their chances for a posting. CIDA has already taken steps to identify which position within the GPB is of interest to the complainant and intends to work with her on a training plan which would give her exposure to all necessary delivery mechanism to prepare her for a posting.\n[22] CIDA made other submissions that were taken into consideration.\nDecision\nIs the tribunal Functus officio in the present matter?\n[23] Paragraph 169 of the decision where the Tribunal specifically noted that it remained seized of the matter of overtime compensation does not exclude the effect of paragraph 184 that mention the following:\nI retain jurisdiction and remain seized of the matter until the parties confirm that the terms of this order, and of any further orders, have been implemented.\n[24] The intent of this paragraph was to retain jurisdiction on all remedies ordered. The mention in paragraph 169 was to ensure submission would be made to submit additional evidence to assist the Tribunal in reaching its decision on that aspect of the case because insufficient evidence was before the Tribunal to make a precise order on the amounts granted to the complainant.\n[25] Pursuant to the principle of functus officio courts cannot, as a general rule, reopen their final decisions except where there has been a slip in drawing it up or there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court (see Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848 at para. 19 [Chandler]). The Supreme Court in Chandler found that the functus officio principle applies to administrative tribunals as well, although \u201c...its application must be more flexible and less formalistic...\u201d (Chandler at para. 21). According to the Supreme Court in Chandler, a decision of the Tribunal can be reopened if there are indications in the CHRA that the Tribunal may do so in order to discharge its functions (see Chandler at para. 22). In addition, the Tribunal can reopen a decision if it failed to dispose of an issue that was fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the Tribunal is empowered by the CHRA to dispose (see Chandler at para. 23). However, the Tribunal cannot revisit a decision because it has changed its mind, made an error within its jurisdiction or because there has been a change of circumstance (see Chandler at para. 20). Furthermore, the fact that one remedy is selected over another alternative remedy does not entitle the Tribunal to reopen proceedings to make another selection (see Chandler at para. 23).\n[26] In Grover v. Canada (National Research Council) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (F.C.) [Grover], the Federal Court held that although the CHRA does not contain an express provision that allows the Tribunal to reopen an inquiry, the wide remedial powers set out therein, coupled with the principle that human rights legislation should be interpreted liberally in a manner that accords full recognition and effect to the rights protected under such legislation, enables the Tribunal to reserve jurisdiction on certain matters in order to ensure that the remedies ordered by the Tribunal are forthcoming to complainants (see Grover at paras. 29-36). The Federal Court added:\nThe integration into the workplace of an employee who has been subjected to discrimination at the hands of his or her employer to a position which he or she would have occupied had the discriminatory practice not taken place is a remedy which is inherently difficult to implement and therefore, may require some supervision. [...] Often it may be more desirable for the Tribunal to provide guidelines in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the reintegration into the workplace, rather than to have an unworkable order forced upon them by the Tribunal.\n[...]\nIt is clear that the Act compels the award of effective remedies and therefore, in certain circumstances the Tribunal must be given the ability to ensure that their remedial orders are effectively implemented. [...] It would frustrate the mandate of the legislation to require the complainant to seek the enforcement of an unambiguous order in the Federal Court or to file a new complaint in order to obtain the full remedy awarded by the Tribunal.\n(Grover at paras. 32-33)\n[27] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Moore, [1998] 4 F.C. 585 [Moore], the Federal Court found that the reasoning in Grover supports the conclusion that the Tribunal has broad discretion to return to a matter and whether that discretion is appropriately exercised by the Tribunal will depend on the circumstances of each case (see Moore at para. 49). In both Grover and Moore, the Court found that the Tribunal had specifically retained jurisdiction to deal with the issues in question in those cases.\n[28] Based on all of the above I find the Tribunal is not functus officio and remains seized of the present question and the implementation of all remedies ordered.\n[29] Thus being said, the intent of paragraph 176 was to place, as close to as possible, the complainant Ms. Cruden, in the position had the discrimination practice not occurred. Its purpose was to also provide parties guidelines in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the reintegration into the workplace, rather than to have an unworkable order forced upon them by the Tribunal.\n[30] Paragraph 176 does leave discretion to CIDA on how to implement the order in consultation with the complainant. The intent was not for the employer to post the complainant where she has no sufficient qualifications for the work requirements. On the other hand, it does not leave discretion to CIDA never to post the complainant to a \u2018friendly country\u2019 on that basis. The employer needs to help the complainant achieve the intent of the remedy to obtain a field posting. Moreover, this applies even if the postings are very competitive and sought after opportunities. The fact that postings are competitive should not prevent CIDA to post the complainant pursuant to section 53 (2) (b): on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being denied or were denied the victim as the result of the practice.\n[31] Thus being said is 2012 the first reasonable occasion or not to post the complainant? Submissions on the issue at hand are contradictory. Ms Cruden contends she does possess the qualifications for a 2012 posting to Vietnam while CIDA finds it premature to do so.\n[32] I recall the complainant testifying she needed the field experience and to be deployed to the GPB Branch to acquire the experience for her career plan, experience she did not have. The decision is also instructive on the evidence heard as to why she was not posted and but for her disability she would have obtained a posting to Afghanistan.\n[33] Without in any way doubting the good faith of the respondent CIDA, having read their submissions and taking notice they already started implementing the order in part, I would request further submissions from both parties on the only issue of qualifications and experience of the complainant for a 2012 posting.\n[34] Since 2012 appears to be the first reasonable occasion to post the complainant if she has the qualifications and experience to do the job why is it unreasonable or reasonable that Ms. Cruden be posted to Vietnam after a few months working in the GPB Branch?\n[35] To help the Tribunal understand the question it would be helpful to obtain a copy of the posting and qualifications and experience required for the 2012 Vietnam posting. I request further submissions from both parties to help me understand the issue at hand.\n[36] I find CIDA in this case, would be in a better position to provide the information first.\n[37] I request the respondent CIDA\u2019s submissions by Friday December 9, 2011 and the complainant Ms. Cruden and the Commission, to file their submissions by December 14, 2011.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 5, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1466\/1210\nStyle of Cause: Bronwyn Cruden v.

Motion. 1\nII........... Background. 1\nIII......... Positions of the Parties. 2\nIV......... Law & Analysis. 4\nI. Motion [1] On September 26, 2011, the Respondent, the Attorney General of Canada representing the Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), filed a motion to consolidate the cases of Roger William Andrews (Tribunal file T16686\/4111) and Roger William Andrews on behalf of his daughter Michelle Dominique Andrews (Tribunal file T1725\/8011). The Respondent\u2019s final reply on this motion was received October 12, 2011. The Complainant in both cases, Mr. Roger William Andrews, is unrepresented and opposes the consolidation of the two cases.\nII. Background [2] The Complainant filed two complaints with the Commission. The first complaint, filed on October 20, 2008, alleges that INAC engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA) on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, family status and age. According to the Complainant, INAC denied his daughter\u2019s application for Indian status because she was born after April 17 1985. This denial of status resulted in her being denied services offered by INAC and it also denied her full access to her culture.\n[3] The second complaint, filed on behalf of the Complainant\u2019s daughter on February 1, 2010, alleges that INAC engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and family status. According to Mr. Andrews, as a result of his father\u2019s enfranchisement, he has status under section 6(2) of the Indian Act, instead of section 6(1) of the Indian Act. Due to his status under section 6(2), he did not receive services, such as health care and educational funding, prior to 1985. Furthermore, as a result of his status under section 6(2), his daughters are being denied status under the Indian Act and the resulting benefits; are not considered part of the First Nations community and culture; and, are being discriminated against.\n[4] Pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the CHRA, the Commission referred the 2008 complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) for inquiry on April 4, 2011. The 2010 complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry on August 11, 2011. The Commission has indicated that it will participate fully in the hearings of both complaints.\n[5] On September 14, 2011, Shirish P. Chotalia, Q.C., the Chairperson of the Tribunal, determined that the Respondent\u2019s motion would be dealt with through written arguments. I was designated by the Chairperson to decide the present motion.\nIII. Positions of the Parties [6] Having carefully reviewed all the materials filed by the parties in support of their positions on this motion, the following is a summary of the positions of the parties.\n[7] According to the Respondent, the Tribunal may institute a single inquiry into several complaints where they involve substantially the same issues of fact and law. In this case, the complaints have common factual and legal issues: both complaints are concerned with the entitlement to Indian registration for Mr. Andrews and his daughter. The nexus between these two complaints is evident in Mr. Andrews\u2019 own words in his 2010 complaint: \u201cthe discrimination that was initially against my father has trickled down to me and my daughters\u201d. Since entitlement to Indian registration is determined on a genealogical standard, Michelle Andrews\u2019s entitlement flows from and depends on that of her father, Mr. Andrews. Whatever factual and legal issues underpin Mr. Andrew\u2019s eligibility necessarily flow through to that of his daughter Michelle.\n[8] The Respondent argues that a single inquiry would avoid the possibility of inconsistent decisions, will be more efficient and will result in the Respondent, the Commission and the Tribunal incurring lower costs than they would for two hearings. The Respondent plans on challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA in both cases and will use similar evidence to support its defense. Both cases are at similar stages of the proceeding and the fact that the 2010 complaint is brought in a representative capacity is of no consequence for the purpose of consolidation. Nothing about consolidation affects the ability of Mr. Andrews to present evidence and make the arguments he wishes to make in his two complaints, and the potential prejudice caused by delay is minor and outweighed by the benefits of consolidation. On the other hand, the Respondent states that proceeding with the complaints separately would mean duplicating potentially voluminous material; having witnesses testify twice; and, an overall significant cost would be incurred by the Respondent. Considering that the underlying policy objective of consolidation is to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and promote the determination of proceedings expeditiously, consistently and inexpensively, the Respondent contends that these factors are met in this case.\n[9] The Commission supports the motion to consolidate the two complaints as it would promote the overall efficiency of the proceedings. The parties to both complaints are the same, and there is no risk that combining the cases will prejudice the Complainant by requiring him to sit through evidence or submissions that are unique to one of the cases. Each party will have a direct interest in all aspects of the combined proceedings. The Commission anticipates that both complaints will require that the Tribunal, among other things to consider:\n\u2022 the history of the Andrews family;\n\u2022 the history and current operation of the status provisions of the Indian Act;\n\u2022 whether the granting of Indian status under the Indian Act is a \u2018\u2019service\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA;\n\u2022 whether the impugned registration provisions are prima facie discriminatory for reasons relating to the past enfranchisement of the Complainant\u2019s father;\n\u2022 whether the respondent can prove a bona fide justification under s.15 of the CHRA; and,\n\u2022 if the Tribunal finds that the impugned aspects of the registration are discriminatory, and have no bona fide justification, what remedies can be awarded.\n[10] The Commission acknowledges that the 2008 complaint raises an issue that is not expressly raised in the 2010 complaint, namely the impact of the second generation cut-off rule. However, complaints do not have to be precisely identical to proceed together. Combining the two complaints will not prevent the Complainant from raising all the arguments he wishes to raise in connection with the complaint filed on behalf of his daughter.\n[11] The Complainant opposes the consolidation of his two complaints. According to him, the two complaints are very different and different laws are being questioned. The only overlap is enfranchisement. The Complainant fears that the enfranchisement question will overshadow the important challenge to the registration system\u2019s \u201csecond generation cut-off\u201d. According to the Complainant, the Commission\u2019s Statement of Particulars already indicates a focus on enfranchisement as a major issue. The Complainant argues that it would be unfair to First Nations people to set aside the issue of the registration system\u2019s \u201csecond generation cut-off\u201d. First Nations people deserve a clear decision regarding both issues and not a hybridized one that would likely cause confusion. Even the smallest chance that confusion could occur should be enough to keep these two complaints separate. According to the Complainant, consolidation will not save time and money, because someone else might challenge the registration section of the Indian Act if it is not dealt with now. In this regard, processing a new complaint would require the Commission to spend additional time and money.\nIV. Law & Analysis [12] Pursuant to section 40(4) of the CHRA, it is the Commission who has the power to determine whether complaints should be dealt with together through a single inquiry by the Tribunal. However, the issue of whether to hold a single hearing or multiple hearings is a procedural matter (see Lattey v. Canadian Pacific Railway, (February 25, 2002), TD 1 (CHRT) at para. 12 [Lattey]). With regards to procedure, section 48.9(2) of the CHRA provides that the Chairperson of the Tribunal may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal. Furthermore, section 48.9(1) indicates that proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. Together, these two sections indicate that, as long as its procedure is fair, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure. Therefore, the Tribunal can determine whether a single hearing or multiple hearings should be held with regards to the two complaints in issue here.\n[13] In Lattey, in determining whether the complaints in issue in that case should be heard together, the Tribunal identified that it must balance a number of factors, including:\n(1) The public interest in avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, including considerations of expense, delay, the convenience of the witnesses, reducing the need for the repetition of evidence, and the risk of inconsistent results;\n(2) The potential prejudice to the respondent [in this case-the complainant-who opposes the consolidation] that could result from a single hearing, including the lengthening of the hearing for each respondent as issues unique to the other respondent are dealt with, and the potential for confusion that may result from the introduction of evidence that may not relate to the allegations specifically involving one respondent or the other; and\n(3) Whether there are common issues of fact or law.\n(see Lattey at para. 13)\n[14] Considering the circumstances of these two complaints, I find that hearing both complaints of discrimination together would expedite the proceedings and would be in the public interest. Although there may be different questions of law raised in the two complaints, I accept that these questions are intertwined and that evidence on these issues will necessarily overlap. Furthermore, both complaints share a similar factual underpinning. Therefore, hearing both complaints together would give the Tribunal a clear historical and factual context to the complaints, which will form the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on each legal and factual question. Having a clear historical and factual context to the complaints will also reduce the risk of inconsistencies between the analysis of two complaints. Also on this point, considering that the parties to both complaints are the same, there will be no confusion in the introduction of evidence related to only one of the complaints as per the second factor outlined in Lattey. Finally, both complaints are at similar stages of the inquiry, and any delay with consolidating the hearings can be reduced through active case management.\n[15] I do not agree that hearing both complaints together will cause confusion for First Nations people with regards to the issues raised in each complaint. Each party will have an ample opportunity to present their case regarding both complaints. While the hearing of the complaints will proceed together, the Tribunal will consider the issues raised in each complaint separately and will provide reasons for its decision regarding each complaint based on the evidence adduced by the parties.\n[16] For all the above reasons, the motion to consolidate the two complaints for the purpose of a single hearing is granted.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 8, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1686\/4111 & T1725\/8011\nStyle of Cause: Roger William Andrews v.

Law.. 3\nV........... Analysis. 7\nI. Introduction [1] In file T1311\/4108, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) held a hearing on June 1-2, 2009 and rendered a decision on July 27, 2009: Detra Berberi v. Attorney General of Canada, 2009 CHRT 21 [Berberi]. The Complainant now requests that the Tribunal convene a hearing in relation to a remedial offer which was made and accepted during the course of the June 2009 hearing. The Complainant claims that she has not received the benefit of that remedial offer.\nII. Background [2] In Berberi, the Complainant alleged that she was denied a CR-04 position with the RCMP because of her disability and past absenteeism, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. The RCMP admitted that its decision not to employ the Complainant was based in part on a perceived disability. The hearing into her complaint proceeded on the issue of remedy alone. At the hearing, the RCMP offered the Complainant a CR-04 position, which she accepted. The Tribunal noted this in its decision as follows:\n[3] [32] At the hearing, the RCMP offered Ms. Berberi an indeterminate CR-04 finance\/administrative position at the RCMP detachment in Milton, which is one of her preferred locations. The only condition was that Ms. Berberi obtain a top secret security clearance. The RCMP also offered to conduct a functional ability assessment and provide the necessary accommodations to ensure that she succeeds in this position.\n[4] [33] Ms. Berberi accepted this offer and agreed that this satisfied her remedy request for a permanent position with the RCMP. The parties agreed that no order from the Tribunal was necessary.\n[5] The Complainant was denied compensation for lost wages, willful or reckless conduct, and other expenses, but received compensation for pain and suffering and legal expenses.\n[6] Ms. Berberi filed an application for judicial review with the Federal Court. Among other things, Ms. Berberi argued that the Tribunal had erred in assuming that the RCMP would act in good faith in honouring the job offer. In Berberi v. Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and Attorney General of Canada (RCMP), 2011 FC 485, the Federal Court stated:\n[63] In my opinion, the answer to this issue lies in the Tribunal\u2019s acknowledgement at paragraph 33 of the decision that the \u201cparties agreed that no order from the Tribunal was necessary\u201d relative to the job offer that was made by the RCMP and accepted by the Applicant.\n[64] The Applicant was represented by counsel at the hearing before the Tribunal. She had the option of requesting an order. She did not do so.\n[65] The responsibilities of the Tribunal were discharged once the issues of remedy, including compensation for pain and suffering and a contribution towards legal fees, were adjudicated. The Applicant is at liberty to seek an order from the Tribunal with respect to implementation of the remedy. She has failed to show that the Tribunal made any assumptions on the basis of any error, and this argument is dismissed.\n[7] Ultimately, Ms. Berberi\u2019s application for judicial review was denied and she has filed an appeal of that decision with the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[8] On July 15, 2011, the Complainant made the present request to the Tribunal. The parties were given an opportunity to make submissions on the request and were offered mediation in an attempt to settle the dispute. However, mediation was declined.\nIII. Positions of the parties [9] The Complainant argues that the remedial offer, when accepted, formed part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. As a matter of natural justice and ensuring the adjudicative and institutional integrity of the Tribunal, the Complainant claims that it is necessary and consistent with the purpose of the Act that the Tribunal posses the jurisdiction to superintend over the conduct of the parties in relation to remedial proposals made and accepted during the course of proceedings before it.\n[10] In the alternative, the Complainant submits that the hearing into this complaint should be resumed as the complaint has not been properly or fully adjudicated. According to the Complainant, the Respondent\u2019s unwillingness to fulfill the terms of the remedial offer renders nugatory Ms. Berberi\u2019s agreement at the hearing not to pursue an order for a permanent position with the RCMP. In the further alternative, the Complainant submits that this request should be considered as a new application that alleges the continuation of the discriminatory conduct which the Respondent has already admitted to.\n[11] Both the Respondent and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) submit that the Tribunal is functus officio with respect to this matter. The Tribunal issued a final order\/decision and, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to deal with the matter was exhausted. However, both the Respondent and the Commission agree that the remedial offer formed part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\nIV. Law [12] Pursuant to the principle of functus officio, courts cannot, as a general rule, reopen their final decisions except where there has been a slip in drawing it up or there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court (see Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848 at para. 19 [Chandler]). In Chandler, the Supreme Court found that the functus officio principle applied to administrative tribunals as well, although \u201c...its application must be more flexible and less formalistic...\u201d (Chandler at para. 21). A decision of the Tribunal can be reopened if there are indications in the Act that the Tribunal may do so in order to discharge its functions (see Chandler at para. 22). In addition, the Tribunal can reopen a decision if it failed to dispose of an issue that was fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the Tribunal is empowered by the Act to dispose (see Chandler at para. 23). However, the Tribunal cannot revisit a decision because it has changed its mind, made an error within its jurisdiction or because there has been a change of circumstance (see Chandler at para. 20). Furthermore, the fact that one remedy is selected over another alternative remedy does not entitle the Tribunal to reopen proceedings to make another selection (see Chandler at para. 23).\n[13] In Grover v. Canada (National Research Council) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (F.C.) [Grover], an application for judicial review of a Tribunal decision, the Federal Court had to decide whether the Tribunal had the power to reserve jurisdiction with regards to a remedial order. The Tribunal had ordered that the complainant be appointed to a specific job, but retained jurisdiction to hear further evidence with regards to the implementation of the order. The Federal Court held that although the Act does not contain an express provision that allows the Tribunal to reopen an inquiry, the wide remedial powers set out therein, coupled with the principle that human rights legislation should be interpreted liberally, in a manner that accords full recognition and effect to the rights protected under such legislation, enables the Tribunal to reserve jurisdiction on certain matters in order to ensure that the remedies ordered by the Tribunal are forthcoming to complainants (see Grover at paras. 29-36). The Federal Court added:\n[14] It is clear that the Act compels the award of effective remedies and therefore, in certain circumstances the Tribunal must be given the ability to ensure that their remedial orders are effectively implemented. Therefore, the remedial powers in subsection 53(2) should be interpreted as including the power to reserve jurisdiction on certain matters in order to ensure that the remedies ordered by the Tribunal are forthcoming to complainants. The denial of such a power would be overly formalistic and would defeat the remedial purpose of the legislation. In the context of a rather complex remedial order, it makes sense for the Tribunal to remain seized of jurisdiction with respect to remedial issues in order to facilitate the implementation of the remedy. This is consistent with the overall purpose of the legislation and with the flexible approach advocated by Sopinka J. in Chandler, supra. It would frustrate the mandate of the legislation to require the complainant to seek the enforcement of an unambiguous order in the Federal Court or to file a new complaint in order to obtain the full remedy awarded by the Tribunal. (Grover at para. 33)\n[15] Similarly, in Canada (Attorney General) v. Moore, [1998] 4 F.C. 585 [Moore], the Federal Court had to determine whether the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by reconsidering and changing a cease and desist order. Having found the complaint to be substantiated, the Tribunal made a general direction in its order and gave the parties the opportunity to work out the details of the order while the Tribunal retained jurisdiction. After examining the reasoning in Grover and Chandler, the Federal Court stated:\n[16] The reasoning in these cases supports the conclusion that the Tribunal has broad discretion to return to a matter and I find that it had discretion in the circumstances here. Whether that discretion is appropriately exercised by the Tribunal will depend on the circumstances of each case. That is consistent with the principle set out in Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, relied upon by the applicant, which dealt with the decision of a board other than the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. (Moore at para. 49)\n[17] The Federal Court determined that the Tribunal had reserved jurisdiction and there was no indication that the Tribunal viewed its decision as final and conclusive in a manner that would preclude it from returning to a matter included in the order. Therefore, on the authority of Grover, the Federal Court concluded that subsection 53(2) of the Act empowered the Tribunal to reopen the proceedings (see Moore at para. 50).\n[18] The Tribunal jurisprudence that has considered the functus officio principle and interpreted Grover and Moore, has generally found that absent a reservation of jurisdiction from the Tribunal on an issue, the Tribunal\u2019s decision is final unless an exception to the functus officio principle can be established (see Douglas v. SLH Transport Inc., 2010 CHRT 25; Walden v. Canada (Social Development), 2010 CHRT 19; Warman v. Beaumont, 2009 CHRT 32; and, Goyette v. Voyageur Colonial Lt\u00e9e, (November 16, 2001), TD 14\/01 (CHRT)). However, recent Federal Court jurisprudence, decided several years after Grover and Moore and which examined the authority of the Commission to reconsider its decisions, provides further guidance on the application of the functus officio principle to administrative tribunals and commissions.\n[19] In Kleysen Transport Ltd. v. Hunter, 2004 FC 1413 [Kleysen], the Commission had investigated a complaint and the investigator recommended that the complaint be dismissed. However, the Commission failed to consider some of the complainant\u2019s submissions. The Commission then reconsidered the complaint and referred it to the Tribunal. The respondent sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s actions. The Federal Court found that nothing in the Act gave the Commission the power to reconsider its decisions, however, \u201cthe Commission clearly possesses a very broad discretion to screen and process complaints\u201d (see Kleysen at para. 8). The Federal Court also examined the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in Zutter v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (1995), 122 D.L.R. (4th) 665 (B.C.C.A.) [Zutter]. In Zutter, the British Columbia Council of Human Rights had also failed to consider a submission from a complainant and the British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the Council had the power to reconsider the complaint in that circumstance. The Court in Zutter, in addition to examining the Council\u2019s enabling statute, also looked at the overall context of the situation and found that the absence of any right of appeal of the Council\u2019s decision and the fact that the Council was trying to correct an unfairness were contextual factors supporting the power of the Council to reconsider its decision. The Court in Zutter also considered the broad purposes of human rights legislation and stated \u201cit would be an unfortunate irony if the Council, whose very existence and remedial purpose is characterized by the fundamental values of fairness and justice, nonetheless lacked the jurisdiction to remedy that unfairness\u201d (Zutter at para. 23). In consideration of Zutter and Chandler, the Federal Court in Kleysen found as follows:\nHere, the Commission decided to reconsider its initial decision when it realized that it had overlooked some of Mr. Hunter's materials. Had it not done so, Mr. Hunter might well have brought an application for judicial review, arguing that the Commission had treated him unfairly by failing to consider all of his submissions. In my view, the Commission rightly decided to consider whether its initial decision was well-founded in light of the new submissions rather than burden Mr. Hunter with the onus of bringing an application in this Court. (Kleysen at para. 12)\n[20] In Merham v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2009 FC 1127 [Merham], the complainant sought judicial review of a Commission decision. The Commission decided not to reconsider its prior decision based on new information, as the information did not demonstrate a link to a prohibited ground of discrimination. In determining that the Commission\u2019s decision was reasonable, the Federal Court affirmed that the Commission has the power to reconsider its decisions. Specifically, after considering Kleysen, Zutter and Chandler, the Federal Court stated:\nConsequently, the above case law leads me to conclude that the Commission has the power to reconsider its decisions, but this is a discretionary power which must be used sparingly in exceptional and rare circumstances. (Merham at para. 25)\nV. Analysis [21] The application of the functus officio principle to administrative tribunals must be flexible and not overly formalistic (see Chandler at para. 21). In Grover, in determining whether the Tribunal could supervise the implementation of its remedial orders, the Federal Court recognized that the Tribunal has the power to retain jurisdiction over its remedial orders to ensure that they are effectively implemented. In Moore, in deciding whether the Tribunal could reconsider and change a remedial order, the Federal Court expanded on the reasoning in Grover and stated that \u201cthe Tribunal has broad discretion to return to a matter\u2026\u201d (Moore at para. 49). Consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Chandler, the Federal Court added that \u201cwhether that discretion is appropriately exercised by the Tribunal will depend on the circumstances of each case\u201d (Moore at para. 49). In Grover and Moore, while the retention of jurisdiction by the Tribunal was a factor considered by the Federal Court in determining whether the Tribunal appropriately exercised its discretion to return to a matter, ultimately, it was not the only factor considered by the Court. In addition to examining the context of each case, the Tribunal must also consider whether \u201cthere are indications in the enabling statute that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation\u201d (Chandler at para. 22). This method of analyzing the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to return to a matter is consistent with the Federal Court\u2019s reasoning in Kleysen and Merham. The question then becomes: considering the Act and the circumstances of the case, should the Tribunal return to the matter in order to discharge the function committed to it by the Canadian Human Rights Act?\n[22] The primary focus of the Act is to \u201c\u2026identify and eliminate discrimination\u201d (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13). In this regard, subsection 53(2) of the Act grants the Tribunal broad remedial discretion to eliminate discrimination when a complaint of discrimination is substantiated (see Grover at para. 31). Therefore, as the Federal Court has stated, \u201csubsection 53(2) should be interpreted in a manner which best facilitates the compensation of those subject to discrimination\u201d (Grover at para. 32). The Act does not provide a right of appeal of Tribunal decisions, and judicial review is not the appropriate forum to seek out the implementation of a Tribunal decision. As the Federal Court indicated to the Complainant: \u201cThe Applicant is at liberty to seek an order from the Tribunal with respect to implementation of the remedy\u201d (Berberi v. Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and Attorney General of Canada (RCMP), 2011 FC 485 at para. 65). When the Tribunal makes a remedial order under subsection 53(2), that order can be made an order of the Federal Court for the purposes of enforcement under section 57 of the Act. Section 57 allows decisions of the Tribunal to \u201c\u2026be enforced on their own account through contempt proceedings because they, like decisions of the superior Courts, are considered by the legislator to be deserving of the respect which the contempt powers are intended to impose\u201d (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2011 FCA 297 at para. 44). However, as the Federal Court has stated: \u201cIt would frustrate the mandate of the legislation to require the complainant to seek the enforcement of an unambiguous order in the Federal Court or to file a new complaint in order to obtain the full remedy awarded by the Tribunal\u201d (Grover at para. 33). With this legislative framework in mind, I turn to the specific circumstances under which the Complainant asks the Tribunal to return to her matter.\n[23] In this case, the Complainant is not challenging the finality of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. The validity or correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s decision is not in issue, nor is the Complainant asking the Tribunal to change any of the remedies that are outlined in the Tribunal\u2019s decision. Rather, she is asking the Tribunal for an opportunity to argue for the effective implementation of a remedial offer, which all the parties agree, formed part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in this matter. In this sense, the remedial offer was not in the nature of a private settlement between the parties. As the complaint was substantiated, the Tribunal had the power to make the remedial offer an order under section 53(2) of the Act, but the parties agreed that such an order was not necessary (see Berberi at para. 33). That being said, would it not be overly formalistic to deny a victim of discrimination the opportunity to seek the effective implementation of a remedy for the sole reason that the Tribunal did not make the remedy into an \u201corder\u201d. Although the Tribunal left it to the parties to implement the remedy, it no doubt expected that the remedy would be forthcoming to the Complainant. Furthermore, the Tribunal addressed the remedy in its reasons and laid out the conditions thereof (see Berberi at para. 32). However, without an order from the Tribunal, the Complainant is left without an enforcement mechanism regarding the remedial offer. Given that the Tribunal\u2019s remedial powers should be interpreted in a manner \u201c...which best facilitates the compensation of those subject to discrimination\u201d (Grover at para. 32) and given that the Act \u201c...compels the award of effective remedies\u2026\u201d (Grover at para. 33), it would defeat the remedial purposes of the Act to deny the victim of discrimination in this case the opportunity to return to her matter to argue for the effective implementation of the remedial offer. Similar to the reasoning of the Court in Zutter, it would be an unfortunate irony if the Tribunal, whose very existence and remedial purpose is characterized by the fundamental values of fairness and justice, nonetheless lacked the jurisdiction to remedy a potential unfairness (see Zutter at para. 23). Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds that it has the jurisdiction to return to the matter to address questions related to the implementation of the remedial offer. The Tribunal will convene a case conference call between the parties to determine how this matter will proceed.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

Introduction [1] The complainant, Paul Marchand, is a former member of the Canadian Forces (CF). In 2007, he applied to the respondent, the Department of National Defence (DND), to be employed in one of several temporary or indeterminate full-time cleaner positions at the Canadian Forces Base in Shilo, Manitoba (CFB Shilo). Several women were ultimately appointed to the positions and he was not hired. Mr. Marchand claims that DND refused to employ him because he is a man. He alleges that in so doing, DND engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[2] In the following decision, I find that based solely on Mr. Marchand\u2019s understanding and presentation of the facts relating to these appointments, he established on a prima facie basis that DND\u2019s failure to hire him was discriminatory. However, once all of the evidence regarding the appointments is taken into account, I conclude that DND has provided a reasonable and non-pretextual explanation. In particular, the evidence reveals that the temporary appointments were made after Mr. Marchand had already been screened out of the process due to his own failure to demonstrate on his application that he possessed the essential qualifications for the positions. With respect to the indeterminate position, the evidence shows that the person who was selected was assessed as a better candidate (or \u201cright fit\u201d) for the job. Mr. Marchand\u2019s sex was not a factor in the decision not to appoint him.\nII. Mr. Marchand\u2019s Evidence [3] Mr. Marchand was not represented by counsel and he did not have anyone other than himself testify at the hearing.\nA. Mr. Marchand\u2019s work history [4] Mr. Marchand joined the CF in 1981 and was based for most of his career at CFB Shilo. He loved his work in the military but unfortunately had to retire in 1990, due to a work-related injury. By this time, he considered Shilo as his home and he sought work at the base after he left the CF.\n[5] Immediately following his retirement, he worked as a cleaner at the base for about five years in total, either on a casual basis or for a number of terms. His employer on these occasions was the German Army Training Establishment at Shilo (GATES), which was an operation administered by the German military that was using DND\u2019s facilities at Shilo. Over the same period, Mr. Marchand had applied for several indeterminate positions with DND at CFB Shilo but was never selected. He believes that there was favouritism involved in these employment processes and he eventually gave up applying for work there.\n[6] After this initial period of employment on-site at the base, Mr. Marchand began working elsewhere in the Shilo\/Brandon area, at a number of different jobs. Around 2005, however, he returned to work full-time as a cleaner at CFB Shilo. He was employed by a cleaning company that had a cleaning contract with DND. The company was owned by Cindy Brown, who is also employed by DND as the base accommodation supervisor at CFB Shilo. It is Ms. Brown who served as the technical expert and manager on the assessment board that dealt with the appointments that are at issue in this complaint.\n[7] When another cleaning company took over the cleaning contract in 2006, it hired Mr. Marchand. As of the date of the hearing, he was still working for this company as a supervisor of cleaning operations at CFB Shilo.\nB. Mr. Marchand\u2019s job application [8] In March 2007, Mr. Marchand saw a posting on a bulletin board at CFB Shilo for three temporary full-time cleaner positions with DND, classified as GS-BUS-02. The advertisement stated that any person residing or employed in Shilo, Manitoba or within a 100km radius of the city, could apply. The process was therefore external and not just limited to existing DND employees.\n[9] The advertisement stated that job applicants had to apply on-line by computer. Hard copy applications, by fax or mail, were not accepted. Mr. Marchand applied from a computer that he accessed on the base. He testified that he was unable to properly fill out the application because he is not skilled in the use of computers. He described the process as so difficult that even those familiar with computers had a hard time completing the on-line form. He suspects that only portions of his application managed to be sent.\n[10] A table generated from the information provided on-line by the candidates was used by DND\u2019s human resources staff to determine whether to screen them into the process. Mr. Marchand pointed out that the table relating to his application indicates he does not meet the essential criteria of experience in commercial cleaning and the use of various commercial cleaning equipment. He testified that this information is clearly wrong since at the time he applied, he had been working at the base as a cleaner, either as a casual employee or as an employee for a contractor, for almost two decades. Mr. Marchand pointed to this discrepancy as evidence that he was incapable of completing his application properly on line.\n[11] After filing his application, and sensing that it was incomplete, Mr. Marchand went to DND\u2019s human resources office to try to submit a hard copy of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He met with human resources officer, Shannon Barnes-Girourd, who advised him that this option was not available. He could only file it on-line.\n[12] He was so upset with DND\u2019s response that he spoke to his Member of Parliament (MP) to complain about this policy. Several days later, Ms. Barnes-Girouard contacted him to explain that there was a flaw in the system and that DND would now accept his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in paper form. Mr. Marchand suspects that DND changed its position due to an intervention by his MP.\n[13] Mr. Marchand followed through and filed his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in paper form. He was then invited to an interview, which was conducted by Ms. Brown, Ms. Barnes-Girouard and a third individual, who is not employed by DND but rather by the Canadian Forces Personnel Support Program. Mr. Marchand testified that he answered several questions relating to commercial cleaning. He felt the interview went well. To his knowledge, he was the only candidate to have been interviewed by three persons instead of two. He questions why he was singled out in this way.\n[14] Following the interview, Mr. Marchand heard from some of the cleaners at work that a woman (Dawn Cyr) had already been appointed to an indeterminate cleaner position even prior to his interview. He claims that he always suspected that Ms. Cyr would be hired. He testified that after learning of her appointment, he went to the human resources office and asked why he had not been notified of the outcome. The evidence suggests that this meeting took place on August 29, 2007. A human resources assistant, Rebecca Moorehead, informed him that although the employer was not required to notify him personally of Ms. Cyr\u2019s appointment, a letter regarding the appointment process had in fact been mailed to him more than two months earlier, on June 6, 2007.\n[15] Several days after the meeting, he received a copy of that letter, which informed him that he was found qualified under the selection process and that his name had been placed in a pool of qualified candidates from which he may be contacted for future vacancies should they arise. The letter was accompanied by a cover sheet signed by Ms. Moorehead dated August 29, 2007, in which she explained that her office had mistakenly reversed the numbers of Mr. Marchand\u2019s post office box on the June 6th letter. It had not, however, been returned to DND and they were therefore unaware that he had never received it. Both letters were filed in evidence and Mr. Marchand confirmed in his testimony that his address had been mistyped on the June 6th letter.\n[16] Mr. Marchand testified that despite being placed in the pool of qualified candidates, he has never been contacted to fill any vacancies. On the other hand, he is aware of two women (Amanda Pero and Vicki Carriere) who have been selected from the pool to work from time to time on a temporary basis. He questions how Ms. Carriere was chosen given that she does not hold a driver\u2019s licence, which he understands to be an essential qualification for the cleaner position at the base.\n[17] To Mr. Marchand\u2019s knowledge, all but one of the ten cleaners employed on an indeterminate basis by DND are women, and the sole man is nearing retirement. The only other men that he has seen employed over the years, worked for GATES, not DND. He claimed in his testimony that since Ms. Brown began managing the cleaning services for DND at CFB Shilo, only women have been hired as indeterminate employees. He admitted in his evidence that he does not know how many men, if any, applied on the 2007 appointment process along with him, but he claims that males will generally not even bother to apply because they know that Ms. Brown will not hire them.\nIII. Analysis A. What is the law regarding Mr. Marchand\u2019s claim of discrimination? [18] It is a discriminatory practice under the CHRA to refuse to employ a person on the basis of his sex (ss. 3 and 7(a)). A complainant must first establish a prima facie (literally, \u201cat first face\u201d) case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28). A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to disprove the allegations or provide some other reasonable explanation.\n[19] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\n[20] In Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38481 (CHRT), the Tribunal stated that discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances to determine if there exists a \"subtle scent of discrimination\".\n[21] A number of decisions have served to illustrate what type of evidence is needed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination depending on the circumstances of the particular case. In the case of complaints alleging that an employer has refused to employ the complainant, the Ontario Board of Inquiry held, in Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 at para. 8918, that a prima facie case could be established by demonstrating:\n\u2022 that the complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\n\u2022 that the complainant was not hired; and\n\u2022 that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen (or basis) of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\nB. Has Mr. Marchand established a prima facie case that DND committed a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the CHRA, in refusing to employ Mr. Marchand? [22] I am satisfied that Mr. Marchand has established a prima facie case that DND\u2019s refusal to employ him as a cleaner in the course of the appointment processes conducted in 2007 constituted a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the CHRA. The evidence he presented in support of his allegations, if believed, would be complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in his favour, absent an explanation from DND.\n[23] Given that the complainant testified that he applied for a position with DND but was not hired, it is appropriate to apply the Shakes test to this case. Regarding the first element of the test, there is convincing evidence that Mr. Marchand is qualified for the position of cleaner. He testified that he worked as a cleaner in the facilities of CFB Shilo for at least 15 years. Moreover, DND itself confirmed in its letter to Mr. Marchand that he had been qualified in the appointment process and that his name had been placed in a pool of qualified candidates from which he could be contacted for future vacancies. In its final submissions, DND did not dispute that Mr. Marchand was qualified. I therefore find that Mr. Marchand was qualified for the cleaner position.\n[24] With respect to the second part of the Shakes test, Mr. Marchand testified that he was not selected by DND for the full-time indeterminate or term positions for which he had applied.\n[25] Regarding the third component of the Shakes test, based on the evidence led by Mr. Marchand, the person hired to the indeterminate position (Ms. Cyr) and the others who were selected for term employment are women. Indeed, according to Mr. Marchand, over the last 20 years or more, DND has only hired women to indeterminate full-time cleaner positions at CFB Shilo such that nine out of the ten cleaners employed in these positions are women.\n[26] However, Mr. Marchand must also establish that the women who were appointed from the process in which he participated were no better qualified than him? The posted advertisement for the positions contained a statement of essential merit criteria that candidates were required to meet in order to be qualified for the position. The assessment board found that Mr. Marchand met these requirements and he was placed in the qualified pool of candidates, presumably along with Ms. Cyr and the other women who were selected. He was thus at least as qualified as these women or, to paraphrase Shakes, the women who were hired were no better qualified than him. I am satisfied that the third aspect of the test has been met.\n[27] I therefore find that the evidence led by Mr. Marchand is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in his favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\nC. Has DND provided a reasonable explanation for its decision not to hire Mr. Marchand? [28] DND concedes that Mr. Marchand was, and remains, qualified in the pool for the cleaner positions at CFB Shilo, from which he has yet to be hired. It also acknowledges that the women who have been hired as a result of the appointment processes in which Mr. Marchand participated were no better qualified than him. DND submits, however, that Mr. Marchand\u2019s sex was not a factor in the decision not to select him for employment. Instead, DND contends that those women were appointed because they were the \u201cright fit\u201d for the organization at that time, in accordance with the applicable staffing rules for the federal public service.\n[29] Section 30(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, S.C., 2003, c. 22, ss. 12, 13 (PSEA) provides that appointments to, or from within, the public service must be made on the basis of merit and free from political influence. As the Public Service Staffing Tribunal noted in Tibbs v. Deputy Minister of National Defence, 2006 PSST 8 at para. 63, the PSEA provides managers with considerable discretion to choose the person for appointment who not only meets the essential qualifications for the position, but is the \u201cright fit\u201d because of additional asset qualifications, current or future needs, and\/or operational requirements (see also Visca v. Deputy Minister of Justice, 2007 PSST 24 at para. 42).\n[30] DND filed into evidence numerous documents related to the appointments at issue and called several witnesses who were involved in the appointment processes. Mr. Marchand was likely unaware of this evidence and the intricacies of public service staffing when he filed his complaint. This evidence, however, supports the respondent\u2019s explanation for not having hired Mr. Marchand and demonstrates that the explanation is reasonable and non-pretextual.\n(i) The first appointment process \u2013 temporary full time positions [31] In early 2007, Ms. Brown determined that several extra cleaners needed to be hired at the base, on a term basis. She and Ms. Barnes-Girouard, the human resources officer, initiated an appointment process, as a result of which the job advertisement that Mr. Marchand saw posted on a bulletin board was prepared. The assessment board was made up of Ms. Brown and Ms. Barnes-Girouard. Ms. Brown testified that the intended outcome of the process was the establishment of a pool of qualified candidates from which positions that would be opening up could be staffed.\n[32] The advertisement stated that three temporary full time vacancies were to be filled. Candidates had until March 6, 2007, to apply. The advertisement was amended two weeks later, to no longer require possession of a Class 5 driver\u2019s licence as an essential qualification for the position. As a result applicants now had until March 19, 2007, to file their applications. Anyone who had responded to the first advertisement was automatically included in the modified process.\n[33] A total of 45 applications were ultimately received, 32 from women and 13 from men. 14 of those candidates cleared the initial screening into the process (12 women and two men). On March 27 and 28, 2007, the board interviewed these candidates. With the assistance of human resources staff, Ms. Brown had developed the questions that were asked of all candidates. Following the interviews, the candidates\u2019 references were consulted and verified.\n[34] Within a week, the board had completed its assessment of the candidates and on April 4, 2007, it sent letters to 11 of the screened in candidates (nine women and two men), including Ms. Cyr, Ms. Pero, and Ms. Carriere, informing them that they met the essential qualifications outlined for the selection process and that their names had therefore been placed in a pool of qualified candidates. They were also advised that they may be contacted for future vacancies should they arise.\n[35] On April 12, 2007, Ms. Barnes-Girouard sent a letter to Ms. Cyr offering her the first of the positions that the board was staffing under the appointment process, for a term ending on February 1, 2008. The board\u2019s interview notes were filed in evidence. Both Ms. Barnes\u2011Girouard\u2019s and Ms. Brown\u2019s assessments of Ms. Cyr\u2019s answers during the interview ranged from very good to excellent (the top two available ratings). Ms. Brown produced the notes from the follow-up reference checks that she conducted with respect to Ms. Cyr. She described the references as \u201cexcellent all around\u201d. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that Ms. Cyr demonstrated in the interview that she was thoroughly prepared and provided \u201cstrong\u201d responses.\n[36] Similar letters were also sent on April 12, 2007, to Ms. Pero and Ms. Carriere, offering them appointments to cleaner positions for terms ending respectively on September 14, 2007, and February 1, 2008. The assessment board\u2019s notes from Ms. Pero\u2019s interview show that her answers were assessed as ranging from good to very good. The reference checks were assessed as being very good. Ms. Carriere\u2019s answers were rated very good to excellent, and her references were also found very good.\n[37] Ms. Brown testified that after assessing these women, she concluded that they would be a right fit for the positions. She was particularly impressed by their work ethic and initiative as identified in all their reference checks. Ms. Brown pointed out that in these cleaner positions, the employees worked without supervision, so a candidate\u2019s initiative was an important asset.\n(ii) Mr. Marchand\u2019s candidacy [38] Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that prior to the closing date for the filing of applications, Mr. Marchand called her asking for confirmation that his application had been received. She advised him that he could log into the Public Service Commission\u2019s (PSC) website and view the status of his application. If he had any difficulty accessing the information, he could call her back. She did not hear from him again until March 22, 2007, three days after the deadline for applying, when he called to complain about having been required to file his application on-line. During the conversation, she verified the status of his on-line application and informed him that he had been screened out.\n[39] Ms. Barnes-Girouard explained in her testimony that because Mr. Marchand\u2019s on-line application did not describe any of his employment experience, human resources staff had screened out his application as not meeting the essential experience qualifications for the position. All that he had provided in his application was a list of his prior employers without any description of his job duties or experience.\n[40] Mr. Marchand was clearly displeased upon learning that he had been eliminated from the process. He told Ms. Barnes-Girouard that it was unfair and unacceptable, adding that he would bring the matter to the attention of his MP.\n[41] Given Mr. Marchand\u2019s reaction, Ms. Barnes-Girouard spoke to her supervisor about the conversation. Since Mr. Marchand had initially complained about the on-line process before the closing date of the selection process, the supervisor decided to allow him to file his application and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in paper form. Ms. Barnes-Girouard contacted Mr. Marchand to advise him of her supervisor\u2019s decision.\n[42] Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that there was no connection between the supervisor\u2019s decision and any intervention from the MP, as Mr. Marchand had suggested in his testimony. She recalled receiving a telephone call from an \u201combudsman\u201d who had been asked by an MP to look into Mr. Marchand\u2019s case. She added, however, that this call came well after her office had already accepted his hard-copy application. The ombudsman\u2019s involvement had no bearing on the decision to allow him to file his application in paper.\n[43] After receiving the hard-copy of Mr. Marchand\u2019s application, his candidacy was reassessed for screening purposes. The screening guide used by the assessment board indicates that Mr. Marchand had again neglected to describe his work experience in detail on the application or indicate whether he met the essential requirement of experience using various commercial cleaning equipment. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that Ms. Brown nonetheless stepped in at this point and provided the assessment board with her personal knowledge to the effect that he possessed this experience. The board therefore screened him in.\n[44] Since Mr. Marchand was screened back into the appointment process, the assessment board invited him to an interview, which took place on May 24, 2007. By this time, DND had already sent Ms. Cyr, Ms. Pero and Ms. Carriere letters offering them employment.\n[44]\n[45] Ms. Brown testified that although the other candidates who applied on the process had been interviewed only by her and Ms. Barnes-Girouard, she asked a third person to also sit in on Mr. Marchand\u2019s interview and contribute to his assessment. According to Ms. Brown, since his application had been originally screened out due to insufficient information in his application and he seemed to have concerns regarding the integrity of the appointment process, she believed that he would feel \u201cmore comfortable\u201d if a third person was added to the assessment board. Ms. Barnes-Girouard added in her testimony that due to her prior dealings with Mr. Marchand where he had complained about how the appointment process was being run, and in order to reassure him that the process was transparent and that nothing \u201cunderhanded\u201d was taking place, it was decided to add another person to the assessment board for his assessment. Ms. Moorehead confirmed the degree to which Mr. Marchand was upset with the employment process and his overall attitude in this respect. She testified that he was often \u201cbelligerent\u201d when he would visit the human resources office and seemed unwilling to listen to the information she would provide him. As a result, she felt uncomfortable in his presence and testified that whenever he would come to her office, she would make sure to have two of her colleagues keep their office doors open to monitor her meeting with him.\n[46] The three assessment board members\u2019 notes on the questionnaires that they used during Mr. Marchand\u2019s interview were filed in evidence. Each of the interviewers wrote that Mr. Marchand met all of the qualifications assessed by the questions. However, the notes from his interview differ significantly from those entered by Ms. Brown and Ms. Barnes-Girouard with respect to Ms. Cyr, Ms. Pero and Ms. Carriere. Both of the interviewers wrote \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d in the margins for most of these individuals\u2019 answers to the questions. A grading table that accompanied the questionnaire indicates that only if a person is rated good to excellent is he or she considered to have met the required qualification.\n[47] Ms. Brown testified that she would add notes in the margins whenever she found that a candidate stood out as having provided a very good or excellent response. Similarly, as appeared from the questionnaires filed in evidence of a female candidate who was found unqualified, Ms. Brown would write \u201cpoor\u201d next to questions where the candidate had clearly failed to demonstrate that she met the qualification.\n[48] Following Mr. Marchand\u2019s interview, the board conducted a reference check. He had included two reference letters with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, one of which had been signed by Ms. Brown in 1994 with respect to his work at the time as a cleaner at CFB Shilo. The second letter was from a former employer in an industry that was unrelated to building maintenance, and was dated from 2004. The person who had signed the letter had ceased working for that employer and the board was therefore unable to trace him for additional information about Mr. Marchand.\n[49] Ms. Brown and Ms. Barnes-Girouard had shared the task of contacting the references for all the candidates, depending on their respective availabilities. The checks consisted of asking a series of prepared questions and writing down the responses on a form. Ms. Barnes-Girouard contacted Mr. Marchand\u2019s three other references whose names he had provided, and reported the information back to the board. She testified that all of the references were positive, and his current manager\u2019s comments were particularly \u201cstrong\u201d. One of the other references, however, was fairly dated, relating to work that Mr. Marchand had performed 12 years earlier. The third reference came from someone who had not personally supervised Mr. Marchand\u2019s work. All of the persons contacted rated Mr. Marchand between good and very good in response to the questions asked.\n[50] Ms. Brown noted in her testimony, however, that while Mr. Marchand was working for her cleaning company between 2005 and 2006, a senior military officer responsible for the administration of some of the base\u2019s facilities informed her that an allegation of harassment had been made by one of the employees against Mr. Marchand. The incident allegedly occurred while he was cleaning the base\u2019s kitchen area. At the officer\u2019s request, Ms. Brown assigned Mr. Marchand to work elsewhere on the base while the incident was being investigated and offered him the opportunity to receive sensitivity training at her company\u2019s expense. Mr. Marchand refused the training. Although Mr. Marchand conceded in his testimony that the harassment charge was made and that he turned down the course, he denied the allegations of harassment, claiming that he merely happened to have become involved in a dispute between his wife (who was one of the kitchen staff) and the other \u201cgirls\u201d who were working there. No evidence was led as to the ultimate outcome of the investigation.\n[51] With respect to the references for Ms. Cyr, Ms. Pero and Ms. Carriere, the interviews were conducted by Ms. Brown. The persons contacted gave ratings for all three women that ranged between very good and excellent. All the information provided was recent. These ratings stood out from those of all the other candidates, including Mr. Marchand\u2019s.\n[52] After completing Mr. Marchand\u2019s assessment, the board determined that he met the essential qualifications outlined for this appointment process. Ms. Barnes-Girouard sent a letter on June 6, 2007, to inform him of this finding and that his name would be placed in a pool of qualified candidates as a result of which he could be contacted for future vacancies should they arise. This was the letter where Mr. Marchand\u2019s post office box number had been mistyped (the last two digits had been inverted). As mentioned earlier, Ms. Moorehead testified that human resources staff only realized the error when Mr. Marchand visited them in August seeking an update on his file, following which a copy of the board\u2019s initial letter was sent to him.\n[53] Mr. Marchand\u2019s name remains in the pool of qualified candidates under that appointment process for temporary full-time positions from which he could still be hired to fill vacancies.\n(iii) The second appointment process \u2013 a single permanent full-time position [54] According to Ms. Brown and Ms. Barnes-Girouard, some months after the first appointment process had been launched, management decided to staff a permanent cleaner position that was being occupied by a person who was about to retire. Since the advertisement for the first appointment process referred only to the possibility of employment in temporary full-time positions, it was decided to initiate and advertise a separate appointment process for the indeterminate position. Applications under the second process had to be received by June 20, 2007.\n[55] Management also decided, however, that any persons who had qualified under the first process would be automatically screened into the second process. They would not have to reapply. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that her staff contacted the candidates who were in the existing pool, including Mr. Marchand, and asked them if they were interested in participating in the establishment of the second pool of qualified candidates, from which the appointment to the indeterminate position would be filled. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that she spoke to Mr. Marchand and he confirmed that he wanted his candidacy to be included in the second process. Of the 12 persons who had qualified under the first process, nine (seven women and two men) agreed to be considered under the second process. Nine new applications were received in response to the second process\u2019 advertisement (seven women and two men) of which seven were assessed as qualified (five women and two men). Thus, a total pool of 19 persons (14 women and five men), including Mr. Marchand, was established of candidates who were qualified for appointment to the cleaner positions in all tenures (i.e., indeterminate and term).\n[56] On August 17, 2007, after the enlarged pool of qualified candidates had been finalized, Ms. Brown wrote an email to Ms. Barnes-Girouard and Ms. Moorehead confirming that Ms. Cyr should be selected for appointment to the indeterminate position. In the email, Ms. Brown set out the rationale for the appointment. She stated that based on the references and Ms. Brown\u2019s own \u201cdealings\u201d with her, Ms. Cyr would be the \u201cbest fit\u201d for the position, an obvious reference to the \u201cright fit\u201d principle mentioned in the jurisprudence relating to public service staffing. Ms. Brown added that the decision had also largely to do with Ms. Cyr\u2019s excellent interpersonal skills and the fact that she worked very well with all the cleaners and other peers as well as the CF members residing on the base. Ms. Brown also noted that Ms. Cyr\u2019s work ethic was excellent, that she showed tremendous initiative, had organizational skills and was able to prioritize. Ms. Brown added the she was very dependable, cooperative and extremely thorough, concluding that the candidate was \u201ca definite asset\u201d.\n[57] As a result, on August 23, 2007, Ms. Barnes-Girouard sent a letter to Ms. Cyr offering her a full-time indeterminate position as a cleaner at CFB Shilo.\n[58] To summarize, therefore, DND\u2019s explanation for what transpired regarding the staffing of the cleaner positions at CFB Shilo in 2007, referred to in Mr. Marchand\u2019s complaint, is as follows:\na) Mr. Marchand did not properly complete his on-line application for the first appointment process, leaving out any information about his work experience. He thereby failed to demonstrate that he met the essential qualifications for the position and was screened out of the process.\nb) Mr. Marchand expressed his dissatisfaction with the outcome and complained that he should have been allowed to file a hard copy of his application.\nc) DND accordingly changed its position and agreed to allow Mr. Marchand back into the process, by enabling him to file a paper version of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nd) By this time, the first employment process had run its ordinary course, the other candidates had been assessed and several appointments to term positions had been made.\ne) After Mr. Marchand\u2019s assessment was completed, he was screened into the pool of qualified candidates, from which he could still be appointed if any future opportunities arose.\nf) When the second appointment process was initiated, for the indeterminate position, Mr. Marchand was automatically placed into a pool of qualified candidates along with all the other previously qualified candidates (men and women alike).\ng) Ms. Cyr was ultimately selected for the indeterminate position because the results of her assessment were outstanding and the assessment board determined that she would be the right fit for the position, in accordance with applicable public service staffing principles.\nh) While Ms. Cyr and the other persons appointed were assessed variably from good to excellent, Mr. Marchand\u2019s ratings merely indicated that he met the criteria.\ni) Mr. Marchand\u2019s sex was not a factor in the appointments referred to in his complaint. Regarding the April 2007 appointments to the term positions, he was not even a candidate due to his incomplete application. With respect to the single indeterminate appointment, Ms. Cyr was clearly the best candidate and the right fit for the position.\n[59] I find this explanation reasonable and fully supported by the evidence. Mr. Marchand was obviously mistaken in his impressions of how the staffing of the term and indeterminate positions took place in 2007. The documents that were filed at the hearing demonstrate that DND initiated two distinct appointment processes. His candidacy was not even considered for the first series of appointments because he had been screened out due to the inadequate information he had provided on his initial on-line application. Mr. Marchand had genuine and likely legitimate concerns about having been forced at first to apply on-line. The PSC has apparently since changed the policy. Lyle Borden, a senior staffing policy officer at DND testified that people are today permitted to either file applications on-line or in hard-copy format. Regardless of the obstacles created by the on-line application procedure, however, the fact remains that Mr. Marchand\u2019s initial exclusion from the appointment process was not related to his sex, but rather his failure to include essential information in his application.\n[60] In fact, he ended up omitting this information even on his written r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which he was by exception allowed to file later on. The only reason he was able to be screened back into the process was because Ms. Brown stepped in and personally confirmed that he met the essential experience qualifications.\n[61] When the time came to appoint someone to the indeterminate position, Mr. Marchand was automatically placed into the new pool of candidates, with his consent. The person who was selected, Ms. Cyr, was an outstanding candidate when compared to the other candidates in the pool, which was composed of both women and men. Of note, Ms. Cyr was found to have excellent interpersonal skills, which helped make her the right fit for the position. Ms. Brown testified that this was an important consideration for the position since the employee would have frequent interactions with the persons residing on the base and other workers. In this respect, Ms. Cyr stood in contrast to the impression Ms. Brown would have had of Mr. Marchand. She was aware that a harassment allegation had been made against Mr. Marchand in the past and the assessment board along with the staff at the human resources office were equally mindful that he used a fairly aggressive tone in expressing his disapproval as to how the appointment process was being run. In the circumstances, it was more than reasonable to conclude that Ms. Cyr would make for more of a \u201cright fit\u201d than Mr. Marchand, particularly with respect to the attribute of good interpersonal skills.\n[62] Mr. Marchand pointed to a number of elements in the evidence to argue that DND\u2019s explanation is just a pretext for its otherwise discriminatory conduct towards him. For instance, he questioned why he was the only candidate to have a third person participate in his interview. However, the explanation provided by both Ms. Brown and Ms. Barnes-Girouard was entirely reasonable in the circumstances. Mr. Marchand had raised important objections to the requirement that he apply on-line, which he claimed impacted unfairly on persons like him who had limited computer skills. He questioned the legitimacy of the appointment process and had openly expressed his disapproval. He threatened to call his MP and spoke with a tone that prompted Ms. Moorehead to take certain security measures when he visited her office. Given these facts, the assessment board\u2019s opting to add a third party to help provide Mr. Marchand with some additional confidence in the process\u2019 transparency was understandable.\n[63] In addition, Mr. Marchand suggested that Ms. Brown appointed Ms. Cyr and the other women because they are her friends. Yet, he mentioned that he had considered himself to be a friend of Ms. Brown\u2019s as well. It is to be expected that among what appears to be a relatively modestly sized workforce of cleaners at the base, some friendships would develop. Nonetheless, even if Ms. Brown had exhibited any personal favouritism towards Ms. Cyr or the other selected candidates, it does not contribute to a finding that sex was a factor in the decision to appoint them.\n[64] Mr. Marchand had also questioned in his evidence why Ms. Carriere was hired given that she does not hold a driver\u2019s licence. He may not have been aware, however, that the statement of merit criteria for the term positions had been modified two weeks after the original job posting. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that the possession of a driver\u2019s licence was converted from an essential condition of employment to an operational requirement, which meant that the necessity to have a licence would depend on the requirements of the particular position being staffed. Ms. Barnes-Girouard testified that this change was not made to favour a specific person. Management had informed her that the cleaning jobs at the base did not all require a driver\u2019s licence. Ms. Brown confirmed in her testimony that in recent years, cleaners have been assigned to work at fewer locations on the base. As a result, the ability to drive from one location to another is no longer necessary to perform the job. Ms. Barnes-Girouard stated that the requirement was therefore removed as an essential qualification because by maintaining it, potential candidates without a licence may have \u201cself-screened\u201d themselves out of the process and decided not to bother applying. She added that amending advertisements for this type of reason is not an uncommon occurrence in a staffing process, a point that was reiterated by Mr. Borden in his testimony. Consequently, since possessing a licence ceased being an essential qualification, Ms. Carriere was not precluded from being qualified for the position.\n[65] Finally, it should also be mentioned that Mr. Marchand raised some questions regarding DND\u2019s obligations to promote employment equity within its workforce. The job advertisements for the cleaning positions stated that the appointments may be limited to the selection of members from designated employment equity groups (Aboriginal persons, persons in a visible minority group, persons with disabilities, and women). In the paper version of his application, Mr. Marchand had identified himself as a member of a designated group (disabled person). His human rights complaint did not, however, allege discrimination on the basis of disability.\n[66] Mr. Borden testified that all job postings at DND contain a similar employment equity clause and that, as in the present instance, it is usually not included as one of the essential merit criteria for the appointment process. As a result, it is entirely within a hiring manager\u2019s discretion whether or not to consider this factor when deciding whom to appoint. Managers will typically take into account the organization\u2019s human resources, business, and employment equity plans, and the existence of any gap between the proportion of individuals from a designated group employed within a given workforce and the corresponding proportion of qualified individuals from the group found in the job market outside the federal public service. In 2007, all four of the abovementioned designated groups were underrepresented in the GS-BUS-2 category at DND for the Manitoba region (excluding Winnipeg). By 2009, the figures show that persons with disabilities were no longer underrepresented and were in fact, overrepresented. Mr. Borden noted, however, that even where a gap exists, a manager is entitled to place more emphasis on the skills that the organization is seeking in order to ensure that the \u201cright fit\u201d candidate is selected, than on employment equity considerations.\n[67] DND was thus not required to apply the employment equity criteria in deciding who would be the right fit for the appointments. In any event, had it done so, it is highly speculative to presume that Mr. Marchand would have been appointed, as all four designated groups (not just persons with disabilities) were under-represented in 2007, and there still remained the outstanding questions regarding his interpersonal skills relative to the other candidates, like Ms. Cyr. Moreover, he has not demonstrated how the decision not to limit the staffing of the positions to members of the designated employment equity groups would constitute proof of discrimination against him on the ground of sex, which is the basis of his complaint.\nIV. Conclusion [68] For all the above reasons, I find that Mr. Marchand\u2019s sex was not a factor in DND\u2019s decision not to appoint him to one of the term and indeterminate positions. DND has provided a complete and reasonable explanation for the circumstances that gave rise to the women\u2019s appointments to the cleaner positions and Mr. Marchand has not established that the explanation is in fact just a pretext for an otherwise discriminatory practice.\n[69] The complaint has therefore not been substantiated and is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

DECISION SUMMARY\nIndian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC, the Crown, the respondent) provides funding to First Nations service providers who provide child welfare services (child welfare) to First Nations children residing on reserves. The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (the Society or complainant) and the Assembly of First Nations (AFN or complainant) assert that INAC does more than fund. They say INAC provides child welfare directly or indirectly to these children. They say the funding is inadequate when compared to the funding that provinces provide to other children residing off reserve. They say this funding differentiates adversely against these First Nations children contrary to section 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA or Act).\nThe Crown brings a motion for a ruling that questions arising out of the complaint are not within the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal). It argues principally that funding \/ transfer payments do not constitute the provision of \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of the CHRA, and that INAC\u2019s funding cannot as a matter of law be compared to provincial funding. It says that these two questions may be dealt with now and without a full hearing wherein witnesses would testify and more evidence would be tendered.\nThe CHRA does not require that the Tribunal hold a hearing with witnesses in every case. The onus is on the Crown in this motion to demonstrate that this is the case here. The Tribunal must be satisfied that the parties have had a full and ample opportunity to be heard and to present their evidence. The Tribunal will only entertain a motion to dismiss a complaint wherein more evidence could not conceivably be of any assistance: where the Crown has shown that the facts are clear, complete and uncontroverted, or where the Crown has shown that the issues involve pure questions of law. If the Crown meets this onus, the Tribunal may decide the substantive questions in a motion forum.\nThere are two principle questions that the Crown wishes me to answer in this motion:\ni. Is INAC\u2019s funding program a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5(b) of the Act?\nii. Can two different service providers be compared to each other to find adverse differentiation, or for that matter, is a comparison even required?\nOn the services question, the Crown has not met its onus of demonstrating that the facts are clear, complete and uncontroverted. I cannot decide the question. On the comparator question, the Crown has met its onus. It has satisfied me that the \u201ccomparator\u201d question is a pure question of law. I can decide this question on the basis of the materials filed in this motion. I find that the CHRA does require a comparison to be made, but not the one proposed by the complainants. Two different service providers cannot be compared to each other. Accordingly, even if I were to find that INAC is a service provider as asserted by the complainants, the CHRA does not allow INAC as a service provider to be compared to the provinces as service providers. The complaint could not succeed, even if a further hearing were held on the services question. Accordingly the complaint must be dismissed. A summary of my reasons follow.\nA. Services\nThe Crown\u2019s motion has resulted in the following evidence being placed before me. In this case, the Crown, and the complainants, and two interveners, Chiefs of Ontario (The Ont. Chiefs) and Amnesty International (Amnesty), have filed the documents and the submissions as outlined in Appendix \u201cA\u201d. I have vetted the materials filed relevant to this motion, more than 10,000 pages. Ironically, this volume of materials appears to be grossly insufficient to address the scope and breadth of this complaint.\nINAC\u2019s funding is complex. INAC\u2019s funding supports 108 First Nations child welfare service providers to deliver child welfare to approximately 160,000 children and youth in approximately 447 of 663 First Nations. There may be at least 50 to 60 funding agreements and memoranda relating to Directive 20-1 alone that are involved (not yet filed). There are provincial and territorial differences in funding schemes and differences in service models: e.g. self-managed reserves versus other First Nations reserves. What are the terms and conditions of these various funding agreements? What are the terms and conditions of each of the various memoranda of understanding? Does INAC control the type of child welfare delivered through any or each of the funding terms and conditions? Do these terms and conditions define the content of child welfare? As well, do INAC\u2019s auditing measures go beyond simply ensuring accountability of funds? Do INAC\u2019s auditing measures in fact constitute an action by INAC demonstrating that INAC is delivering child welfare? Again, even if the transfer payments are on the whole only transfer payments, is there a discrete subset of the program administration wherein INAC can be said to control the content of child welfare? The Crown has not met its onus. The material facts are not clear, complete and uncontroverted. This is due in part to the scope and breadth of this complaint that exceeds any complaint filed with the Tribunal to date. In this case, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) did not conduct an investigation of the relevant facts before referring the complaint to the Tribunal for a hearing. Rather, it wrote that the \u201cmain arguments being adduced are legal and not factual in nature and are not settled in law\u201d.\nIrrespective of the Commission\u2019s referral decision, it is incumbent on the Tribunal to help the parties to diligently narrow the broad and complex factual issues, while identifying and determining any clear legal issues that arise in this complaint. As one means of achieving this objective, I offered the parties a Tribunal Member to work with them in process mediation to narrow the factual and legal issues. The parties did not reach agreement on material facts. The parties chose not to file with the Tribunal to date a consolidated Agreed Statement of Facts. Given the expanse of the complaint, and a lack of reasonable definition to its parameters, I cannot decide the services issue on the evidence filed.\nB. Comparator\nHowever, on the evidence and submissions filed, I can decide the comparator issue. I can determine whether the allegation of adverse differentiation is legally deficient. Section 5(b) of the CHRA states that a service provider may not adversely differentiate against an individual in providing services customarily available to the public. Whether these words in the CHRA require a comparison, and if so, the manner of comparison, are pure questions of law. The Crown has met its onus of demonstrating that this is a pure question of law that may be decided now. The parties have had full and ample opportunity to be heard on this question of law. There is no further evidence that the complainants can file that will further their position.\nI decide as follows: In order to find that adverse differentiation exists, one has to compare the experience of the alleged victims with that of someone else receiving those same services from the same provider. How else can one experience adverse differentiation? These words of the CHRA must be accorded their clear meaning as intended by Parliament. These words are unique to the CHRA. These words have been decided by the Federal Court of Appeal as requiring a comparative analysis in the case of Singh v. Canada (Department of External Affairs), [1989] 1 F.C. 430 (F.C.A.) [Singh]. Further, the complaint itself seeks a comparison. The heart of the complaint involves comparing INAC\u2019s funding to provincial funding.\nRegarding the issue of choice of comparator, the parties agree that INAC does not fund or regulate child welfare for off-reserve children. The provision of child welfare to off reserve children is entirely a provincial matter falling within section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (U.K.), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 5. Can federal government funding be compared to provincial government funding to find adverse differentiation as set out in section 5(b) of the Act? The answer is no.\nThe Act does not allow a comparison to be made between two different service providers with two different service recipients. Federal funding goes to on-reserve First Nations children for child welfare. Provincial funding goes to all children who live off-reserve. These constitute separate and distinct service providers with separate service recipients. The two cannot be compared.\nLet us look at how the Act works. As an example, the Act allows an Aboriginal person who receives lesser service from a government to file a complaint if a non-Aboriginal person receives better service from the same government. However, the Act does not allow an Aboriginal person, or any other person, to claim differential treatment if another person receives better service from a different government.\nWere it otherwise, the far-reaching impact of the proposed reasoning would also extend to employment. As another example, the Act allows an Aboriginal employee who receives different treatment from an employer to file a complaint if a non-Aboriginal employee receives better treatment from the same employer. However, the Act does not allow an Aboriginal employee, or any other employee, to claim differential treatment if another employee receives better treatment from a different employer.\nIn addition, such reasoning would extend to allow a member of one First Nation to argue that her First Nation adversely differentiated against her by comparing the services she received with those offered by another First Nation to another First Nation member.\nThere would be no limit to the comparisons that could be made. Further, in this case, the comparison sought to be made is between constitutionally independent jurisdictions: the federal government and the provincial \/ territorial governments.\nOn this issue, the parties have had a full and ample opportunity to file affidavits, cross-examine on affidavits, appear before the Tribunal with their lawyers, and submit arguments. Further, the parties were granted an opportunity to file submissions until August 23, 2010 and December 23, 2010 (see Appendix \u201cA\u201d) respectively, with respect to three new decisions. These were New Brunswick Human Rights Commission v. Province of New Brunswick (Department of Social Development), 2010 NBCA 40 [NBHRC v. PNB] released on June 3, 2010, and two decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada being NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union, 2010 SCC 45 [NIL\/TU,O], and Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v. Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, 2010 SCC 46 [Native Child and Family Services of Toronto] rendered together on November 4, 2010. They were also granted the opportunity to file submissions with respect to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples GA Res. 61\/295 (Annex), UN GAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No. 49, Vol. III, UN Doc. A\/61\/49 (2008) 15 (UNDRIP). No further evidence in a further hearing with witnesses can make this legal issue any clearer. Indeed, a further hearing may result in the devotion of time and resources to a protracted and lengthy fact finding exercise that is irrelevant to the legal flaw identified. Any further hearing would be moot. The complaint cannot succeed on this legal point.\nCultural Considerations \u2013 Canada\u2019s First Nations People \u2013 Oral Tradition\nThe hearing of this motion opened with an Algonquin prayer recited by Elder Bertha Commanda. In deciding this motion, I am acutely aware of the need to be cognizant and respectful of the cultural concerns of Canada\u2019s First Nations people. The AFN, the Society and the Commission make vigorous submissions to move towards both a hearing and a determination that the CHRA allows a finding of adverse differential treatment by comparing the actions of one race based service provider or funder, in this case, INAC, to that of the provinces. I acknowledge the importance of the oral tradition to the First Nations people. However, had this complaint proceeded to a hearing with witnesses, which would be fruitless, the hearing would have been complex and lengthy, potentially stretching into years of protracted litigation. Such a hearing would have been mired with the requisite burden of emotional and legal costs for all parties and the witnesses. In fact, the Tribunal has been criticized by the Federal Court of Appeal for mismanaging a pay equity hearing that spanned more than ten years before the Tribunal, and is still in litigation (Public Service Alliance of Canada v Canada Post Corporation, 2010 FCA 56 at para. 145 [Canada Post] (leave to appeal to SCC granted Docket No. 33668, 33669, 33670). Proceeding to a viva voce hearing on a complaint that cannot succeed on a legal basis does not serve the parties or the justice system. This is not access to justice. This is contrary to access to justice.\nIt is important to understand that the name of the CHRA is misleading. Even though its name imports a notion that the CHRA and the Tribunal may cure a range of human rights violations, the Tribunal\u2019s mandate is restricted to remedying discrimination on the legislated grounds in legislated areas such as employment, services, and residential accommodation, to name a few. Thus, Canada\u2019s First Nations people and their fellow Canadians are restricted from obtaining broader human rights remedies that do not involve a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act. Unless the subject matter of the complaint falls within a section of the anti-discrimination statute, it cannot succeed.\nFinally, I am mindful of the constitutional quagmire that Canada\u2019s First Nations people find themselves in. However, the legal tools for contesting allegedly inequitable funding do not lie in s. 5(b) of the CHRA as it is currently framed. The Tribunal is not a court seized with a constitutional challenge. It does not have the ability to redefine the meaning of adverse differentiation to suit the circumstances. The Tribunal must reside with integrity within the four corners of the statute that creates it. The claims may well be cognizable through the initialization of other legal processes, or in political action and \/ or ongoing federal and provincial consultations, or may ultimately even require statutory amendments. The laudable arguments of the complainant group may be well received by those appropriately charged with hearing them.\nII. WHAT IS THIS COMPLAINT ABOUT? The Society and the AFN assert that thousands of First Nations children living on Canadian reserves do not receive adequate funding of child welfare. Child welfare for children residing off reserve is funded by provinces or territories. The complainants seek that INAC be required by law to fund child welfare to similar levels as provinces and territories. They allege that a First Nations child residing on a reserve receives less child welfare and protection services than another Canadian child, possibly living across the highway, not on reserve. They allege that the provinces fund child welfare to a significantly greater extent than INAC does and that INAC\u2019s underfunding results in a systemic discriminatory impact upon the lives of Aboriginal children residing on reserves. They allege that this underfunding results in culturally inappropriate delivery of such services contrary to the purposes of the funding program. They seek that the Tribunal order INAC to increase funding by 109 million dollars per year to address existing funding shortfalls.\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that a funding formula, Directive 20-1, Chapter 5 (Directive 20-1) contravenes s. 5 of the Act in that registered First Nations children and families resident on reserve are provided with inequitable levels of child welfare because of their race and national, ethnic origin as compared to non-Aboriginal and other children residing off reserve. The particulars \/ pleadings filed by the complainant group broaden the discrimination allegation to include the INAC First Nations Child and Family Services Program (FNCFS Program), that includes both Directive 20-1 and the Enhanced Prevention-Focused Approach funding (EPFA), and the funding INAC provides in Ontario pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians known as the 1965 Welfare Agreement (1965 Agt.).\nIII. WHAT IS THIS MOTION ABOUT?\nA. Crown Says Tribunal has no Jurisdiction to Hear the Complaint\nThe respondent brings a motion for an order to dismiss this complaint for lack of jurisdiction alleging that the complaint does not come within the provisions of section 5(b) of the CHRA. The other parties say that the motion is unfounded and premature and that the matter should proceed immediately to a full hearing on the merits.\nB. What are the Issues in this Motion?\ni. Does the Act require the Tribunal to hold a viva voce hearing inquiry in every case?\nii. If not, can the Tribunal decide the following issues in this motion:\na. Is INAC providing a service for the purposes of s. 5(b) of the Act? Is funding justiciable?\nb. Does adverse differentiation within the meaning of s. 5(b) of the Act require a comparator group? Alternatively, does it allow a comparison between two service providers?\nIV. CAN THE TRIBUNAL DECIDE THE ISSUES IN THIS MOTION BASED ON THE MATERIALS FILED WITHOUT A VIVA VOCE HEARING?\nThe essence of this motion involves whether or not the complainants should be able to proceed to a viva voce hearing or whether this Tribunal may decide the complaint now, based on the materials before it without a viva voce hearing? The parties have widely diverging views on the Tribunal\u2019s authority to decide the issues raised in the motion at this stage.\nA. Summary of the Positions of the Parties\nThe Crown\nThe Crown\u2019s position appears somewhat multi-faceted. On one hand, the Crown in some instances characterizes its motion as being \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in nature, and submits that the Tribunal may determine the limits of its own jurisdiction at any time during the course of the inquiry. Whereas it has been judicially recognized that the Tribunal has the authority to dismiss a complaint without a viva voce hearing for abuse of process, the Crown asserts that bringing a complaint outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is an abuse of process and thus susceptible to summary dismissal. However, at other points in its representations, the Crown characterizes its motion as concerning matters going directly to the \u201cmerits\u201d of the complaint. In this last regard the Crown argues that the burden is on the complainants to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that they have shown a prima facie case of discrimination, and that this burden remains with the complainants throughout the inquiry. Moreover, the Crown also asserts that the matters raised in its motion deal with questions of law, which the Tribunal may decide in the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry. The Crown rejects the use of legal tests developed from rules of civil procedure, in particular, the \u201cplain and obvious test\u201d, which the civil Courts apply when hearing motions to strike a claim that allegedly discloses no reasonable cause of action.\nThe Commission\nThe Commission\u2019s position is also multifaceted. First, the Commission alleges that the Tribunal may only dismiss a complaint after a hearing on the merits, unless it can be demonstrated that to pursue the inquiry would be an abuse of process. Even in the context of abuse of process, the power of summary dismissal must only be exercised with a great deal of caution, and only in the clearest of cases. The threshold to prove abuse of process is extremely high\u2014the proceedings must be unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice. Second, the Commission asserts that the issue before the Tribunal in regards to the motion is whether it is \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the complainants and Commission\u2019s pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action\u2014or in CHRA terms\u2014whether the respondent has demonstrated that the complaint is devoid of any merit. To strike the complaint, the Tribunal must find that, assuming all the facts alleged to be true and complete by means of affidavits, there is no chance that the complaint will succeed. Moreover, a claim should not be struck if it involves a serious question of law or questions of general importance, or if additional facts are required before the complainants\u2019 rights can be decided on the merits.\nThe Society\nIn the Society\u2019s view, the Crown must establish that it is \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the complaint should be dismissed without a viva voce hearing and in the absence of a complete evidentiary record, and contrary to a direction of the Federal Court pertaining to judicial review of the Commission\u2019s referral decision. The Society notes that the Tribunal has been loath to grant motions to dismiss, given the language of the CHRA, and the significance and remedial objectives of human rights legislation. Two particular legislative features militating against summary dismissal are: (i) the screening provisions enabling the Commission to dispose of a complaint without a Tribunal inquiry; and, (ii) the Tribunal\u2019s duty, set out in s. 50(1) of the Act, to give all parties a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make arguments on the matters raised in the complaint. While Tribunal jurisprudence has recognized an authority to dismiss a complaint by motion in circumstances where the issues in the complaint have been heard in another forum, or where there is a clear breach of natural justice, the Society argues that such circumstances are not present in the case at hand. However, the Society also asserts that motions for preliminary dismissal should not be granted where the disposition of the case on the merits calls for an assessment and finding of fact, or where the claim raises a difficult and important point of law. Finally, in the Society\u2019s view, the current case is not a case that could ever be dismissed on a preliminary basis. It involves a significant personal interest for thousands of children. It raises difficult and important issues of law previously unaddressed. It has wide ranging precedential impact, and is fact driven where the facts are myriad and complex, and where the facts will inform the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis.\nThe Ont. Chiefs\nThe Ont. Chiefs submit that the Crown\u2019s motion is premature, and inappropriate given the Federal Court\u2019s refusal to judicially review the Commission\u2019s referral of the case for inquiry. The Ont. Chiefs assert that unless it is clear and plain that the complaint has absolutely no merit, the Crown\u2019s motion must be dismissed. The Crown must establish that it is plain and obvious that the complaint will inevitably fail even after a full record is laid before the Tribunal. The Ont. Chiefs argue that the jurisdictional and other issues raised by the Crown should be decided on a full body of evidence, as opposed to the relatively threadbare record attached to the current motion. A full record before the Tribunal is crucial, given the enormous stakes of the motion, namely determination of whether a program with a funding component falls within s. 5 of the CHRA. A negative finding on this point would effectively exempt from CHRA review the bulk of federal programming in relation to First Nations. Making a preliminary decision could also prejudice the parties by delaying a hearing on the merits, for if the case is terminated on preliminary grounds and this ruling is overturned by the superior courts, the parties will be obliged to start their case several years in the future (even though they are ready to proceed on the merits now). By the time the preliminary dismissal is remitted to the Tribunal, key witnesses may no longer be available. Judicial economy militates against the fragmentation of the proceeding in this way.\nB. The CHRA Does Not Require a Viva Voce Hearing in Every Case\nMaterial Facts are Clear and Uncontroverted or Questions of Pure Law\nThe Tribunal is a creature of statute and exists as part of a larger legislative scheme for identifying and remedying discrimination. Accordingly, the question as to the appropriateness of the motion for summary dismissal requires an examination of the Act. By examining all relevant aspects of the Tribunal\u2019s enabling statute, one may determine precisely what forms of case disposition Parliament intended the Tribunal to carry out. Any ambiguities in the enabling legislation must be interpreted in a manner that furthers, rather than frustrates the objectives of the CHRA (Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association, 2003 SCC 36 at para. 42 [Bell Canada]).\nThe Tribunal is an independent body established by the Act to hold inquiries into complaints referred to it by the Commission. The Act provides that the Tribunal may hold two types of inquiries, one with a viva voce hearing and one without. Under s. 50(1) of the Act, the assigned Member shall inquire into the complaint and \u201cshall\u201d give all parties a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d, in person, or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. Section 50(3) of the CHRA authorizes the Tribunal Member presiding over a hearing of the inquiry to summon witnesses, compel them to give evidence and produce such documents and things as are necessary, administer oaths, receive such evidence and other information, on oath, by affidavit, or otherwise that the Member sees fit, and decide procedural and evidentiary questions. In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at para. 17 [Cremasco], aff\u2019d in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363, the Federal Court made clear that the inquiry is distinct from the \u201chearing\u201d and is not coextensive with the term \u201chearing\u201d, as that word is used in s. 50(3) of the Act. In Cremasco, supra, the Federal Court held that Parliament\u2019s use of the term \"inquiry\" in subsection 50(1) and the term \"hearing\" in subsection 50(3) of the CHRA clearly indicates that the referral of a matter to the Tribunal does not necessarily have to result in a hearing in every case. Thus, while dismissal of the complaint requires an inquiry, it does not \u201cnecessarily\u201d require a hearing.\nFurther to s. 48.9(2) of the Act the Tribunal shall proceed as informally and expeditiously as possible. As the Court said in Cremasco, supra, at para. 18, \u201cit is hard to fathom a reason why it would be in anyone's interest to have the Tribunal hold a hearing in cases where it considers that such a hearing would amount to an abuse of its process.\u201d In such endeavours, of particular relevance to the current issue is the inference to be drawn from s. 53(1) of the Act, namely, that the Tribunal can only dismiss a complaint \u201c\u2026[a]t the conclusion of an inquiry\u201d. [emphasis added]\nThe repeated use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in these provisions strongly suggests the imposition of two mandatory duties on the Tribunal: on one hand, it must conduct its process as informally and expeditiously as natural justice will permit. On the other hand, it must ensure that in every inquiry the Tribunal accords a full and ample opportunity for the parties to participate as described. In this aspect, the Act is exceptional in codifying the common law duty of adherence to the principles of natural justice as well as the common law principles that administrative tribunals operate informally and expeditiously and neatly juxtaposes them as countervailing duties in s. 48.9(1) of the Act. It is for the Tribunal to find the judicial fulcrum in each case.\nThe instruction in s. 48.9(2) of the CHRA to proceed with informality and expedition is subject to two important limits: the principles of natural justice and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, May 3rd, 2004 (Rules of Procedure).\nBut when can dismissal occur in the absence of a viva voce hearing? Here again, the Cremasco decision, supra, is instructive. In Cremasco, supra, the Court held that the Tribunal can dismiss a case without holding a hearing where holding a hearing would amount to an abuse of process. In the Cremasco case, supra, the particular form of abuse of process at issue was the re-litigation of previously decided questions, which is sanctioned by the doctrine of res judicata, or issue estoppel. There are other forms of abuse of process, but the question which immediately arises is, does Cremasco, supra, detail the only conceivable situation where the Tribunal can dismiss the complaint without a hearing? I do not believe so. I believe that the logic of the Cremasco decision, supra, based as it is on the legislative scheme of the CHRA, can be extended to other contexts, so long as no complaint is dismissed before the conclusion of an inquiry. And as has been seen above, the fundamental procedural requirement in any inquiry is the granting to parties of a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present evidence and make representations (as per s. 50(1) of the Act). But what this opportunity actually entails will depend on the nature of the specific case and the reasons for which dismissal is being sought.\nThus when faced with a request to dismiss the case in the context of a motion inquiry, all the bases for the motion must be closely scrutinized to ensure that each one lends themselves to adjudication\u2014in motion format\u2014in compliance with s. 50(1) of the Act.\nThe consequence of this analysis is that the moving party in a pre-hearing motion to dismiss bears a double onus:\n(1) The \u201cprocedural\u201d onus of convincing the Tribunal that the issues raised can be properly adjudicated in the context of a motion (as opposed to a viva voce hearing) and in full compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s statutory obligation to provide all parties a full and ample opportunity to be heard.\n(2) The \u201csubstantive\u201d onus of convincing the Tribunal that the reasons for dismissal are valid.\nGiven the wording of the Act and the objectives of the legislative scheme (in particular, the promotion of equal opportunity) it is appropriate that the party seeking summary disposition of the complaint justify why summary proceedings are appropriate. In practical terms, assuming that the Tribunal has safeguarded the rights of the parties for a full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry and make representations, the moving party must satisfy the Tribunal that the motion forum is one in which the rights of all parties to present evidence is safeguarded; i.e. that no further evidence can be of assistance in making the determination at hand.\nThis may occur in two instances: a) where the moving party has demonstrated that the material facts in the relevant case are clear and are not in dispute and\/or b) the issues raised involve only questions of pure law. Thus, additional evidence is of no assistance.\nC. Does Using a Motion Forum to Decide a Complaint Based on Uncontroverted Facts or a Legal Issue Comply with Natural Justice?\nDoes the Motion Forum in this Case Comply with Natural Justice?\nParties have the right to a fair hearing (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at para. 22 and 28 [Baker]; see also Uniboard Surfaces Inc. v. Kronotex Fussboden GmbH and Co. KG, 2006 FCA 398 at para. 26 [Uniboard]).\nThe factors affecting the content of the duty of fairness were discussed by the Supreme Court in Baker, supra, at paras. 22-27, and include the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute, the importance of the decision to the individuals affected, the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision, and the choices of procedure made by the agency itself, particularly when it has expertise and the statute gives it procedural discretion. Each of these five factors are not to be routinely applied to a given process but must be adapted to the particular context (Uniboard, supra). A case by case analysis is required to meet the requirements of procedural fairness (Ha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FCA 49 [Ha]).\ni. Consider the Nature of the Decision Being Made and the Process \u2013 How Judicial is it?\nPertaining to the administrative process, I observe that the Tribunal\u2019s administrative process is very close to the judicial process, and has been characterized as very Court-like as its hearings have \u201c...much the same structure as a formal trial before a Court\u201d (see Bell Canada, supra, at para. 23). However, the Courts do not utilize the \u201ctrial model\u201d for the disposition of every case (see Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106, Rule 210 (motion for default judgment); Rule 213 (motion for summary judgment or summary trial); Rule 220 (preliminary determination of question of law or admissibility); Rule 221 (motion to strike out pleading); Part 5 (Applications)). Thus any analogy drawn between Tribunal adjudication and \u201cjudicial decision-making\u201d should reflect the fact that a good part of \u201cjudicial decision-making\u201d involves final \u2013 or potentially final\u2014disposition of cases outside of the \u201ctrial model\u201d.\nii. Consider the Statutory Scheme and the Terms of the Statute \u2013 How Final is the Decision?\nThe nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates need to be examined in view of the degree of finality of the decision in question. While it is true that a Tribunal decision dismissing a complaint under the CHRA is not subject to appeal, it is not protected by a privative clause either, and Tribunal decisions are reviewable without leave, by the Federal Court, followed by an appeal as of right to the Federal Court of Appeal (Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at paras. 52, 64, 123, 143; Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, ss.18, 27, 28). I note that in Ha, supra, the Court held that judicial review cannot be equated to full appeal rights because the reviewing judge\u2019s authority may be limited with respect to the substantive issues of the case. This is not to say that the availability of judicial review has no relevance whatsoever, especially as in this case here where there is no privative clause, no leave is required and the judicial review proceeds directly to the Federal Court. Ha, supra, is a case in point: it is grounded in the examination of the particular statutory scheme of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 2001, c. 27, s. 72 wherein leave is required for judicial review.\niii. Consider the Importance of the Decision to the Individual or Individuals Affected\nIn considering the importance of the decision to the affected individuals, the Supreme Court directed that \"[t]he more important the decision is to the lives of those affected and the greater its impact on that person or those persons, the more stringent the procedural protections that will be mandated\" (Baker, supra, at para. 25). Yet, all decisions are equally important for those who are affected by them and thus there is a need to examine how the decision may actually affect the persons concerned. I believe that the cultural and constitutional considerations that resonate throughout this case militate in favour of significant procedural fairness. I am also fastidiously conscious of the quasi-constitutional nature of human rights litigation juxtaposed against the uniqueness of this case, the significant cultural, social and political ramifications of the decision for First Nations, as well as the oral tradition history of First Nations people that may be incongruous with the use of affidavit evidence that forms the basis of the motion.\nIn the same vein, I observe that the Crown\u2019s affiant, Ms. Johnston deposed that INAC has increased funding from 193 million in 1996 to 523 million in 2008-2009 under the EPFA available in 5 provinces, and has tripled funding in this time period. The complainant group does not appear to contest these figures. Rather, it argues that this funding increase is insufficient, funding remains inadequate, and further that some provinces are seeking to access EPFA but are unable to do so due to INAC\u2019s failure to make it available to them.\niv. Consider the Legitimate Expectations of the Parties \u2013 Did they Reasonably Expect a Viva Voce Hearing?\nThe legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision may also determine what procedures the duty of fairness requires in given circumstances. This factor raises the question of whether the complainant group in this motion had a reasonable expectation that the merits of the case would be dealt with exclusively by means of a viva voce \u201ctrial-type\u201d hearing. Of significant relevance to this issue are the Tribunal\u2019s informal Rules of Procedure, of which Rule 3 provides a broad opportunity for the bringing of motions, the presentation of evidence in support thereof, and in answer thereto, and flexibility in the options for disposition. The Rules of Procedure may not have the status of statutory instruments, but that does not diminish their ability to assist parties and members of the public to predict how the Tribunal may likely proceed (see Thamotharem v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 198 at paras. 55-56 [Thamotharem]). Another consideration affecting the legitimate expectations of the parties in this case would be the absence of any firm promises made to them that all substantive matters would be dealt with in a formal hearing under s. 50(3) of the Act.\nThe former Chairperson\u2019s approach to case management of this case may have been less structured, but he was not irrevocably seized with the case for purposes of s. 48.2(2) of the CHRA. The parties would have known as of September 2009 that his term was due to expire imminently. Indeed, he had been pro tempore since January 1, 2009 (P.C. 2008-1886, C. Gaz. 2009.I.151.). Further, while he outlined a schedule for a viva voce hearing of this complaint, his schedule was not rigorously adhered to under his tenure. In a December 2009 case management conference, I asked the parties if they wished to make submissions regarding how I should exercise any discretion I may have had to extend the former Chairperson\u2019s tenure for the purposes of this inquiry. The parties chose not to avail themselves of this opportunity.\nSince early November of 2009, through case management discussions, the parties have been aware that there was a serious possibility that the \u201ctrial model\u201d would not be dogmatically adhered to in this case. As well, the Tribunal offered the parties new and innovative ways to work towards agreement concerning issues, facts and the presentation of evidence in dispute through the assignment of another Tribunal Member to act as a process mediator in January 2010. Finally, the complainant group had been aware of the Crown\u2019s intention to address these issues in this motion as threshold issues through the Crown\u2019s filing in November 2008 of a judicial review application of the Commission\u2019s referral decision. I will address the orders of Prothonotary Aronovitch and the appeal decision in respect of those orders below in another context (which were only rendered on November 24, 2009 and March 30, 2010 respectively). All in all, abbreviation of the process, if appropriate, could have been reasonably anticipated. At the very least, it was not unforeseeable.\nv. Consider the Choice of Procedure Made by the Tribunal \u2013 Does the Act Give the Chairperson Discretion and does that Person have the Expertise to Make that Decision?\nFinally, one must consider the choices of procedure made by the Tribunal itself, particularly when the Act leaves to the Tribunal the ability to choose its own procedures, and further where the Tribunal has an expertise in determining what procedures are appropriate in the circumstances. Regarding the latter, Members of the Tribunal are appointed for their expertise, experience and sensitivity to human rights (CHRA, s. 48.1(2)). Moreover, where a case proceeds to a viva voce hearing it is noteworthy that Parliament has expressly entrusted the Members with the authority to decide any procedural question arising therein (CHRA, s. 50(3)(e)). Regarding the former, I have already discussed the issues above. Parliament has granted the Tribunal Chairperson with a broad discretion, both to establish a procedural framework for Tribunal inquiries (CHRA, s. 48.9(2)) and to otherwise define procedural aspects of the inquiry (CHRA, s. 49(2), (3)). In the current case, entertaining the Crown\u2019s motion exemplifies the access to justice policy adopted by the Tribunal, in pursuit of the twin goals of decreased costs (legal and emotionally restorative) for parties, and speedier\u2014though nonetheless expert and fair\u2014disposition of cases.\nConclusion \u2013 Hearing the Crown\u2019s Arguments in This Motion Meets Natural Justice\nA summary of the five Baker, supra, factors leads to the conclusion that while the duty of fairness (and consequently the principles of natural justice) requires much more than an administrative review or \u201cpaper hearing\u201d of the issues at stake, the procedural protections need not be identical to those existing in a formal trial. In the current case, the parties were able to file documentary evidence, affidavit evidence, as well as the transcribed cross-examinations of the affiants, and were granted a full opportunity to attend before the Tribunal to make oral arguments. The Tribunal record on this motion alone consists of more than 10,000 pages. Additional opportunities were sought and granted to present additional legal authorities and make submissions thereon as mentioned above. From the stand point of s. 48.9 (1) of the Act, I believe that the relatively informal and expeditious summary proceeding opted for by the Crown in this case does not offend the rules of natural justice. All parties have been accorded procedural fairness with regards to the presentation of the Crown\u2019s motion for dismissal.\nFurther, the disposition of certain issues through a motion is consistent with the longstanding mission of administrative tribunals, including this Tribunal, of continuously striving for the expeditious, fair and well-informed resolution of legal disputes (Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance Canada [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941; Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570).\nIn response to the Ont. Chiefs\u2019 concerns about the potential for fragmentation of the hearing, cases involving clear legal issues are relatively rare, and further, the argument presupposes that the Tribunal\u2019s determination will be set aside in subsequent judicial proceedings. The benefits of clear and early determination of pivotal issues outweigh such speculative risks.\nOn the whole, hearing the Crown`s motion in the present case facilitates, rather than impedes access to justice. It allows the parties to consider where and how to best expend their resources and whether for example, a constitutional challenge or other avenues, may constitute a more appropriate means to address their concerns. It prevents the inflation of unrealistic expectations. It aims to address fundamental objections appropriately prior to parties dedicating significant resources to viva voce hearings, which may themselves run for years together. Indeed, the Federal Court of Appeal has chastised this Tribunal for mismanagement of the hearing process in allowing a complex case to consume exceptional amounts of time and resources (Canada Post, supra). In that case, the Applications Judge had noted \u201ca legal hearing without discipline and timelines both delays and denies justice\u201d (Canada Post, supra, at para. 145). In my view, given the expansive nature of the present complaint, it did and does require disciplined case management. This is why I provided the parties with an innovative tool, being process mediation, whereby I appointed a Member of the Tribunal in January 2010, to work with them to narrow the issues in dispute. It is, in my view, incumbent upon the Tribunal to actively manage its inquiry process from the receipt of the Commission\u2019s referral to the conclusion of either settlement or decision by utilizing all available administrative tools. This may include working with counsel and the parties to narrow the issues of fact and law that are truly in dispute actively prior to any hearing, and addressing and disposing of issues that may both be efficiently and fairly addressed prior to a full viva voce hearing. In this sense, the Tribunal, with this unique statutory framework, has greater flexibility than the courts do to manage its process, and also, may I add, has a greater responsibility. It is a specialized Tribunal that can and should identify the unique access issues in its field of expertise: e.g. costs and delay. It is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of administrative tribunals to craft unique solutions to improve access, limited only by imagination and fairness within its statutory parameters.\nThe Act does not require a viva voce hearing in all cases. The presentation of further evidence is not required where the material facts are not in dispute and where pure questions of law are to be decided. Such a process does not violate procedural fairness.\nV. OTHER ARGUMENTS RAISED BY THE PARTIES ADDRESSING WHETHER MOTION FORUM IS SUFFICIENT\nA. The Crown Argues that the Complaint Raises a Real Question of Jurisdiction which should be Heard in a Motion\nIn its motion, the Crown has described its application as one to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170 [Watkin], the Court of Appeal stated that, whether or not the action complained of was a \u201cservice\u201d is \u201ca true question of jurisdiction or vires\u201d.\nIt is true that historically, there was an attempt in the case law to identify and isolate preliminary questions which had to be answered in advance of a viva voce hearing, because they defined the jurisdiction of a Tribunal to proceed with a case (see Bell v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1971] S.C.R. 756 at p. 775; Union des employ\u00e9s de service, local 298 v. Bibeault, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048 at para. 110 [Bibeault]). However, that trend has been reversed for some time now (see Canada Union of Public Employees Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227; Bibeault, supra, at paras. 111-126). As the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal made clear in Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) v. Newfoundland (Health) (1998), 164 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 251, 31 C.H.R.R. 405, and, 13 Admin. L.R. (3d) 142 [Prior], not all jurisdictional questions lend themselves to preliminary determination:\n[17] I find myself in agreement with Hoyt, J.A., in New Brunswick (Board of Management) et al. v. New Brunswick Council of Hospital Unions et al. reflex, (1986), 77 N.B.R. (2d) 392; 195 A.P.R. 392; 35 D.L.R. (4th) 282 (C.A.), at p. 286, when he concluded that \"whether the preliminary jurisdictional question will be considered initially is, in my view, a question for the chairman to decide in his properly exercised discretion.\nThe Court of Appeal went on to note at para. 21 that a tribunal may choose to entertain an application to decide a point of law, but that generally this would occur where there was an agreed statement of fact. Furthermore, while the Tribunal could receive affidavit evidence or oral evidence and make findings of fact thereon, doing so would not be practical \u201c\u2026where the issues of fact and law are complex and intermingled. In that event, it would be more efficient to await the full hearing before ruling on the \"preliminary\" point\u201d (Prior, supra, at para. 21, emphasis added).\nThus characterizing the grounds of the Crown\u2019s motion as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d or \u201cgoing to jurisdiction\u201d does not assist in the determination of whether the issues raised should be considered in the context of a motion. With regards to preliminary jurisdictional questions, the Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that it does not \u201c\u2026wish nor intend to return to the jurisdiction\/preliminary question doctrine that plagued the jurisprudence in this area for many years\u201d (Dunsmuir, supra, at para. 59).\nB. The Crown Argues that the Complaint Raises an Abuse of Process Issue that can be Dealt with in a Motion\nAbuse of process is another issue that often lends itself to appropriate treatment in a motion. However, I do not agree with the Crown\u2019s arguments that pleading a cause of action that is beyond the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutes an abuse of its process. The Crown invokes the case of Weider v. Beco Industries Ltd., [1976] 2 F.C. 739 [Weider], as authority for the proposition. By extension, the Crown submits that bringing a complaint beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process, and thus is susceptible to summary dismissal. It is not clear to me this point was a contested issue before the Court in Weider, supra. Secondly, I am unsure how that statement in the Weider judgment, supra, would be articulated today in light of significant subsequent jurisprudence on what constitutes abuse of process (see Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 at paras. 35-36). Thirdly, the abuse of process issues that the Court found in Cremasco, supra, that could properly form the subject of preliminary disposition bore no resemblance to the jurisdictional \u201cabuse of process\u201d objections raised by the Crown in the current case. Finally, based on what I have said earlier about jurisdictional questions not automatically lending themselves to preliminary determination, I cannot accept the Weider judgment, supra, as authority for the argument that the Crown\u2019s motion, no matter how technical, complex or factually challenging it may be, nonetheless qualifies\u2014without further analysis\u2014for summary disposition outside of the formal hearing process.\nThat having been said, from the perspective of the complainant group, it argues that early dismissal is only appropriate in such cases as contemplated by this Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Harkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 CHRT 6 [Harkin]. In Harkin, supra, the Member interpreted Cremasco, supra, to restrict the Tribunal`s ability to hear summary dismissal motions to those involving a breach of natural justice, such as delay, an abuse of process, or where the issues have been heard and conclusively resolved in another forum. Inasmuch as Harkin, supra, purports to establish an exhaustive list of scenarios in which summary dismissal is permitted, I respectfully disagree. While the Tribunal in Harkin, supra, restricts Cremasco, supra, to its facts, Harkin, supra, did not directly consider the statutory language in s. 48.9(1) of the Act (\u201cinformally and expeditiously\u201d). Further, I do not view Cremasco, supra, itself as setting out an exhaustive list of scenarios where summary dismissal is appropriate. On the contrary, the Court at one point speaks in quite general terms of entertaining \u201c\u2026preliminary motions so as to clear the procedural underbrush\u201d (Cremasco, supra, at para. 14). As I have said above, I believe that the most sound and practical approach is simply for the Tribunal to review the motion record on an issue by issue basis and ensure that it adheres to the Parliamentary directions of ss. 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act.\nC. The Complainants Argue that the Test is the \u201cPlain and Obvious\u201d Test that Comes from the Courts and therefore a Motion is not Appropriate\nThe complainant parties appeared to accept the idea that the Tribunal may dismiss a complaint on a preliminary basis where it is \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the complaint cannot succeed. This legal threshold appears to originate from jurisprudence decided under rules of civil procedure allowing for the striking of a claim that did not disclose a reasonable cause of action (Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959). I agree with the Crown, that it is not appropriate to import such tests from the civil courts, which have a very different legal foundation, into the legislative scheme of the CHRA.\nAs an aside, I should note that the Tribunal has been applying the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d test when deciding whether to grant motions to amend the complaint (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 at para. 6 and 7; Warman v. Lemire, 2006 CHRT 13 at para. 4). However, this test was not adopted by the Federal Court in reviewing a Tribunal ruling that allowed an amendment to the complaint (Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313).\nI return to the test as being that if the objection can be fully and amply answered in a motion on the basis of the record generated by the motion and without having recourse to a full viva voce hearing, then the motion will be decided on such a basis. I find that the Act authorizes the Tribunal to deal with the Crown\u2019s objections in the context of a motion at this stage by determining\u2014on an issue by issue basis\u2014if the motion process was sufficient to accord the parties their rights to present their case, in particular their evidence, as contemplated by the Act.\nD. The Complainants Argue that the Earlier Federal Court Decision Requires the Tribunal to Go to a Viva Voce Hearing\nThe complainant group argues that the Federal Court has directed a viva voce hearing of the within complaint, and this order compels me to direct a viva voce hearing. I respectfully disagree. The Crown sought to have the Commission\u2019s referral decision in this case judicially reviewed. The complainants moved to strike the application for judicial review or, in the alternative, to have the Crown\u2019s application stayed pending the outcome of the proceedings before the Tribunal. The Court refused to strike the Crown\u2019s application stating that striking an application is an exceptional remedy that will be granted only in the clearest of cases (David Bull Laboratories (Can) Inc. v. Pharmacie Inc., [1995] 1 F.C. 588). Regarding the stay, Prothonotary Aronovitch applied the tripartite test established in RJR MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attoney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 and granted the complainant group\u2019s stay application. In addressing whether there is a serious question to be tried, she wrote that the complaint being serious and complex, should not be determined in summary fashion and in the absence of the factual record necessary to fully appreciate the matters in issue. Secondly, in examining the balance of convenience, she wrote that there is an interest in allowing a full and thorough examination in the specialized forum of the Tribunal, of issues which may have an impact on the future ability of Aboriginal peoples to make discrimination claims.\nI do not read these comments as detracting from the statutory direction of ss. 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act and restricting in any manner the obligation of this Tribunal to hear the Crown\u2019s motion and determine the appropriate manner of procedure in the circumstances of this case, and based upon the evidentiary record before it. Nor does the Tribunal\u2019s de novo exercise of its mandate in entertaining a motion to dismiss constitute a review of the Commission\u2019s referral as it is grounded in the CHRA. Indeed, as seen above, the motion forum provides a legitimate forum for an inquiry in appropriate cases [see Cremasco, supra]. Finally, I note in passing that the net effect of the Federal Court decision is that the Crown\u2019s motion to judicially review the Commission\u2019s referral decision is deferred pending the completion of the hearing by this Tribunal.\nE. The Crown Argues that the Complainants Have the Burden to File the Requisite Evidence\nFinally, as I have stated earlier, there is a two-pronged burden of proof in this motion on the moving party, the Crown. In its submissions, the Crown suggested that the burden in the motion was borne by the complainant group, who had to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. I disagree. It is not for the Crown to require the complainants at this stage to \u201c...lead trump or risk losing\u201d (Goudie v. Ottawa (City), 2003 SCC 14 at para. 32), and I note here that the Crown itself has taken the position that summary judgment jurisprudence is as inapplicable to the motion as jurisprudence based on motions to strike for no cause of action. Put another way, it is not incumbent on complainants to proffer their entire evidentiary record in a motion in fear of a consequential dismissal of the complaint for want of evidence. In cases where the complainant is assigned the evidentiary burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, such assignment occurs in the context of a formal \u201ctrial-model\u201d hearing, not in the context of a motion brought by the person accused of discrimination. In making submissions on the procedural onus, it is open to the complainant group to explain why the motion process itself did not afford the parties the \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to, inter alia, present evidence. If the moving party fails to satisfy its procedural onus, and the complainant group\u2019s arguments that the motion forum is incapable of satisfying its evidentiary needs are accepted, then correspondingly, one simply cannot expect a prima facie case of discrimination to be adduced. It would not be logistically or procedurally possible within the confines of the motion. Within the context of the motion, it is the moving party who is seeking a specific form of relief from the Tribunal\u2014it is for the moving party to satisfy the Tribunal that it is entitled to the specific form of relief sought (i.e. an order for summary dismissal). For these reasons, I believe that reversing the burden of proof would run afoul of the requirements of the Act and of procedural fairness.\nVI. ADDRESSING SERVICES IN A MOTION FORUM \u2013 ARE THE MATERIAL FACTS CLEAR, COMPLETE AND NOT IN DISPUTE\nA. Summary of the Positions of the Parties\nI now turn to the Crown\u2019s argument that the Tribunal should summarily dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the expenditure of funds through the FNCFS Program does not constitute a service. The Crown says that the complaint does not properly explore the relationship between INAC, the entities that receive FNCFS Program funding, and their responsibility to provide child welfare to registered First Nations children ordinarily resident on reserve, and, consequently it is not a complaint of discrimination recognized by law. Concisely, it argues that the service providers in this case are the funding recipients under the program: various corporate bodies, bands, tribal councils and governments. It is these organizations that deliver child welfare to First Nations on-reserve children and families; INAC does not provide child welfare to anyone.\nThe Crown also argues that funding decisions are not justiciable and argues that INAC\u2019s funding policy is an expression of pure executive policy that is not impeachable under the CHRA. Yet, the Crown concedes that government funding has been held to be a service where the government\u2019s role extends beyond providing funds to encompass significant obligations specific to the provision of the service itself (Written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, at p. 712, para. 66).\nRegarding the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in NIL\/TU,O, supra, the decision confirms the Crown\u2019s position that child welfare is a matter within provincial legislative authority. The Crown argues that child welfare is not a \u201cmatter\u201d coming within section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, but rather falls squarely within s. 92. Further, the Crown argues that the ordinary activities of child welfare organizations do not touch on issues of Indian status or rights, encapsulated within s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. By drawing an analogy from the labour relations issue in NIL\/TU,O, supra, the Crown gains more support for its position that child welfare is a provincial matter. Its position is supported by both the majority and minority view in NIL\/TU,O, supra. The funding of child welfare services to Indians on reserve is a matter that is integrally tied to the provincial scheme and cannot form the basis of a human rights complaint before the Tribunal.\nHowever, the complainant group resists this position by arguing that INAC\u2019s actions demonstrate that INAC exerts at least some control over child welfare through, inter alia, funding for staff and operations, compliance reviews, and review of children in care files. In response to the Crown\u2019s submissions that these actions constitute mere accountability measures, it argues that these actions should be viewed contextually and holistically in light of all other evidence proffered in a viva voce hearing. As well, it argues that the effect of the funding program demonstrates that INAC ultimately determines the type and level of child welfare. It argues that the relationship between INAC and the ultimate child welfare recipients, First Nations children and families, cannot be properly explored without the benefit of more evidence in a viva voce hearing. It says that INAC is the de facto service provider, or a co-service provider, of child welfare. The Ont. Chiefs state that further to the 1965 Agt. the federal government has responsibility for delivering child welfare, and that in this regard, INAC is not \u201ca bemused bystander\u201d (Submissions of the Chiefs of Ontario, at p. 4, para 9).\nRegarding NIL\/TU,O, supra, the complainants reply that the decision is inapplicable and distinguishable from the circumstances in the present case. They say that the decision deals exclusively with jurisdiction over labour relations, and it does not address the service or comparator issues. The complainants claim that INAC\u2019s involvement in on-reserve child welfare services is an administrative exercise of federal jurisdiction under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1987; or, in the alternative, an exercise of the federal spending power. For that reason, the complainants assert that it is Canada, and not the provinces, who determines which child welfare services are available to First Nations children on reserve.\nB. What is the Law Regarding \u201cServices\u201d?\nThe first step to be performed in applying section 5(b) of the Act is to determine whether the actions complained of are \"services\" (see Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571 per La Forest J. at para.60 [Gould]; and, Watkin, supra). \u201cServices\u201d contemplate something of benefit being \u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered\u201d to the public. Thus, enforcement actions do not constitute services as they are not \u201cheld out\u201d or \u201coffered\u201d to the public, and are not the result of a process which takes place \u201cin the context of a public relationship\u201d (Watkin, supra, at para. 31; and, Gould, surpa, at paras.16, 55 and 60). The mere fact that an action is undertaken in the public interest does not make it a \u201cservice\u201d (Watkin, supra, at para. 22). A service does not have to be available to all members of the general public in order to be \"customarily available to the general public\" (Watkin, supra; Canada (Attorney General) v Rosin, 1 F.C. 391 [Rosin]; and, University of British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 353 [Berg]).\nMost services offered by governments are open to the public. Indeed, it may well be said that virtually everything government does is done for the public, is available to the public, and is open to the public (Rosin, supra, at paras. 8 and 11). This Tribunal has found INAC to be providing a service in INAC\u2019s intercession on behalf of locatees of reserve land in arranging leases with potential lessees (Louie and Beattie v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2011 CHRT 2, at paras. 44-49, judicial review pending, file no. T-325-11).\nIt is incumbent upon the Tribunal to determine whether the impugned actions may be viewed as a service: whether government actions which are not \u201cservices\u201d within the commonly accepted meaning can nevertheless be treated as \u201cservices\u201d under section 5 of the Act (Watkin, supra, at para. 25). In Watkin, supra, enforcement actions were found not to constitute \u201cservices\u201d.\nThe question of whether government funding constitutes a \u201cservice\u201d has not been resolved under the CHRA. Some helpful principles arise out of jurisprudence from other jurisdictions where discrimination in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d is also captured by human rights legislation. For example, it has been held that the relationship or relationships between the alleged service provider and service recipient must be examined to determine whether or not any terms or conditions are imposed on the funding such as to control the content of the service (see Bitonti v. British Columbia, [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 60 at paras. 314-315 [Bitonti]; and, Donna Martyn v. Laidlaw Transit Ltd. o\/a Yellow Cab Ltd., Alberta Co-op taxi Line Ltd., Edmonton taxi commission, City of Edmonton, Alberta transportation (2005), 55 C.H.R.R. D\/235 (Alta. H.R.P.) at paras. 356-369 [Martyn]). For example, in HMTQ v. Moore et al, 2001 BCSC 336 at paras. 19-26 [Moore], where, apart from the provision of any funding, the Minister could make orders: (a) governing the provision of educational programs; (b) determining general requirements for graduation; (c) determining the general nature of education programs for use in schools; and, (d) preparing a process for the assessment of the effectiveness of educational programs, the Court held that allegations of discrimination against the Ministry should not be limited to the use or misuse of the Ministry\u2019s funding power.\nThe powers and duties of the funding government are relevant (Moore, supra). In Moore, supra, the funding Ministry had the power to tell school boards to spend certain money to provide programs to special needs students (see para. 22). On the other hand, the fact that a provincial government, for example, (i) has no supervisory role over the service system,(ii) has no statutory obligation to regulate the field, and, (iii) has delegated regulation of that field to a municipality, may be contra-indicative of that government being a service provider (Martyn, supra).\nC. Analysis \u2013 Based on the Facts\nThe evidence filed in this motion does not consist of clear, complete and uncontroverted facts. The motion record is insufficient to allow me to decide whether INAC\u2019s complex funding can be treated as a \u201cservice\u201d for the purpose of s. 5(b) of the CHRA. Some of these insufficiencies are set out below.\nFirst Nation Service Providers Receive Funding but are not the Recipients of Child Welfare\nIn this case, there is no dispute that INAC\u2019s funding is \u201cheld out\u201d or \u201coffered\u201d to the public. Rather, one significant element of the dispute centers around the differing views of the parties regarding who constitutes the \u201cpublic\u201d. Are the First Nations service providers the \u201cpublic\u201d as the direct recipients of INAC\u2019s funding? Or do First Nations children constitute the \u201cpublic\u201d? The Crown argues that the ultimate recipients of child welfare are not the service providers. The Crown argues that there is a missing link in that INAC cannot be held accountable for the First Nations children who are the recipients of child welfare. For the reasons cited, I do not accept this argument as determinative of the issue. It is not inconceivable that the CHRA may allow for a piercing of the service provider veil to understand the real relationship between INAC and First Nations children and families.\nRather, the epicentre of the dispute involves whether INAC has the authority to tell First Nations service providers how to deliver child welfare services, and whether, through the terms and conditions of the funding programs, it does so. On the other hand, if INAC lacks any supervisory role over child welfare, and it is exclusively the provinces that supervise child welfare, then INAC may not be viewed as providing a \u201cservice\u201d.\nLegislative jurisdiction over \u201cIndians\u201d and lands reserved for \u201cIndians\u201d is a federal matter. Legislative jurisdiction over child welfare for all children in the province is a provincial matter. The evidence filed in this motion does not demonstrate with any sufficient degree of precision:\n1. the terms and conditions of the funding throughout INAC\u2019s complex funding scheme and whether INAC engages in control and\/or delivery of child welfare in any discrete area through such terms and conditions;\n2. whether INAC defines the content of child welfare, for example, whether INAC dictates what kinds of child welfare interventions short of maintenance are available to children and families; and,\n3. whether INAC has a supervisory role over child welfare and engages in the assessment of child welfare services through actions such as auditing and administrative reviews.\ni. Crown has not Demonstrated Clear, Complete and Uncontroverted Material Facts\nAlthough the Crown brings this motion for a determination that funding is not a service, it has not filed the requisite evidence for me to decide the question.\nFurther, while the parties have filed some evidence, even then, they do not agree on the material facts and the inferences to be drawn from the facts.\nThe Commission in its referral of the complaint to the Tribunal for a hearing further to s. 49 of the Act took the position that \u201chaving regard to all of the circumstances it is apparent that inquiry is warranted and that an investigation would likely not be administratively efficient or effective in exploring the human rights allegations and reaching findings as the main arguments being adduced are legal and not factual in nature and are not settled in law\u201d [(First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and Assembly of First Nations v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, decision 20061060 of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, September 30, 2008). I observe that the arguments adduced by the Commission in this motion are different from those outlined in its referral. As stated, the Tribunal invited the parties to file an Agreed Statement of Facts in order to move expeditiously to a hearing. The Tribunal Chairperson assigned another Tribunal Member to help the parties to come to an agreement on the material facts: although the parties had represented to the Tribunal that they were circulating an Agreed Statement of Facts in December 2009, and then continued to work on the same through the assistance of the process mediator. In March 2010, several parties precipitously chose not to proceed with work on an Agreed Statement of Facts pending the release of this decision. An Agreed Statement of Facts would have been of assistance to me in understanding the factual basis and dealing with the issue in the motion.\nThe Crown filed one eight page affidavit and its motion record of some 690 pages. The Crown\u2019s one affiant, Ms. Johnston, was not directly and personally involved in the delivery of child welfare by a First Nation service provider. I note that the Crown\u2019s proposed witness list includes persons who appear to be able to provide potentially useful evidence in a full viva voce hearing: i.e., INAC staff including Senior Policy Advisors regarding funding flows to recipients, managers regarding specific agreements \/ arrangements in specific provinces and memoranda of understanding and calculations of maintenance rates and reimbursements, acting regional directors regarding specific provincial models, and operational specialists. The Crown is anticipated to file a funding chart (Process Mediation Report #2, June 30, 2010, at para. 2). However, it did not do so for this motion.\n1. Complicated Funding Agreements \u2013 Not Filed\nINAC\u2019s funding supports 108 First Nations service providers to deliver child welfare to approximately 160,000 children and youth in approximately 447 of 663 First Nations (Cross-Examination of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 7, at pp. 337-338). However, the funding has many shades and permutations across the various provinces and the Yukon Territory. For example, in the Yukon, INAC funds the Yukon government for child welfare for all Indian children on and off reserve. The Crown has not filed each of the relevant agreements. Only one funding arrangement with a funding agency was filed in this motion. As noted, the scope and breadth of this complaint exceeds any complaint filed with the Tribunal to date and encompasses INAC\u2019s funding across Canada, involving at the minimum, 50 to 60 funding agreements with respect to Directive 20-1 alone.\n2. Witnesses are Needed to Clarify Funding Agreement that is Filed and Are Yet to be Filed\nThe complainant group filed the National Program Manual (NPM) that contains Directive 20-1. Directive 20-1 outlines the funding applicable to B.C., Manitoba, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon Territory. The NPM is riddled with provisions that are not clear on their face to this Tribunal, and which the rest of the record fails to clarify: the Backgrounder refers to the primary program objective as being to \u201csupport culturally appropriate\u201d child and family services for Indian children and families resident on reserve, in the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d, in accordance with provincial legislation and standards (National Program Manual, Backgrounder, clause 1.3.2, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 3B). The policy is an interim step in \u201cmoving toward self-government\u201d (National Program Manual, Backgrounder, clause 1.3.3, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 3B). The child and family services offered by First Nations service providers on reserve are to be \u201cculturally relevant and comparable\u201d but not \u201cnecessarily identical\u201d to those offered by the provinces off reserve in \u201csimilar circumstances\u201d (National Program Manual, Backgrounder, clause 1.3.5, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 3B). The Crown\u2019s evidence and submissions do not show what the various provincial statutes mandate, particularly in terms of \u201ccultural relevance\u201d for First Nations children. Thus, it is premature to determine the issues of control and the content of child and family services.\nThe funding architecture pertaining to Directive 20-1 alone is complex and involves numerous funding agreements and memoranda of understanding. The only agreement filed on the motion pertaining to Directive 20-1, is a sample Manitoba Comprehensive Funding Arrangement between INAC and the Southeast Child and Family Services Inc. (Comprehensive Funding Arrangement) filed by the complainant group. INAC provides almost seventeen million dollars to the agency to be used for the purposes of providing child welfare to 10 First Nations in Manitoba including Bloodvein and Buffalo Point.\nMs. Johnston, on the behalf of the Crown, in her affidavit, outlines who provides child welfare in each of the 4 provinces and 1 territory implicated in Directive 20-1 (Affidavit of Ms. Odette Johnston, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 2, at para. 15). From this deposition, one can deduce that funding in Newfoundland may involve 2 INAC agreements and 3 provincial government agreements; funding in New Brunswick may involve 2 INAC agreements and 14 provincial government agreements; funding in Manitoba may involve 14 INAC agreements; funding in British Columbia may involve 21 INAC agreements as well as self-government agreements; while, funding in the Yukon may involve one agreement. As well, I note from Ms. Johnston\u2019s affidavit that in Saskatchewan, even though it is largely under the EPFA, there are still 2 (two) agency agreements under Directive 20-1. The EPFA is INAC\u2019s enhanced and alternative funding approach to Directive 20-1, first approved in 2007 for implementation in Alberta. Since its implementation, four other provinces also agreed to transition from Directive 20-1 to this approach. Yet, the EPFA and relevant agreements thereto are not filed. In Ontario the 1965 Agt. has been amended 4 times. In total, from this review of the record, potentially 60 agreements relevant to Directive 20-1 are implicated. There are more under the EPFA. The Crown has not filed these.\n3. The Terms and Conditions of the NPM are not Clear\nThe existence and nature of the terms and conditions are far from clear. The NPM contains only some of the terms and conditions of the funding while others are oral (Cross-Examination of Ms. Odette Johnston, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 6, at pp. 210-211). At one point in her cross-examination, Ms. Johnston indicates that the terms and conditions are not found in the NPM; rather they may be contained in INAC\u2019s Treasury Board submission and are verbally communicated to First Nations agencies. Neither her cross-examination, nor her affidavit, clearly elucidate what the terms and conditions are and how they are to be implemented, by whom, and how they affect the delivery of child welfare. The Crown\u2019s written argument is also deficient regarding the terms and conditions. The Crown writes: \u201cINAC enters into funding agreements and memoranda of understanding with recipients containing express terms and conditions\u201d ( Written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, at p. 705, para. 45). Yet, the Crown fails to outline the same, nor has the Crown explained how the unwritten terms and conditions of the FNCFS program interact with the written terms and conditions in the funding arrangements.\n4. Self-Government Agreements not Filed \u2013 Insufficient Evidence\nAs well, there are cursory references in the transcript to self-government agreements, none of which are filed in this motion. For example, see reference to the Spallumcheen First Nations in B.C. (Cross-Examination of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 7, at p. 329). It is unclear from the record what arguments the parties seek to advance about these.\n5. The Evidence does not Clarify how the Comprehensive Funding Arrangement Works\nThe complainant group filed the Comprehensive Funding Arrangement between Manitoba and the Southeast Child and Family Services Inc.. It states that INAC provides monies (e.g.: about 17 million dollars in one case) to the agency on the condition that these funds are to be used for child welfare in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement (Comprehensive Funding Arrangement, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 4A, at 2.1). Yet the agreement expressly provides that INAC may reduce the funding if the Minister varies the formula. It states, notwithstanding any provision of the agreement, in the event that there is a change in the formula established by the Minister, INAC may reduce the level of funding payable to the agency First Nations service provider (Comprehensive Funding Arrangement, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 4A, at 2.5.2 (e)). The agreement does not appear to qualify how or when the Minister may vary the formula. The prerequisites for the exercise of such Ministerial discretion, if any, are crucial to the issue of INAC\u2019s control of child welfare. The Crown has not clarified this agreement and how First Nations child welfare works in Manitoba under this arrangement. At this juncture, I cannot decide, on the evidentiary record, if this ability to vary the formula constitutes an indicium of control of child welfare by INAC, or whether it supports the conclusion that INAC determines the content of child welfare services.\nIn Manitoba there are four authorities that oversee, monitor and support agencies that provide direct child welfare on and off reserve. It appears that there are 14 First Nations service providers in Manitoba, and 10 of the funding arrangements are administered by the Southern Authority (Affidavit of Ms. Odette Johnston, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 2; and, affidavit of Ms. Elsie Flette, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 4). The remaining 4 are potentially administered by the other three authorities. In short, for Manitoba alone, there are at least 13 other such funding arrangements that have not been filed by the Crown.\n6. The Evidence does not Clarify how the 1965 Agreement Works and if all Relevant Agreements are Filed\nFurther to the 1965 Agt., Ontario funds non-profit children\u2019s aid societies and INAC reimburses Ontario for a percentage of the costs of child welfare expenses incurred in Ontario, in respect of on-reserve children. Yet the effective date of the 1965 Agt. is December 1, 1965, and it may be terminated by either party with 12 months written notice (1965 Welfare Agreement, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 8A, at 8(1)). Witnesses would need to speak to this clause, because its existence (and potential invocation by the government parties) could shed light on the extent of INAC\u2019s role in the provision of the subject services. Another example of documents in the record which require further explanation is a series of instruments that purport to be amendments to the 1965 Agt. by way of memoranda dated in 1971, 1972, 1981, and 1998. The evidence does not clarify the status of the various services referred to in the 1965 Agt., the status of the referenced enabling legislation, or the status of the various amendments and their substantive implications. In Ontario, there are specific service agreements between Ontario and both mandated and non-mandated First Nations child and family service organizations\/ children\u2019s aid societies (Cross-Examination of Tom Goff, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 8, at p. 456). Again, the Crown has not filed such agreements, nor has it explained how they operate vis-\u00e0-vis INAC funding.\n7. Cannot Determine if INAC Controls Preventative Measures\nThe complainant group has emphasized that INAC\u2019s newest funding regime, the EPFA, is still deficient with respect to funding for portions of child welfare programming such as preventative measures (programs to reduce the risk of removal of children from their families). INAC\u2019s funding continues to require that First Nations service providers meet provincial standards. Both Directive 20-1 and the EPFA purport to provide funding for these types of services (Affidavit of Ms. Odette Johnston, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 2). It would have been helpful for the Crown to have indicated whether the various provincial statutes mandate preventative measures.\n8. Cannot Determine if INAC Takes Actions Beyond Auditing for Accountability\nINAC conducts audits and administrative and compliance reviews of First Nations service providers. In the course of such reviews, INAC examines children in care files, reviews board of governor minutes for content, as agencies in Manitoba conduct criminal record checks of staff (Cross-Examination of Ms. Elsie Flette, written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada in support of the motion to dismiss the complaint, Tab 9), reviews service provider board by-laws and amendments, and issues deficiency letters. While, the Crown\u2019s position that INAC only audits for financial accountability may be a valid argument, the Crown has filed only cursory evidence about the audit and review procedures. The evidence does not demonstrate the audit procedures comprehensively vis-\u00e0-vis the various funding agreements.\nD. Conclusion - The Crown has not met its Onus \u2013 Crown has not Filed Sufficient Evidence or Made Sufficient Submissions to Demonstrate that the Funding Program is not a Service\nIn conclusion, the Crown has not demonstrated that the motion forum provides a full and ample opportunity for the exploration of the \u201cservices\u201d issue. The fact that the Crown failed to file, or was unable to file the necessary materials in this motion, in and of itself, demonstrates the complexity of this issue, and the need for a viva voce hearing as sought by the complainant group. The true nature of the funding program, and its impact on funding recipients, remains obscure, notwithstanding the documents, affidavits and transcripts filed.\nHowever, my comments on this \u201cservices\u201d issue are not meant in any way to negate the need for diligent case management of the presentation of evidence on this point were the issue ever to proceed to a viva voce hearing.\nAs observed earlier, the magnitude and scope of this complaint is unprecedented in the Tribunal\u2019s history. It comprehensively challenges INAC\u2019s funding across Canada, across all provinces and one territory, across all funding recipients and First Nations communities, in one broad brush. In this case, the Tribunal is asked to consider the relationship between the federal government, eleven different provincial\/territorial jurisdictions, and 108 First Nations service providers. The factual foundations of this complaint reach deep into the crevices of INAC federal policies, guidelines, funding agreements, and provincial and territorial statutes, practices, policies and guidelines regarding child welfare, and inter-jurisdictional child welfare agreements. The determination of the \u201cservices\u201d issue may not be possible on a generalized basis, for all child welfare services agencies. In the substantive hearing, the complainants must be able to show that the federal government is involved in the provision of child welfare services in the circumstances of each of these child welfare agencies. Ultimately, the services question is a fact driven inquiry. The precise nature and extent of INAC\u2019s decision-making needs to be assessed through the prism of the myriad subordinate arrangements and agreements, in order to ascertain the impact of this decision-making on the services received, on reserve, by First Nations children and families. The Crown\u2019s record makes clear that the motion was not an adequate vehicle for this aspect of the inquiry.\nE. Regarding the Crown\u2019s Other Arguments\ni. NIL\/TU,O - Evidence\nThe Tribunal allowed the parties to make submissions regarding the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in NIL\/TU,O, supra. Although not determinative of the \u201cservices\u201d issue, the analysis in that case provides the Tribunal with an outline of the type of information it needs to appropriately render a decision pertaining to \u201cservices\u201d in this case. In NIL\/TU,O, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada examined some of the following factors in making its determination regarding the constitutional jurisdiction of NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society\u2019s labour relations: the tripartite delegation agreement between the province of British Columbia, the federal government and the NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society; its relationship to the British Columbia Child, Family and Community Service Act; a \u201cDelegation Matrix\u201d appended to the tripartite delegation agreement; the Aboriginal Operational and Practice Standards and Indicators; federal program Directive 20-1; and, the specific operations of the NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society. The same type of information was also used to determine the labour relations jurisdiction of Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, in Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, supra. In NIL\/TU,O, supra, and Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, supra, the determination of the labour relations jurisdiction involved only one child welfare agency respectively.\nii. Justiciability\nFinally, regarding the Crown\u2019s arguments that INAC\u2019s funding policy is an expression of pure executive policy that is not impeachable under the CHRA are not helpful. They miss the mark of the requisite services analysis. The doctrine of justiciability is fundamentally concerned with the proper ambit of the Court\u2019s function and authority in relation to the other institutions of government. Thus, in Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, one finds the observation that:\nIn exercising its discretion whether to determine a matter that is alleged to be non-justiciable, the Court's primary concern is to retain its proper role within the constitutional framework of our democratic form of government. [emphasis added]\nSimilarly, in Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217 at para. 26, one finds the question of justiciability defined in terms of whether the issue put forward would take the Court beyond its own assessment of its proper role in the constitutional framework of our democratic form of government or whether the Court is able to give an answer that lies within its area of expertise: the interpretation of law. Finally, in Bruker v. Marcovitz, 2007 SCC 54 at para. 41, the majority of the Court relying on Dean Sossin\u2019s work, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1999)\u2014a text also relied upon by the Crown in the motion before me\u2014defined \u201cjusticiability\u201d as a set of judge-made rules, norms and principles delineating the scope of judicial intervention in social, political and economic life. In addressing a complaint under the CHRA, the provisions of the CHRA itself govern as opposed to \u201cjudge-made rules\u201d. Any exemption from its provisions must be clearly stated (Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30 at para. 81 [Vaid]).\nThe Crown argues that a federal transfer of funds has not attracted legal liability in claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty because there is insufficient proximity between the funder and those providing the service (Aksidan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 BCCA 43 at paras.13-15; and, Reference re Broome v. Prince Edward Island, 2010 SCC 11 at para. 45). First, as a matter of principle, I observe that these cases apply the law as it evolves from areas that cannot provide direct assistance to the Tribunal (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84; and, Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268). Further, to the extent that they are insightful, they support the need for an examination of the extent of a Crown exercise of control of funding and the proximity to the ultimate service recipient through a thorough examination of the relationship between INAC and First Nations children and families.\nVII. ADDRESSING COMPARATOR IN A MOTION FORUM \u2013 QUESTION OF LAW\nA. Summary of the Positions of the Parties\nThe Crown\nThe Crown argues that s. 5(b) of the Act requires that in order to find adverse differentiation, a comparator is required. It further argues that there must be a difference in the provision of services to two different individuals or service recipients. The section does not allow a comparison between two different service providers serving two different \u201cpublics\u201d. Further, the section does not allow comparisons between the federal government and the provinces. The Crown supports the precepts of the importance of human rights legislation but disagrees that the complaint falls within the statutory mandate of the Act. While, the Crown acknowledges that it has a fiduciary obligation towards First Nations peoples, it submits that such a duty and other international commitments do not expand the statutory reach of s. 5(b) of the CHRA.\nComplainant Group\nThe complainant group argues that s. 5(b) of the CHRA must be read with a large and liberal interpretation in keeping with the quasi-constitutional nature of the Act. It argues that the very purpose of the Act is to remedy discrimination, including systemic discrimination. It argues that a purposive reading of s. 5(b) of the CHRA does not necessitate a comparison at all. It argues that failure to identify an appropriate comparator is not fatal to the complaint and cites the example of people with disabilities who are not required to demonstrate differential treatment in successfully raising a discrimination claim. The group argues that the focus should be on whether a service meets the needs of those who experience adverse treatment due to an immutable personal characteristic.\nSecond, in the alternative, it submits that s. 5(b) of the Act may be read to allow a comparison to be made between two different service providers, and that these may be INAC and the provinces. The complainant group argues that the Crown has not explained why the use of another service provider, being a province, is inappropriate and that the Crown has no precedent for disallowing cross-jurisdictional comparators. Further, it argues that within the context of a viva voce hearing, the appropriateness of such a comparison will become readily apparent.\nAdditionally, AFN proposes that on-reserve First Nations children who are receiving child welfare through INAC may be compared to on-reserve First Nations children who are receiving child welfare through the provincial system.\nFinally, the complainant group advocates that INAC is the sole provider of race-based child welfare that ultimately benefits First Nations children residing on reserve. This is the consequence of the constitutional division of powers wherein the federal government has jurisdiction pursuant to section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This constitutional reality prevents the rigid application of the traditional section 5(b) test outlined in Singh, supra, and prevents the application of the Act to this entire group of Canadian children. Requiring a comparator in this case cannot be the interpretation consonant with the intent of Parliament. Nor can it be reconciled with jurisprudence espousing the quasi-constitutional nature of human rights legislation and its large and liberal interpretation. This is particularly the case given the fiduciary obligations of the Crown toward First Nations people and Canada\u2019s endorsement of the UNDRIP. This legal impediment does not exist in any other case where the s. 5(b) analysis under the CHRA has been developed and applied. The effect of ruling that a comparator is not required and\/or not using a discrimination analysis involving two service providers, is tantamount to sustaining a racial construction of discrimination wherein First Nations children residing on reserves are deprived of equal or similar child welfare to all other Canadian children.\nB. The Comparator Issue is a True Question of Law\nHas the complainant group had a full and ample opportunity to present the evidence and make submissions required by the Act to address this comparator issue? This is a pure question of law. Indeed, as noted, the Commission\u2019s referral of the complaint characterized the issues raised by the complaint as ones of law, and not fact. The parties have had extensive opportunities to present their submissions and even additional submissions. On this issue, the parties have had a full and ample opportunity to file affidavits, cross-examine on affidavits, appear before the Tribunal with the help of their lawyers, submit arguments and present evidence (see Appendix \u201cA\u201d). Further, the parties were granted an opportunity to file submissions until August 23, 2010 and December 23, 2010, respectively with respect to three new decisions being NBHRC v. PNB, supra, released on June 3, 2010, and two decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada being NIL\/TU,O, supra, and Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, supra, rendered together on November 4, 2010, and with respect to the UNDRIP. No further evidence in a further viva voce hearing can make this legal issue any clearer.\nC. What Does \u201cDifferentiate Adversely\u201d Mean in the Context of Section 5(b) of the Act? How is s. 5(b) of the Act to be Interpreted?\nSection 5 of the Act states:\nDenial of good, service, facility or accommodation\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n1976-77, c. 33, s. 5.\nRefus de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou d\u2019h\u00e9bergement\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n1976-77, ch. 33, art. 5.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has a specific procedure to be followed when interpreting bilingual statutes (R. v. Daoust, 2004 SCC 6 at para. 27 [Daoust]). The first step is to determine whether there is discordance between the English and French versions of s. 5(b) of the Act and, if so, whether a shared meaning can be found (see R. v. S.A.C., 2008 SCC 47 at para. 15 [S.A.C.]; Daoust, supra, at para. 27). If s. 5(b) of the CHRA may have different meanings, the Tribunal has to determine what kind of discrepancy is involved. In The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, 3rd ed. (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 2000), C\u00f4t\u00e9 suggests that there are three possibilities. First, the English and French versions may be irreconcilable. In such cases, it will be impossible to find a shared meaning and the ordinary rules of interpretation will accordingly apply (S.A.C., supra, at para. 15; Daoust, supra, at para. 27; C\u00f4t\u00e9, supra, at p. 327). Second, one version may be ambiguous while the other is plain and unequivocal. The shared meaning will then be that of the version that is plain and unambiguous (S.A.C., supra, at para. 15; Daoust, supra, at para. 28; C\u00f4t\u00e9, supra, at p. 327). Third, one version may have a broader meaning than the other. Where one of the two versions is broader than the other, the common meaning would favour the more restricted or limited meaning (S.A.C., supra, at para. 15; Daoust, supra, at para. 29; C\u00f4t\u00e9, supra, at p. 327). At the second step, it must be determined whether the shared meaning is consistent with Parliament\u2019s intent (S.A.C., supra, at para. 16; Daoust, supra, at para. 30; C\u00f4t\u00e9, supra, at p. 328).\nIn Vaid, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that proper statutory interpretation requires that \u201c...the words of an Act [\u2026] be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (at para. 80).\nSuch interpretative principles apply with special force in the application of human rights laws given the quasi-constitutional status of the Act (Vaid, supra, at paras. 80-81). While it is accepted that human rights statutes are to be interpreted in a \u201clarge and liberal\u201d fashion, it is also well established that the words of the statute must be capable of bearing the interpretation sought (Gould, supra, at para. 13). This approach is reinforced by s. 12 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which provides that \u201c[e]very enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects\u201d. In Berg, supra, former Chief Justice Lamer had this to say about the \u201cbroad, liberal and purposive approach\u201d in applying it to the British Columbia human rights statute:\nThis interpretive approach does not give a board or court license to ignore the words of the Act in order to prevent discrimination wherever it is found. While this may be a laudable goal, the legislature has stated, through the limiting words in s. 3, that some relationships will not be subject to scrutiny under human rights legislation. It is the duty of boards and courts to give s. 3 a liberal and purposive construction, without reading the limiting words out of the Act or otherwise circumventing the intention of the legislature. [emphasis added]\n(at p. 371)\nWithin this analysis the intention of Parliament must be respected. The CHRA is a statutory creature with its genesis within the legislative control of the Parliament. Any exemption from its provisions must be clearly stated (Vaid, supra, at para. 81). International covenants, such as the UNDRIP, may inform the contextual approach to statutory interpretation (see Baker, supra). However, \u201ceffect cannot be given to unincorporated international norms that are inconsistent with the clear provisions of an Act of Parliament\u201d (Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 89 at para. 36). Thus, the starting point of any analysis is to carefully scrutinize the specific provision at issue.\nD. Analysis\ni. Adverse Differentiation is a Comparative Concept\n1. No Shared Meaning \u2013 English is Clear but French May or May Not Require a Comparator\nIn English, the plain meaning of \u201cdifferentiate adversely\u201d necessitates a comparison between two groups. The word \u201cadverse\u201d in a legal context is to be \u201copposed\u201d or \u201ccontrary\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6th ed., s.v. \u201cAdverse\u201d) and \u201cdifferentiates\u201d in the ordinary context means \u201crecognize or identify as different, distinguish\u201d (The Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed., s.v. \u201cDifferentiates\u201d). The plain meaning of the phrase requires a comparison through the word \u201cdifferentiate\u201d. \u201cDifferentiate\u201d involves being different from something or someone else. It involves distinguishing, or the drawing of a distinction. In order to determine whether there has been adverse differential treatment on the basis of a proscribed ground, by definition, it is necessary to compare the situation of the complainant with that of a different individual.\nIn French, the plain meaning of \u201cd\u00e9favoriser\u201d in s. 5(b) of the Act does not necessarily require a comparator. The definition may include a comparative concept: \u201cpriver d\u2019un avantage\u201d, \u201cpriver d\u2019un avantage (consenti a un autre ou qu\u2019on aurait pu lui consentir)\u201d import a comparison; however, \u201cdesservir\u201d, \u201cfrustrer, handicaper\u201d do not import a comparison (le Petit Robert, 2006, s.v. \u201cd\u00e9favoriser\u201d). The first group includes the possibility of a comparison while the second group of words do not. The meaning is ambiguous in that it can have two meanings. Accordingly, the normal rules of statutory construction must be utilized to determine Parliamentary intention.\n2. Parliament Intended that s. 5(b) of the Act be Interpreted as Requiring the Making of a Comparison\nThe Act is a unique creature of Parliament and s. 5(b) is unique and specific to the aspirations of Parliament within the CHRA. The historical genesis of s. 5 of the Act is closely linked to the prohibition of discrimination in employment and adverse differentiation during the course of employment. The Act originated from piece meal disparate legislation stemming largely out of proscribing discrimination in employment, but also from censuring discrimination against persons in public services (see W.S. Tarnopolsky, J., Discrimination and the Law, rev. by W. Pentney (Toronto: Carswell, 1993) (ongoing supplement) at pp. 2-3 - 2-4). This is salient as the phrase \u201cdifferentiate adversely\u201d is common to sections 6(b) and 7(b) of the Act as well. Thus the analysis used in s. 5(b) of the CHRA is equally applicable to the areas of employment and commercial tenancy. The interpretation of s. 5(b) must be equally coherent and appropriate for sections 6(b) and 7(b) of the Act.\nThe scheme and object of the Act can be gleaned from s. 2 being the purpose section wherein the Act enshrines the principle that \u201call individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals...\u201d. The French text uses the phrase \u201c\u2026\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement\u2026\u201d. The purpose section affirms that the CHRA is founded upon a comparator concept. In both English and French the concept of equality denotes a comparative concept. \u201cEqual\u201d as used in law implies \u201c...not identity but duality and the use of one thing as the measure of another\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6th ed., s.v. \u201cEqual\u201d). \u201cEqual\u201d as used generally means \u201c... the same in quantity, quality, size, degree, rank, level etc.\u201d (The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 9th ed., s.v. \u201cEqual\u201d). In French, \u201c\u00e9galit\u00e9\u201d is derived from the word \u201c\u00e9gal\" which means \u201c[q]ui est de m\u00eame quantit\u00e9, dimension, nature, qualit\u00e9 ou valeur\u201d (le Petit Robert, 2006, s.v. \u201c\u00e9gal\u201d). The definitions in both languages impute a comparison.\nIndeed, the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh, supra, at para. 17, restated the s. 5(b) test in algebraic terms: it is a discriminatory practice for A, in providing services to B, to differentiate on prohibited grounds in relation to C. The Court illustrated this by using a concrete example: it would be a discriminatory practice for a policeman who, in providing traffic control services to the general public, to treat one violator more harshly than another because of his national or racial origins.\nMore recent jurisprudence continues to confirm the need for a comparator. Mactavish J. in Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490 [Walden], pronounced as follows:\nEquality is inherently a comparative concept. In order to determine whether there has been adverse differential treatment on the basis of a proscribed ground, it is therefore necessary to compare the situation of the complainant group with that of a different group. [at para. 78]\nIn Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154, while Evans J. did not squarely address the issue of comparator, he implicitly accepted the need for comparative evidence in addressing the evidentiary burden of the prima facie case:\nMoreover, as counsel for the Commission pointed out, it is now recognized that comparative evidence of discrimination comes in many more forms than the particular one identified in Shakes. [at para. 28]\nOne may also refer to Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. M.N.R., 2003 FC 1280 [Wignall], wherein O'Reilly J. wrote,\nA court or tribunal cannot decide whether a person has been discriminated against without making comparisons to the treatment of other persons. Comparisons are inevitable. [at para. 22]\n3. Arguments to Use Case Law Arising Under Charter not Faithful to the CHRA\nAt this juncture it is important to distinguish jurisprudence arising out of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 [Charter]. The specific wording of the Act in s. 5(b) of the CHRA \u201cdifferentiate adversely\u201d must be respected. Jurisprudence emanating from the Charter may be helpful to the analysis. However, it cannot be transposed unsupervised into the CHRT regime without a careful search for Parliament\u2019s intent. In Wignall, supra, the Federal Court found that the Tribunal had erred when it said that there has been a convergence in the approaches under human rights statutes and subsection 15(1) of the Charter. The Federal Court found that the Tribunal made an error when it analysed the complaint according to the full terms of the decision in Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 [Law]. In particular, the Federal Court stated that the \u201c...definition of \"discrimination\" under subsection 15(1) of the Charter, and outlined in the Law, supra, case, does not apply to human rights legislation\u201d [Wignall, supra, at para. 8]. The Federal Court went on to explain that Law, supra, is concerned with the meaning to be given to the constitutional standard of equality as set out in the Charter, and the Supreme Court gave no indication that its approach should apply more broadly to human rights codes or statutes, whether in provincial or federal law.\nFor the same reasons, I do not find the decision in Cunningham v. Alberta (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2009 ABCA 239, to be useful in determining this case. This decision arose out of a request for a declaration that ss. 75 and 90(1)(a) of the M\u00e9tis Settlements Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. M-14, breach ss. 2(d), 7, and 15(1) of the Charter. The Alberta Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis focused exclusively on the third stage of the Law, supra, analysis, namely, whether the differential treatment amounted to discrimination.\nI would add as a final point on this issue that none of the complainant group before me has contested the constitutional validity of s. 5(b) of the CHRA.\n4. Arguments to Use Case Law Arising Under Other Human Rights Statutes not Faithful to the CHRA\nThe Society argues that the failure to identify an appropriate comparator should not be fatal to a discrimination complaint given that it is unclear whether comparator groups are required in human rights analysis. The Society refers to Lane v. ADGA Group Consultants Inc. (2008), 295 D.L.R. (4th) 425, 91 O.R. (3d) 649 (Ont. Sup. Ct. J. (Div. Ct.)) [ADGA]. This is an employment termination case grounded in Ontario\u2019s Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H-19. In the ADGA judgment, supra, the Court makes clear at para. 94 that \u201c[i]n cases of disability in the employee termination context, it is not necessary or appropriate to have to establish a comparator group\u201d. Disability cases bring with them particular and individualized situations. Once it is established that the termination of the employee was because of, or in part because of, the disability, the claimant has established a prima facie case of discrimination. Thus, the lack of need for a comparator group in ADGA, supra, was largely driven by the fact that\u2014unlike the case before me\u2014it involved termination of employment in the context of disability.\nMoreover, the result in ADGA, supra, is not surprising when one considers that Parliament has dispensed with the need for a comparator in termination cases under the CHRA (see s. 7(a)), nor does it require a comparator in cases where there is a denial of services (see s. 5(a)), a denial of occupancy of premises (see s. 6(a)), or a denial of residential accommodation (see s. 6(a)). However, Parliamentary intention may be very different between the same subsections of a section of the Act. Thus, in contrast to the foregoing provisions, sections 5(b), 6(b) and 7(b) of the Act specifically mention \u201cdifferentiate adversely\u201d and a comparator analysis is therefore called for. The ADGA case, supra, cannot be invoked to defeat Parliament\u2019s clearly articulated legislative choices.\nFor the same reasons, I do not find the comments in NBHRC v. PNB, supra, to be of much assistance to this Tribunal in interpreting the specific wording of the CHRA. The New Brunswick human rights statute addresses denial of services and sanctions discrimination vis-\u00e0-vis the provision of services. It does not address adverse differential treatment as does the CHRA.\n5. Conclusion\nAccordingly, section 5(b) of the Act requires a comparison. This is the meaning that, in my view is most consistent with the words, scheme and object of the Act, and with Parliament\u2019s intent.\nii. Section 5(b) does not Allow for Comparisons Between Two Service Providers\nNeither the English nor the French text of s. 5(b) of the Act expressly state that only one service provider may be used in making a finding of adverse differentiation. However, in my view, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words of s. 5(b) of the CHRA contemplate that a single service provider is to be held accountable for adverse differentiation in the provision of services to two different persons. This is consistent with the analysis in Singh, supra.\nFurthermore, the use of more than one service provider expands the reach of the section to nonsensical parameters. Any expansion of s. 5(b) mandates a similar expansion of sections 6(b) and 7(b) of the Act. To accept an interpretation that one service provider may be compared to another, and that more than one employer may be compared to another, is to open the flood gates to a barrage of new types of complaints not only in services, but also in employment. For example, an employee of one employer could complain that she is being adversely differentiated against when compared to an employee of a different employer (e.g. an employee of Bank \u201cA\u201d could complain of differential benefits when compared to an employee of Bank \u201cB\u201d; a First Nations employee of a First Nation in Ontario could complain of differential employment policies from an employee of a First Nation in British Columbia). In the area of services alone, a customer of Restaurant \u201cA\u201d could complain of differential treatment in services from a customer of Restaurant \u201cB\u201d on the basis of race. A First Nations member of a First Nation in Quebec could complain of differential funding when compared to a First Nations member of a different First Nation in Alberta, arguing that race was a factor as the First Nations only serves First Nations persons.\nFinally, the addition of the constitutional separation of powers adds an additional layer of complexity that makes the comparison even more illogical. How and when could federal government department employers be compared to provincial government employers, and federal departmental funders with provincial departmental funders?\nThe interpretation of section 5(b) of the Act that the complainant group advocates is so expansive and has such far reaching implications that it could not, in my respectful view, have been contemplated by Parliament. Such a sea-change in the analytical framework would require in my view clear direction from Parliament.\niii. Complainants\u2019 Arguments that Race Based Funding Require an Interpretative Exception \u2013 Hard Facts Make Bad Law\nThe complainant group urges me to accept that no comparator is required in a case where the services are being delivered only to one race or people. Upon extensive reflection of the complainant group\u2019s position, I note that the preferential interpretation of the complainant group would result in potentially incongruous and illogical ramifications for First Nations themselves.\nThe Crown is not the only provider of race based services. As stated above, in my view, if race based considerations could be given significant credence within the current statutory language in a manner such as to place liability upon INAC, the analysis would also extend to liability, in other cases, squarely upon First Nations themselves. First Nations, as does INAC, provide race based services to their members. First Nations provide education, housing, social services, and all other services to their members. The proffered analysis would dictate that one First Nation could potentially be compared to another First Nation with respect to the level of funding and services that a Nation provides to its members. Each First Nation could be compared to services rendered by the provinces and others. This analysis would potentially encompass each First Nation and potentially bind it to provide a level of funding and services comparable to other First Nations and provinces.\nThe complainant group cites CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, as being a ground-breaking novel case from its day that demonstrates that the Tribunal may and should enlarge the traditional application of the Act to new areas of alleged discrimination. In that case, Action Travail des Femmes alleged that CN was guilty of discriminatory hiring and promotion practices by denying employment opportunities to women in certain unskilled blue-collar positions. The Tribunal found that the recruitment, hiring and promotion policies at CN prevented and discouraged women from working on blue-collar jobs. Pursuant to section s. 41(2)(a) [now s. 53(2)(a)] of the Act, the Tribunal imposed an employment equity program on CN to address the problem of systemic discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women. The question put before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether the Tribunal had the power to impose an employment equity program under s. 41(2)(a) of the Act. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the order directing an employment equity program as falling within the scope of - or meeting the requirements of - s. 41(2) of the Act. While the order was unique there was a clear legislative base for the direction made. Furthermore, the Tribunal in that case did not contemplate a new area of alleged discrimination; rather, it explored the extent of its remedial powers. As a result, this case is distinguishable from the circumstances in the present case.\nThe complainant group also relied on the decision in Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. v. Gibbs, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 566 [Gibbs], to support the arguments proffered. In that case, a Saskatchewan insurance company discriminated against mentally disabled insured persons when compared to physically disabled insured persons. The case involved one service provider and how it could not discriminate between two service recipients on these grounds by narrowing the parameters of service recipients. The group\u2019s argument that the only difference between the service recipients in this case, being First Nations children on reserve, is that they do not receive the same or similar child welfare. Otherwise they are the same in age and require child welfare and similar treatment. There is nothing in Gibbs, supra, suggesting two different service providers.\niv. The Complainants\u2019 Arguments that the Crown\u2019s Position Results in an Unacceptable Situation is not Consonant with the Clear Words of the CHRA\nThe Society advocates that the failure to hold a hearing, and ultimately determine that the CHRA does not provide relief to First Nations children in this case has unacceptable consequences. Effectively, First Nations children are deprived of the protection of the CHRA, which is tantamount to approving a separate but equal racial discrimination construct akin to the situation in the United States leading to the ruling of Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka et al., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (U.S. Sup. Ct.1954). The Ont. Chiefs refer to the government\u2019s repeal of s. 67 of the CHRA that formerly prevented the Tribunal from hearing cases that arose under the auspices of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. The Ont. Chiefs argue that, in spite of the repeal of s.67 of the CHRA, INAC would be more or less immune from the CHRA. The complainant group argues that Parliament has deliberately repealed s. 67 of the Act to divide and conquer First Nations persons.\nIn addressing this argument, I observe that the issue of Parliament\u2019s intention in repealing s. 67 of the Act is not directly before me in deciding this motion. The repeal of s. 67 of the CHRA provides a quasi-judicial \/ judicial obligation upon First Nations vis-\u00e0-vis their members to comply with the Act. The practical result of the amendment will be to encourage division amongst the First Nation executive and its members. From a contextual perspective, as it relates to this case, I observe that the repeal, on its face, requires the Federal government and First Nations, as with other federally regulated public and private sector service providers and employers, to adhere to the CHRA. The two results are that: federal government departments may not discriminate against First Nations persons on prescribed grounds when providing services to Aboriginal persons. For example, the government may not offer services to First Nations members and discriminate against disabled First Nations members, or female First Nations members. Concurrently, First Nations may not discriminate against First Nations members when providing services to members in their individual Nations. For example, First Nations may not offer services to its members and discriminate against disabled persons or women within the Nation. Far from exempting either the First Nations or the government, including INAC, from liability under the Act, the repeal of s. 67 places liability upon both of these potential respondents.\nI agree that the repeal of s. 67 of the CHRA contemplates that new types of cases may now become the subject of adjudication before this Tribunal. These cases may well be anticipated to be complex and of great consequence to entire communities of First Nations Canadians. They will stretch the imagination of the Tribunal to manage them in an appropriate and culturally sensitive manner. Each such case will have to be determined on its merits on a case by case basis. The fact that there is no relief in the circumstances of this complaint, does not equate to the fact that other complaints may not be made out. While, it may well be true, that in the circumstances of this case, a complaint of discrimination cannot be made out against INAC, and that this result may well be disconcerting to the First Nations communities; however, the CHRA cannot be interpreted using a results based analysis. It is the words of the CHRA that must govern the ambit of both the complaint and the remedy. Unfortunately, if the CHRA provides no remedy in this case, then the remedy may lie elsewhere (e.g.: a constitutional challenge to the Act, or seeking political redress).\nWhile I am alive to the ramifications of the above analysis for on-reserve First Nations children, for the reasons set out above, not only is the expansion of the comparator analysis illogical, it is also potentially self-defeating for First Nations themselves. Also, AFN suggested that the Tribunal should compare on-reserve First Nations children who are receiving child welfare through the federal government scheme with on-reserve First Nations children who are receiving child welfare through the provincial system. However, section 5(b) of the Act requires that any differential treatment be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. This alternative argument fails to identify such a ground. As well, it again is grounded in comparing two different service providers.\nGiven my finding on the comparator issue it is not necessary to address the Crown\u2019s argument regarding residency. Nor is there any need to address the issue of remedy in relation to Jordan\u2019s principle.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nAlthough I cannot decide the services issue in this motion on the basis of the current evidentiary record, I can decide the legal issue of the comparator group. For the reasons given above, the Crown\u2019s motion is granted on this comparator issue. I find that the complaint does not come within the provisions of section 5(b) of the Act. Therefore, the complaint is dismissed.\n",

Lustig\nDate: March 16, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 5\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a motion by the Respondent dated January 19, 2011 for an adjournment of the proceedings in this matter pending the outcome of its application to the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requesting the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[2] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant on September 11, 2006. The complaint alleges that the Respondent, between June, 2006 and August 25, 2006, discriminated against her, on the grounds of sex, in relation to her employment, by failing to hire her for a foreman position, notwithstanding she had the skills of the male workers hired and more experience than they did. The Complainant is a stevedore who works with the Respondent loading and unloading cruise ships in the Vancouver harbour.\n[3] On July 29, 2010, the Commission, pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d) requested the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[4] On August 30, 2010, the Respondent filed its Notice of Application for judicial review in Federal Court in File No. T-1388-10.\n[5] On January 10, 2011, the Respondent also filed a motion with the Federal Court seeking an Order expediting the hearing of its judicial review application.\n[6] On January 27, 2011, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the motion for an expedited hearing and setting the date for the hearing of the application for judicial review on Tuesday, March 15, 2011 and Wednesday, March 16, 2011. In its decision the Federal Court stated as follows:\nThe Applicant has not discharged its burden of demonstrating that the circumstances in this case are exceptional such as to warrant an expedited hearing. Further, the motion has also been rendered redundant by Order dated January 14, 2011 granting the Applicant leave to requisition a hearing date immediately. Nonetheless, I conclude that hearing dates should be fixed immediately to allow the Applicant to request an abeyance of proceedings from the Tribunal based on the imminent hearing before this Court, if so advised.\n[7] On December 16, 2010, the Tribunal requested the parties to indicate whether they wished to participate in evaluative mediation. All of the parties indicated an interest in participating in such a process subject, in the case of the Respondent, to a condition that the Tribunal issue a non-binding opinion to the parties. No dates have been set for the mediation and no dates have been set for pleadings, disclosure or a hearing in this matter.\n[8] The parties filed with the Tribunal submissions with respect to the Respondent\u2019s motion for an adjournment.\n[9] The essence of the Respondent\u2019s submissions, in support of its motion, is that it is unreasonable to proceed with the Tribunal process when the judicial review application is so near to resolution. Without an adjournment, if the judicial review application is successful, there will be a needless expenditure of public and private resources occasioned by two concurrent proceedings. If the application for judicial review is unsuccessful, the length of delay that can reasonably be expected to occur from an adjournment would be relatively short and would not prejudice the parties.\n[10] The essence of the submissions of both the Complainant and the Commission, in opposition to the motion for an adjournment, is that there is nothing yet to adjourn. Further, that even with hearing dates set for the judicial review application before the Federal Court, the ultimate timing and outcome of that process is unknown. As such, there is no justification for the Respondent\u2019s request based upon cases decided by the Tribunal in similar situations, on the basis of a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice, or a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representation if an adjournment is not granted.\n[11] According to section 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railways [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para 17). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n[12] In spite of the fact that dates have now been set for the hearing of the application for judicial review, there is no certainty with respect to either the timing or the eventual outcome of that process. In order for the Respondent to obtain an adjournment, it must establish that allowing the proceedings before the Tribunal to follow their normal course will result in a denial to the Respondent of natural justice. The Respondent has not persuaded me that any such prejudice would necessarily result if an adjournment were not granted.\n[13] The Respondent\u2019s motion is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

By the end of the second week, the complainant had testified for approximately 9 days. The case subsequently adjourned for a few months to give the respondent time to resolve a technical issue relating to videotape evidence.\n[2] On March 9, 2010, the Respondent in this case brought a motion for an order that the presiding member recuse himself on the basis that a reasonable apprehension of bias has arisen. The grounds put forward in support of the bias allegation included the following:\n(i) That the presiding member had, through his comments, rulings and conduct in the course of the hearing, raised a reasonable apprehension of bias;\n(ii) That the presiding member had, by imposing restrictions on the cross-examination of the complainant, prejudiced the respondent\u2019s case. Furthermore, the imposition of such restrictions had given rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[3] The complainant and the Commission opposed the motion, and oral arguments on the motion were heard on October 13, 2010.\n[4] After having given careful consideration to the evidence, authorities and arguments presented by the parties in this motion, I have decided that the motion must be dismissed. I believe that my conduct during this hearing was judicial, impartial and conducive to all parties being given a full and ample opportunity to be heard. Indeed, prior to the bringing of the recusal motion, I remained ready to continue on with the hearing of the respondent\u2019s case and committed to hearing its evidence and argument with an open mind.\n[5] However, I am mindful of the fact that my mere denial of the recusal motion would not be the end of the matter, and that further delays would most likely be incurred in this case as the respondent would inevitably pursue judicial review of my ruling in the Federal Court. Depending on the Court\u2019s judgment, an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal would be also quite possible.\n[6] For this reason, I am hereby informing the parties that I will resign from this case, as of the day after this ruling, and that I will ask the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to assign another member or panel to inquire into the complaint. Based on all of the circumstances of the case, I feel that such action is in the best interests of justice. In particular, it may provide an opportunity for the parties to reconsider some kind of alternative means of resolving their dispute, or at the very least, narrow the issues in dispute before a new decision-maker or decision-makers, to be assigned by the Tribunal Chairperson.\n[7] The respondent\u2019s motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 28, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1342\/7208\nStyle of Cause: Fallan Davis v.

Leave and attendance records Attridge, Chase, Chen, Coultis, Fleury, Godin, Knowles, Noah, Noyle, Rodgers 2005 through to current date;\nb.

Un-redacted copy email from Bill Woods 2010\/01\/03 to Tania Maidment.\u201d\n[2] On May 24, 2006, Elizabeth Cannon filed Complaints with the Commission, on behalf of a group of employees of the Respondent, alleging that the Respondent had failed to accommodate the Complainants in respect of their work arrangements, on the basis of family status, sex and disability, prohibited grounds of discrimination under s. 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u2019), by cancelling between September, 2005 and January, 2006, a program providing these employees with the opportunity either to work from home (\u201cTeleworking\u201d) or from a government office other than their assigned office (\u201cHotelling\u201d). The Complainants allege that they have requested accommodation as they are primary caregivers and that their circumstances are such that they commute to work on a daily basis which is alleged is detrimental to their family life.\n[3] The Commission referred the Complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) for an inquiry on July 31, 2009 pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the CHRA.\n[4] Pursuant to its correspondence with the parties on January 25, 2011 and a subsequent teleconference with the parties, the Respondent agreed to disclose to the parties the documents listed in subparagraphs 1 (a), (b) and (c) of this Ruling, to the extent that such documents exist and remain in the Respondent\u2019s possession or control, subject to any claim for privilege that the Respondent may have in respect of these documents.\n[5] On the basis of the foregoing, the Respondent has stated at paragraph 20 of its February 15, 2011 submissions that the only documents that now need to be ruled on by the Tribunal regarding their disclosure are those listed in subparagraphs 1 (d) and (e) of this Ruling.\n[6] For certainty, the Tribunal hereby rules that the Respondent must disclose to the parties the documents requested by the Applicants in this motion, listed in subparagraphs 1 (a), (b) and (c) of this Ruling forthwith.\n[7] The parties have all made submissions respecting the request for disclosure in this motion.\n[8] The essence of the Applicants\u2019 submissions with respect to disclosure by the Respondent of the documents listed in subparagraphs 1 (d) and (e) of this Ruling is as follows:\n\u201cWith regard to our request for current reporting structure charts; this information is paramount to our case as the Respondent has stated in all of their correspondence to the Complainants, that all telework and hotelling had ceased in 2005. While we can readily see that is not the case. We require the requested documentation as proof that the Respondent provides such workplace accommodation to other groups of employees; yet will not supply this accommodation when requested on the grounds of family status.\nWith regard to our request for an un-redacted copy of the email between Bill Woods and Tania Maidment of 2010\/01\/03, we would offer the following:\n(a) of late, the Respondent has claimed this email is a privileged solicitor\/client communication; however, it should be noted here that the Respondent had ample opportunity to provide that specific information to the Complainants CHRC legal and the Tribunal when the document was originally requested in April, 2010.\n(b) the document in question was not prepared by legal counsel and therefore, cannot attract a solicitor-client privilege. Of particular importance is the fact that this document was not created for the dominant purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aid to the conduct of litigation and therefore should be part of the disclosure process.\u201d\n[9] The essence of the Respondent\u2019s submissions with respect to the request for disclosure of the documents listed in subparagraphs 1 (d) and (e) is as follows:\n\u201cThe documents referred to in subparagraph 1 (d), herein, are in respect of other sections of offices within HRSDC and do not include information with respect to teleworking and hotelling. The documents are therefore irrelevant to the issue of whether HRSDC has discriminated against the Complainants on the ground of family status. Even if the documents did broach the use of telework and hotelling in other sections or offices within HRSDC, they would still be irrelevent to the within proceedings and in particular, to whether the Complainants\u2019 individual circumstances give rise to a legitimate claim of discrimination on the prohibited ground of \u201cfamily status\u201d.\nThe document referred in subparagraph 1 (e), herein, constitutes a communication to counsel by the HRSDC official charged with responding to the Complainants\u2019 accommodation request. The communication occurred during the period when HRSDC was assessing how to respond to these requests, in the context of ongoing litigation before the Tribunal. HRSDC properly claimed the protection of solicitor-client privilege in respect of this communication.\u201d\nThe Respondent cited various authorities in support of its submissions respecting solicitor \/client privilege and litigation privilege. On March 20, 2011 the Respondent filed corrected materials respecting the correspondence listed in subparagraph 1 (e) of this Ruling which clarifies that it was sent to the Respondent\u2019s counsel in the course of this litigation.\n[10] The essence of the Commission\u2019s submissions with respect to the request for disclosure of the documents listed in subparagraphs 1 (d) and (e) of this Ruling is as follows:\n\u201cRule 6 (1) e of the Rules of Procedure of the CHRT is relevant in respect to the issue of disclosure:\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\nIn the Ruling on disclosure in Connie Bushey v. Arvind Sharma 2003 CHRT 5, the Tribunal set out the guiding principle regarding disclosure:\n(4) The Respondent has taken issue with the fact that a copy of the minutes of settlement with the unions has not been disclosed to him. Although the Respondent is not represented by legal counsel and is acting on his own behalf, I understand him to be contending that he is entitled to have this document communicated to him, in accordance with Rule 6 (3) of the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Rules of Procedure. This rule, when read together with Rule 6 (1) (d), obliges a party to provide to other parties, copies of all documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which no privilege is claimed. The test for relevance for these purposes has been expressed as being whether the document in question is \u201carguably relevant\u201d to the hearing. (1)\u2019\nIn other words, if the materials being sought are arguably relevant to the facts in issue, the liability issue or the issue of damages, the materials should be disclosed.\nThe Complainants are also challenging the identification of a document identified as solicitor-client privileged.\u201d\nThe Commission did not express an opinion with respect to the document identified as solicitor\/client privileged.\n[11] While the documents referred to in paragraph 1 (d) do not appear, according to their description, to be anything more than an organization-type chart, the fact that the Applicants have requested disclosure of these documents leads me to believe that they may also include information that is relevant to the case. As such, I agree with the submissions of the Commission and the Applicants, referred to herein, that they are arguably relevant and therefore rule that disclosure of these documents must be provided to the parties by the Respondent forthwith.\n[12] With the further information about the document in subparagraph 1 (e) provided by the Respondent on March 15, it is clear to me that this documentation did get sent to counsel for the Respondent and was intended to be used by the Respondent in this litigation. As such, I accept the submissions of the Respondent with respect to this document and rule that it need not be disclosed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

The Complaint [1] This is a decision regarding a complaint made by Mr. Joselito Silva, the Complainant, against Canada Post Corporation (\u201cCanada Post\u201d), the Respondent. In his Complaint, filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) on January 6, 2008, the Complainant alleged that in June of 2007 the Respondent, as his employer, discriminated against him in the course of his employment, by differentiating adversely on the basis of family status, contrary to s. 7 (b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). In particular, the Complainant alleged that he was refused a promotion by the Respondent to a supervisory position that he was qualified for, on account of two previous grievances that were successfully taken against the Respondent by two of his sisters who are also employees of the Respondent.\n[2] The inquiry by this Tribunal into the Complaint was requested by the Commission as being warranted pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the Act by a letter dated December 23, 2009.\n[3] The Commission did not appear at the Hearing of this Complaint by the Tribunal.\nII. Findings of Fact [4] The Complainant began his employment with the Respondent at its Calgary mail processing plant in 1998 as a Christmas casual employee. He subsequently became a temporary employee and ultimately, in 2002, became a permanent employee with the Respondent, where he currently works as a unionized full-time Postal Clerk at the plant. Mr. Greg Beauchamp of the Respondent\u2019s Human Resources Department hired the Complainant.\n[5] The Complainant came to Canada in 1987 from the Philippines where he was educated and obtained a degree in Civil Engineering from the Technological Institute of the Philippines in 1986. Prior to working for the Respondent, he had several jobs including jobs with Nortel Networks and Stanley Associates Engineering. He has taken various self-improvement courses since coming to Canada. He has been involved, as well, in various volunteer efforts in his community. Over the years, he has provided support to various family members in addition to his immediate family.\n[6] In 2004, the Complainant attended the Canada Post Career Leadership Development Program (\u201cCLDP\u201d). The CLDP is a leadership program for internal Canada Post employees. It is a three day program that is offered from time to time. Applicants apply for participation in the program with the support of their supervisor. The program is run by a facilitator and a number (usually 5) of the Respondent\u2019s managers from various departments who act as assessors, observing the participants during the program and assessing their performance in the tasks completed. The program requires the participants to perform tasks in groups, to make presentations and to engage in problem solving.\n[7] After his participation in the 2004 CLDP, the assessors concluded, through their observations of him at the CLDP, that the Complainant would not be put forward for a supervisory position. The Complainant was provided with feedback on his performance at the CLDP by three of the assessors who were in attendance at the program, including Mr. Greg Beauchamp of the Employee Relations Department. During the feedback session with the assessors, the Complainant advised them that he had interests in being involved in engineering technology. It was suggested to him that he should contact the Manager of Operations Improvement to further his interests in the area of engineering technology if that was his real preference rather than becoming a supervisor in his area. The Complainant was also provided with feedback on his communication skills and his proficiency in English. He was advised that in both of these areas he would need improvement in order to be a supervisor of other employees, with tasks including holding meetings to direct them.\n[8] Ms. Magdalena Silva is the Complainant\u2019s sister. She was provided with an offer of employment letter from the Respondent in November of 2005 despite the fact that she had failed the GAT (General Abilities Test) and, as a result of her score, would not have met the criteria for an offer of employment with the Respondent. When this error was discovered by the Respondent the offer was withdrawn. Mr. Beauchamp wrote a letter dated November 18, 2005 to Ms. Silva terminating her employment. Ms. Silva grieved the withdrawal of the offer and the matter was settled prior to arbitration with Ms. Silva being hired as a permanent employee in June, 2006 with a continuous service date of November, 2005.\n[9] Ms. Rosalyn Trudel is also the Complainant\u2019s sister. Ms. Trudel was hired in November, 2005 for Christmas coverage and was provided with a work schedule. When her personal information was entered into the Respondent\u2019s personnel computer system, a number of discrepancies were discovered related to her married name (Trudel) and her maiden name (Silva). When this information was discovered, the Respondent terminated Ms. Trudel\u2019s employment. This occurred a few days prior to the date that she was scheduled to report for her first shift. Mr. Beauchamp wrote a letter dated November 10, 2005 to Ms. Trudel confirming her temporary employment with the Respondent then wrote a letter dated November 24, 2005 to Ms. Trudel terminating her employment. She grieved the withdrawal of the offer of employment and the termination. An arbitration decision was rendered in her favour. Ms. Trudel was reinstated with a continuous service date of employment with the Respondent of November, 2005.\n[10] After hearing from his sister, Rosalyn Trudel, on November 24, 2005, after she received her termination letter, the Complainant phoned Mr. Beauchamp on November 25, 2005 to enquire about his sister\u2019s termination. Mr. Beauchamp refused to provide the Complainant with the information on the basis that it was privileged and private personal information that he was not permitted to disclose to the Complainant under privacy policies and legislation. The Complainant was agitated and upset during this call.\n[11] From 2006 and during the time frame of the Complainant\u2019s Complaint of June 2007, the Respondent undertook a program to significantly increase the number of supervisors at its facilities across Canada. In order to be able to handle the increased work load for this procurement undertaking, the Respondent engaged a third party service provider Spherion Corporation (\u201cSpherion\u201d) to assist with its national recruitment program of supervisors. Both internal and external candidates could apply directly to Spherion for consideration for placement in supervisor training.\n[12] In January of 2006, the Complainant again applied for a supervisory position in his area of work with the Respondent. His application was not put forward for further consideration as there had been no changes in his resume since his last application in 2004.\n[13] Later in 2006, the Complainant applied for another supervisory position through Spherion. Through the application process involving both on-line testing and a personal interview, the Complainant did not meet the minimum benchmark score of 70 percent required to move forward in that process.\n[14] Again in June of 2007, the Complainant applied for a supervisory position with the Respondent through Spherion. He dealt with Ms. Leanne Nichol of Spherion during this process.\n[15] The Spherion recruitment process includes a pre-screen telephone questionnaire, online testing (typing, computer literacy, personality and language proficiency), in person behavioural interview and written assessment, reference verification followed by a second interview by the Respondent, if warranted by a successful minimum benchmark score of 70 percent through the Spherion process.\n[16] Prospective candidates were brought to Ms. Nichol\u2019s attention through a few different avenues. Either they would apply directly to Spherion through a public job board where an advertisement was posted, or their name might be brought forward through Spherion\u2019s temporary division, or they may have been referred directly to Spherion from the Respondent. From time to time, the Respondent\u2019s contact, Diana Cheys, of the Human Resources Department or another of the Respondent\u2019s supervisors would refer an internal candidate of the Respondent to Ms. Nichol and provide her with the candidate\u2019s resume directly. Regardless of how the candidate\u2019s application came to her, the candidate would complete the same process and testing with Spherion.\n[17] In 2007, the Complainant applied to Spherion directly in response to a posting on the public job board. Unless they were advised by the Complainant himself, neither Ms. Cheys nor anyone else affiliated with the Respondent would have been aware of the Complainant\u2019s application through the public job board because Spherion did not report the names of the applicants to the Respondent at the application stage.\n[18] The Spherion online testing is conducted through secured programs known as Proveit and Prevue Systems, which are designed to be unbiased to any candidate conducting the tests. They are assigned through the staffing agency and are inaccessible to the Respondent or any other organization. The organizations Spherion recruits for (in this case the Respondent) identifies the types of tests and assessments to be completed by the applicants for the position being recruited. Once a candidate has completed a test, Ms. Nichol would receive notification from Spherion\u2019s corporate office in order to access the results. These programs are utilized throughout various staffing agencies and recruits outside of the front line supervisor recruit with the Respondent. For the Respondent\u2019s recruitment program, it was Ms. Nichol\u2019s role to administer the tests, assessments and an interview and endorse any candidates who scored benchmarks of 70 percent and higher for further consideration through a subsequent interview with the Respondent.\n[19] Ms. Nichol first came into contact with the Complainant as part of his application to Spherion in June, 2007, when the Complainant applied for a front line supervisor role with the Respondent. Ms. Nichol had no knowledge of any of the Complainant\u2019s previous applications or results from any prior applications and candidacy assessments. On June 6, 2007, the Complainant completed the online behavioural assessment, which rated the Complainant at 66 percent. The Complainant scored average percentiles on his software testing which was also conducted on June 6. The Complainant\u2019s online assessments were only a portion of the process and not enough to excuse the Complainant from the entire recruit; therefore Ms. Nichol could not determine if the Complainant would be successful or not just based on the Complainant\u2019s online assessments. Ms. Nichol required an in person interview to determine the Complainant\u2019s overall potential for the position and left voicemails to the Complainant requesting an in person interview immediately following the online test. Her voicemails were very upbeat. The Complainant took from those voicemails the view that he would be successful though there was nothing said to that effect on the voicemails.\n[20] The Complainant had an in person interview with Ms. Nichol on June 7, 2007 and completed a written assessment at Spherion\u2019s office prior to the interview. It was Ms. Nichol\u2019s professional practice not to advise any candidate in an interview that they would be put forward to the Respondent for an interview, as this could not be determined until their entire assessment was scored. Subsequent to the Complainant\u2019s interview and written assessment, Ms. Nichol calculated the onsite assessments with the Complainant\u2019s online assessments.\n[21] The Complainant\u2019s score was below the required benchmark. Ms. Nichol\u2019s did her very best to find a valid scenario whereby she would be able to score the Complainant at the 70 percent benchmark level that was required by the Respondent before an applicant in the Spherion process could be recommended for the next step in the process, which was an interview with the Respondent, however, Ms. Nichol could not score the Complainant at this level, and thus he did not attain the minimum benchmark score of 70 percent. Ms. Nichol recalled the score being in the mid-60's. Ms. Cheys recalled being told a score of 66 percent by Ms. Nichol. The Respondent set a benchmark score in the Spherion process of 70 percent for all applicants. Ms. Nichol gave evidence that while she had, from time to time, attempted to encourage the Respondent to put forward applicants, including the Complainant, who scored close to the 70 percent benchmark, she was never successful in those attempts. She admitted that her firm got paid for recruiting successful applicants, however, the only candidates that moved forward were those with a 70 percent score.\n[22] The Respondent was advised by Ms. Nichol of the Complainant\u2019s application and unsuccessful assessment. Ms. Nichol expressed concern to Ms. Cheys regarding a language and communication barrier she felt the Complainant had. Ms. Cheys asked that Ms. Nichol provide recommendations to the Complainant for ESL (English as a Second Language) training to improve the Complainant\u2019s communications skills so that the Complainant may be successful with his applications for a supervisory position in the future. Ms. Nichol gave the Complainant recommendations for a number of ESL programs in Calgary that the Complainant might wish to investigate.\n[23] Although the Complainant received some positive feedback from the interview, the Complainant did not achieve the benchmark result of 70 percent in the overall assessment and was therefore not eligible to move forward in the process. The Complainant had the impression from his interview with Ms. Nichol that he would be moved forward to an interview with the Respondent. While the evidence was that Ms. Nichol spoke with Ms. Cheys and was hoping that, since the Complainant was close to the minimum benchmark, he might be \u201cput through\u201d, there was nothing ever done by Ms. Nichol to recommend that the minimum benchmark requirement be waived and nothing was ever said or written to the Complainant by Ms. Nichol or anyone else that he would receive an interview with the Respondent.\n[24] Other than the behavioural interview, a few brief telephone calls with the Complainant, and emails to the Complainant advising him that he was not moving forward in the process, Ms. Nichol did not have any other involvement with the Complainant regarding his application to the Respondent for a supervisory position.\n[25] At no time during the assessment process that Ms. Nichol conducted with the Complainant did she have any information on any concerns or issues regarding the Complainant\u2019s family members. As well, Ms. Nichol\u2019s uncontradicted evidence was that Mr. Daryl Pinto and Mr. Prakash John, who were candidates for supervisor at the same time as the Complainant, both scored above the minimum benchmark requirement contrary to the Complainant\u2019s belief in this regard.\n[26] Ms. Cheys gave evidence that she did not know any of the past history of the Complainant\u2019s sisters with the Respondent until after the evaluation was complete and a decision had been made on the Complainant\u2019s application. Ms. Cheys evidence was that the Complainant\u2019s Spherion application was not put forward because he did not attain the 70 percent benchmark, and this was a firm rule that she did not have any discretion to overrule. Ms. Cheys evidence was that she never at any time prevented the Complainant\u2019s application from moving forward based on any issues with his sisters. Ms. Cheys also confirmed the evidence given by Ms. Nichol that the Respondent had not moved forward any applicant who scored less than 70 percent as she had no discretion to do so.\n[27] After the Complainant was declined in June of 2007 through Spherion, he enlisted the support of his supervisor, Rick Watson, who had worked with him previously at Nortel. Mr. Watson sent a request to the Director, Tom Dixon, inquiring about the supervisor process. The inquiry was brought to the attention of Ms. Cheys, and she related this to Mr. Beauchamp. They decided to meet with the Complainant to explain to him why he had been unsuccessful in the competitive process for supervisor training.\n[28] This meeting was held on June 20, 2007. During the meeting Ms. Cheys and Mr. Beauchamp reviewed with the Complainant that one of the reasons why he was unsuccessful in the process was that his skills communicating in English needed to improve as this was very important to a supervisor\u2019s interactions with employees on the work floor.\n[29] During the meeting on June 20, 2007, Mr. Beauchamp reviewed with the Complainant concerns he had previously had with him in 2005 regarding his involvement in hiring decisions concerning the Complainant\u2019s sisters, Rosalyn Trudel and Magdalena Silva. The incident Mr. Beauchamp was referring the Complainant to, happened in November, 2005, when the Complainant telephoned Mr. Beauchamp demanding information about why his sisters had not been hired by the Respondent. Mr. Beauchamp advised the Complainant at that time that this was the personal information of his sisters and due to privacy laws, the Complainant was not entitled to the information, regardless of his relationship to them. During this November, 2005 conversation, the Complainant became quite agitated and repeatedly insisted on being provided with personal information about his family members.\n[30] During the June 20, 2007 meeting with the Complainant and Ms. Cheys, Mr. Beauchamp was using the reference to the Complainant\u2019s past behaviour in 2005 as an example of one of his skills gaps to illustrate that if this was how the Complainant behaved when it came to the Complainant\u2019s family members, how would the Complainant behave on the work floor if a similar situation came up. Would the Complainant inappropriately disclose personal information, or get agitated and insist on being provided with information that the Complainant was not entitled to? Supervisors are provided with access to confidential and personal information about the employees they are supervising and it was a concern to Mr. Beauchamp that the Complainant appreciate the demands placed on a supervisor when dealing with employees in difficult circumstances and that supervisors must be discrete and know how to use and protect confidential information and personal information. The Complainant took this reference by Mr. Beauchamp instead, as a clear sign that he was reminding the Complainant of the fact that his sisters had grieved their terminations in the past and that this was why he was not being promoted. It is my finding that the Complainant misunderstood this reference and that Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s intention was to use the reference as an example of one of the Complainant\u2019s skill deficiencies and not for any vindictive or discriminatory purpose.\n[31] With respect to the Complainant\u2019s applications through the Spherion process, Mr. Beauchamp had no involvement in Spherion\u2019s application or screening process. Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s only involvement with the Complainant\u2019s application in June, 2007 was by way of the meeting with Ms. Cheys and the Complainant on November 20, 2007. After 2005, Mr. Beauchamp had no dealings with Magdalena Silva or Rosalyn Trudel.\n[32] At the time of the Hearing, Ms. Nichol was no longer working for Spherion, Ms. Cheys was no longer working for the Respondent and Mr. Beauchamp had retired and was no longer working for the Respondent.\nIII. Law A. Establishing a Prima Facie case of discrimination [33] Section 7 of the Act states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nFamily status is a prohibited ground of discrimination under s. 3 of the Act.\n[34] The initial onus is upon the Complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a decision in favour of the Complainant, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s answer should not be considered in the determination of whether the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission) and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204.)\nB. Reversal of burden of proof and justification [35] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate by providing a reasonable (non-pretextual) explanation that the alleged discrimination either did not occur as alleged, or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory or justified. It is not necessary that the discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a Complainant to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer\u2019s actions or decisions. (Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48, paras. 4-5; CHRA, s. 15). See also Canada v. Lambie 1996 CanLII 3940 (F.C.).\nIV. Issues [36] There are two issues that need to be determined in this case:\n(1) Has the Complainant demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status?\n(2) Has the Respondent provided a reasonable explanation that is not a pretext for discrimination?\nV. Analysis\/Conclusions [37] The Complainant\u2019s case at the hearing consisted of the testimony of his two sisters Magdalena Silva and Rosalyn Trudel as well as his own testimony. In addition, he produced various documents as exhibits.\n[38] While Ms. Silva\u2019s and Ms. Trudel\u2019s evidence confirmed their terminations, grievances and reinstatements as referred to above, neither of them provided any evidence supporting the Complainant\u2019s allegation that his failure to obtain a promotion to supervisor through the Spherion process in June of 2007 was in any way related to them or their earlier grievances.\n[39] The Complainant\u2019s evidence did not establish that he had been successful in the Spherion process warranting an interview by the Respondent. In fact, he produced documentation, in the form of copies of the summaries of the testing phase of the process that indicated that his score was 66 percent which was below the benchmark threshold of 70 percent required to succeed. He did not produce any evidence that indicated that other candidates had been hired as a supervisor with an overall score below 70 percent.\n[40] The Complainant had the impression from his conversation and e-mails with Ms. Nicol on June 6, 2007 that he had done well enough on the interview with her to bring his overall assessment above the 70 percent mark, however, he admitted in cross-examination that neither Ms. Nicol nor anyone else actually told him or wrote to him that he had passed and would be interviewed by the Respondent. He acknowledged that he had been advised by Ms. Nichol that he lacked certain skills necessary to advance and required further training in these areas.\n[41] The Complainant\u2019s evidence did not vary from Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s evidence in any material way respecting their conversation of November 25, 2005 regarding his sisters\u2019 terminations. The Complainant was upset about the terminations and called Mr. Beauchamp who refused to discuss the matter on the basis of the need for the protection of his sisters\u2019 privacy.\n[42] The Complainant had the impression that Ms. Cheys and Mr. Beauchamp had negatively influenced the outcome of his application through Spherion in June of 2007 because of the earlier grievances by his sisters. He did not, however, produce any evidence to confirm the validity of his impression in this regard. He admitted, in cross-examination, that neither Ms. Cheys nor Mr. Beauchamp had been involved in the Spherion process except to the extent of the discussion that took place between Ms. Nicol and Ms. Cheys after the testing and behavioural assessment by Ms. Nicol had been concluded. He did not produce any evidence that Ms. Nicol had recommended him for an interview with Ms. Cheys on the basis that he had achieved the minimum benchmark of 70 percent.\n[43] Ms. Cheys knew nothing of the past grievances by his sisters until she met with the Complainant and Mr. Beauchamp after the Complainant had been made aware that his application was unsuccessful. Her evidence was very clear that she never waived the 70 percent benchmark requirement for any candidate to succeed\n[44] Neither Ms. Cheys nor Mr. Beauchamp were involved in the June, 2007 supervisor application process of the Complainant until after the Complainant had failed to achieve the required benchmark through the Spherion testing and interview process when they met with him on June 20, 2007. During this meeting they tried to help explain to the Complainant why he had not succeeded in the process and to encourage him to address his deficiencies.\n[45] On the basis of the foregoing facts, I find that the Complainant has failed to make out a prima facie case and that the Respondent has provided a full and reasonable (non-pre-textual) explanation for the alleged discrimination.\n[46] As such, the Complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Cerescorp Company\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2011-07-07\nNeutral citation\n2011 CHRT 9\nFile number(s)\nT1491\/3710\nDecision type\nRuling\nGrounds\nSex\nDecision Content\nBetween:\nLinda Marshall\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nCerescorp Company\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember: Susheel Gupta\nDate: July 7, 2011\nCitation: 2011 CHRT 9\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a motion by the Complainant dated June 10, 2011 for an adjournment of a hearing in this matter pending the outcome of an investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) into possible systemic discrimination by the Respondent.\n[2] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant on September 11, 2006. The complaint alleges that the Respondent, between June 2006 and August 25, 2006, discriminated against her, on the grounds of sex, in relation to her employment, by failing to hire her for a foreman position, notwithstanding she had the skills of the male workers hired and more experience than they did. The complaint further alleges discrimination, on the grounds of sex, that she was subject to adverse differential treatment. The Complainant is a stevedore who works with the Respondent loading and unloading cruise ships in the Vancouver harbour.\n[3] On July 29, 2010, the Commission, pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d) requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the complaint. The Commission also requested that the Tribunal conduct an inquiry, based on the Commission\u2019s investigation, into possible systemic discrimination by the Respondent.\n[4] On August 30, 2010, the Respondent filed its Notice of Application for judicial review in Federal Court in File No. T-1388-10. The hearing of the Application for judicial review was heard on March 15, 2011.\n[5] The Federal Court issued its decision on April 15, 2011. Russell J., in his decision, found that the Complainant did not possess all of the posted qualifications for the foreperson position. At paragraph 67, Russell J. stated:\nTo have overlooked this was a fundamental mistake of fact on the part of the Investigator which renders the Decision to refer the complaint to a tribunal on the basis of denial of promotion unreasonable.\n[6] As such, the Federal Court set aside this portion of the complaint and the July 27, 2010 decision of the Commission referring the complaint except as follows, and I quote from the Russell\u2019s J. judgment:\n2. The Decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated 27 July 2010 is set aside except as follows:\na. The issue of \u201cThwarted in Efforts to get Floater Experience\u201d as identified in paragraphs 102-107 of the Investigator\u2019s Report; and\nb. The issue of \u201cSingled out for Scrutiny More Than Male Employees,\u201d as identified in paragraphs 108-115 of the Investigator\u2019s Report\ncan, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceed to the chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to institute an inquiry into these two aspects of the Complaint alone;\n3. The aspect of the Decision that deals with possible systemic discrimination against women in the promotion process is remitted to the Commission for investigation by a different investigator acting in a procedurally fair manner and subsequent re-determination by the Commission; \u2026\n[7] The Tribunal wrote to the parties on June 3, 2011 requesting written submissions on the issue of how to proceed with this matter.\n[8] Subsequently, the parties filed written submissions with respect to the Complainant\u2019s adjournment request.\n[9] The crux of the Respondent\u2019s submission, in opposition to the adjournment request, is that the Federal Court was clear in that the two aforementioned issues proceed to an Inquiry alone while the systemic discrimination complaint is referred back to the Commission for a new investigation. Further, that the remaining allegations are isolated instances not dependent upon the new investigation and a possible referral of a complaint into systemic discrimination.\n[10] The crux of the Complainant\u2019s submission is that they will suffer prejudice without the evidence of the Commission\u2019s investigation into systemic discrimination. Further, that hearing the \u201ctwo\u201c complaints separately would be contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s goals of expeditiously adjudicating upon human rights complaints as this would result in the holding of \u201ctwo\u201c hearings requiring the repetition of evidence, the additional costs of two hearings and the possible inconsistency of results.\n[11] According to section 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. As master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railways [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para 17).\n[12] Currently, there are only two issues comprising the complaint before the Tribunal. That there will be a further complaint referred by the Commission emanating from their investigation into systemic discrimination is speculative at this point in time. It is also possible that the Commission will not find that there is a practice of systemic discrimination emanating from their new investigation.\n[13] The ultimate length of time and outcome for the Commission to complete its further investigation is unknown at this time. The Commission states in their submission dated June 10, 2011, at page 2:\nI am not able to make any predictions at this time about the length of time that it may take for a fresh investigator to conduct an investigation, or for the Commission to make its subsequent re-determination.\n[14] It took several years from the filing of the initial and updated complaint to the date when the complaint arrived at the Tribunal for an inquiry. Any further such delay would be counter to section 48.9 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[15] The Federal Court in its decision did not direct that the portions of the referral it upheld should be stayed pending the outcome of the Commission\u2019s new investigation. The Federal Court indicated that the two allegations in the complaint can proceed forward to an Inquiry under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[16] In order for the Complainant to succeed on its Motion for an adjournment request, the Complainant must establish that allowing the Tribunal to proceed with hearings would result in a denial of natural justice.\n[17] I find that the Complainant has not established that she would suffer prejudice and a denial of natural justice if the adjournment were not granted.\n[18] The Complainant\u2019s motion is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 7, 2011\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1491\/3710\nStyle of Cause: Linda Marshall v.

Une autre question importante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle des r\u00e9percussions de la requ\u00eate sur le d\u00e9roulement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019instruction.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se r\u00e9sume comme suit :\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son t\u00e9moin additionnel vise directement un aspect important de l\u2019affaire, soit le mauvais rendement de la plaignante, et que la preuve est donc pertinente. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle d\u00e9posera des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve prouvant que la mise \u00e0 pied de la plaignante d\u00e9coulait d\u2019une comparaison l\u00e9gitime des deux repr\u00e9sentants r\u00e9gionaux de soutien des comptes \u00e0 Brandon effectu\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective. Le r\u00e9sultat de cette analyse a permis de conclure que les habilet\u00e9s, les capacit\u00e9s, le rendement et les qualifications de la plaignante \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux de l\u2019autre employ\u00e9 et qu\u2019il y avait une diff\u00e9rence notable sur le plan du rendement entre les deux employ\u00e9s qui ont fait l\u2019objet de la comparaison.\n[3] Dans ses arguments, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ses t\u00e9moins qui figurent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur la liste de l\u2019audience ont effectu\u00e9 une comparaison l\u00e9gitime des employ\u00e9s et ont appris que la plaignante avait tendance \u00e0 ne pas s\u2019entendre avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs, y compris les gestionnaires de comptes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite appeler son nouveau t\u00e9moin en r\u00e9action au t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, dans lequel elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019entendait bien \u00bb avec ses gestionnaires de comptes et dans lequel elle a contest\u00e9 la description faite dans ses \u00e9valuations de rendement de 2003 et de 2004 de la tendance de son rendement.\n[4] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que des preuves seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position selon laquelle l\u2019un des aspects du mauvais rendement de la plaignante \u00e9tait son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019entendre avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs, y compris ses gestionnaires de comptes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait aussi valoir que, comme sa position se fonde sur les arguments pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le t\u00e9moignage du gestionnaire de comptes aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et prouvera le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019argument selon lequel la plaignante ne s\u2019entendait pas avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs.\n[5] Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, sans le t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin additionnel, le Tribunal n\u2019aura pour preuve que les \u00e9valuations de rendement, le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et celui de son superviseur qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, t\u00e9moignera que les \u00e9valuations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies de fa\u00e7on honn\u00eate et que la plaignante s\u2019entendait bien avec le t\u00e9moin additionnel.\nAnalyse\n[6] La question porte sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante au sujet d\u2019une d\u00e9claration qu\u2019elle a faite \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins quant au fait qu\u2019elle s\u2019entendait bien avec les autres, y compris le t\u00e9moin additionnel que l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite appeler. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a contre-interrog\u00e9 la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vu prouver que la plaignante avait tendance \u00e0 ne pas s\u2019entendre avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs, y compris les gestionnaires de comptes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait facilement pu anticiper l\u2019argument ou le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait bel et bien anticip\u00e9 et a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante le 28 octobre, avant que l\u2019audience d\u00e9bute le 1er novembre. La lettre mentionnait que, si la plaignante contestait le contenu des \u00e9valuations de rendement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9senterait une demande au Tribunal pour appeler de nouveaux t\u00e9moins \u00e0 la barre. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter ses preuves par les t\u00e9moins qui figurent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur la liste. \u00c0 l\u2019exception du commentaire au sujet du fait que le Tribunal n\u2019aura pour preuve pour trancher la question que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, les \u00e9valuations de rendement et le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un gestionnaire qui pourrait \u00eatre d\u2019accord avec la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019explique pas pourquoi les autres t\u00e9moins qui se pr\u00e9senteront devant le Tribunal ne peuvent pas t\u00e9moigner au sujet de ce point. De plus, m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un aspect de la question en litige, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait pr\u00e9judice si la preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un nouveau t\u00e9moin. Le pr\u00e9judice que subirait le d\u00e9roulement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019instruction l\u2019emporte sur le pr\u00e9judice possible que pourrait subir l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[7] La plaignante-t\u00e9moin a termin\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage et n\u2019est plus sous serment. Je note les efforts que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour d\u00e9tailler le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 et pour pr\u00e9ciser les questions lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajout d\u2019un seul des deux gestionnaires de comptes, mais je ne souhaite pas retarder encore plus l\u2019audience, ce que je devrais faire si je devais accueillir une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante ou en ajout d\u2019un autre t\u00e9moin.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura amplement l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve et de contre-interroger le reste des t\u00e9moins de la plaignante.\n[9] Le t\u00e9moin additionnel que l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite appeler n\u2019est pas disponible lors des dates d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues et cela augmenterait le retard dans la tenue de l\u2019audience.\n[10] Le Tribunal a le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuer le poids appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la preuve de la plaignante en fonction de toute la preuve. Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante que j\u2019ai entendu et compte tenu des questions substantielles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est essentiel d\u2019entendre un autre t\u00e9moin.\n[11] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en vertu des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, de permettre, si n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019ajout de t\u00e9moins une fois l\u2019audience d\u00e9but\u00e9e, mais il doit utiliser ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en fonction d\u2019autres facteurs.

Introduction [1] Il s\u2019agit de la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019instruction des plaintes des pilotes George Vilven et Robert Kelly, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), selon lesquelles ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire, soit l\u2019obligation de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective sign\u00e9e par l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (l\u2019APAC) et Air Canada.\n[2] \u00c0 la date de son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, le 1er septembre 2003, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, M. Vilven \u00e9tait premier officier d\u2019Airbus 340. M. Kelly a pris sa retraite le 30 avril 2005, le jour de son soixanti\u00e8me anniversaire. Au moment de son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, M. Kelly \u00e9tait pilote commandant de bord d\u2019un Airbus 340.\n[3] La premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en ao\u00fbt 2007 et elle rejetait les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. En contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e en partie et l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision au sujet de la question portant sur la Charte et, si n\u00e9cessaire, au sujet de la question de savoir si les dispositions sur la retraite obligatoire constituaient une exigence op\u00e9rationnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP.\n[4] La deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 (2009 TCDP 24). Le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par un jugement rendu par la juge Mactavish, le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2011, dans lequel elle ordonnait, entre autres :\n3. La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019Air Canada est accord\u00e9e en partie, en rapport avec la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle Air Canada n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e pour ses pilotes.\n4. La question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada apr\u00e8s le mois de novembre 2006 est renvoy\u00e9e aux m\u00eames membres instructeurs du Tribunal, s\u2019ils sont disponibles, pour rendre une nouvelle d\u00e9cision conforme aux pr\u00e9sents motifs, sur le fondement du dossier existant.\n[5] Comme les m\u00eames membres instructeurs du Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles pour rendre la nouvelle d\u00e9cision telle qu\u2019ordonn\u00e9e, on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tait une exigence op\u00e9rationnelle justifi\u00e9e pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada apr\u00e8s novembre 2006, conform\u00e9ment aux motifs du jugement de la juge Mactavish et en fonction du dossier existant. Dans le cadre de mon r\u00e9examen, j\u2019ai lu les motifs du jugement de Mme Mactavish, dont j\u2019ai tenu compte, et j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 et consid\u00e9r\u00e9, dans sa forme int\u00e9grale, le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Steven Christopher Duke (le capitaine Duke), qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour Air Canada au sujet de l\u2019accommodement.\n[6] En ce qui a trait au t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke, la juge Mactavish a fait le commentaire suivant au paragraphe 429 de ses motifs :\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, Air Canada fait valoir que le Tribunal a mal compris et mal d\u00e9crit le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son argument relatif \u00e0 la contrainte excessive. Air Canada soutient \u00e9galement que le Tribunal a fait abstraction d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments importants du t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke au sujet des difficult\u00e9s de nature op\u00e9rationnelle et de production d\u2019horaires de vol qui surviendraient si Air Canada \u00e9tait tenue de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans.\nEt au paragraphe 384 :\nJe conviens aussi avec Air Canada que, compte tenu de la nature syst\u00e9mique des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne de MM. Vilven et Kelly, ainsi que du fait que l\u2019invalidation possible des dispositions en mati\u00e8re de retraite obligatoire du r\u00e9gime de retraite d\u2019Air Canada et de la convention collective conclue entre ce transporteur et l\u2019APAC aurait une incidence sur d\u2019autres pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, il \u00e9tait valable aussi pour le Tribunal d\u2019examiner de fa\u00e7on prospective la question de la contrainte excessive, en tenant compte des changements apport\u00e9s par la suite aux normes de l\u2019OACI [...]\nII. Le droit applicable A. Dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne 3.(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les r\u00e9affectations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n15.(1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[7] Dans ses motifs de jugement, la juge Mactavish r\u00e9sume les principes l\u00e9gaux qui gouvernent les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles justifi\u00e9es (aux paragraphes 353 \u00e0 358) :\nLe crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9cider si un employeur a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e est celui qu\u2019a formul\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin [Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, (1999) 3 R.C.S. 3]\nC\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019un employeur doit \u00e9tablir selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\n(1) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\n(2) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n(3) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\nLes premier et deuxi\u00e8me volets du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin exigent que l\u2019on \u00e9value la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme, ainsi que l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait l\u2019employeur au moment de l\u2019adopter. Cela a pour but de garantir que la norme, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e sur le plan aussi bien objectif que subjectif, ne comporte pas de fondement discriminatoire. Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la norme est exig\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser un but l\u00e9gitime, et si l\u2019employeur peut composer avec la plainte sans subir une contrainte excessive : Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 161, au paragraphe 14.\nComme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2008 CSC 43, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 561, l\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab impossible \u00bb en rapport avec le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin suscite une certaine confusion. La Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ce qui est exig\u00e9 \u00ab n\u2019est pas la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer un employ\u00e9 qui ne respecte pas une norme, mais bien la preuve d\u2019une contrainte excessive qui, elle, peut prendre autant de formes qu\u2019il y a de circonstances \u00bb : au paragraphe 12.\nQuant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de modifier de fa\u00e7on fondamentale les conditions de travail, mais il a cependant l\u2019obligation d\u2019am\u00e9nager, si cela ne lui cause pas une contrainte excessive, le poste de travail ou les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour lui permettre de fournir sa prestation de travail \u00bb : Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, au paragraphe 16.\n[8] De plus, la juge Mactavish a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme limitant \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et au co\u00fbt les facteurs dont on doit tenir compte dans une analyse d\u2019accommodement. Cependant, elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 sa conclusion en formulant l\u2019observation suivante :\nCela ne veut pas dire que des questions telles que le moral et la mobilit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s, l\u2019ing\u00e9rence dans les droits d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s et la rupture d\u2019une convention collective ne seront jamais pertinentes dans le cadre d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. La mani\u00e8re dont j\u2019interpr\u00e8te la loi signifie simplement que ces questions, pour \u00eatre prises en compte dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse de l\u2019accommodement, doivent \u00eatre suffisamment graves pour avoir un effet d\u00e9montrable sur les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un employeur, et ce, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui est li\u00e9e aux co\u00fbts, \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nIII. La preuve [9] Pour mon r\u00e9examen, il est important de tenir compte du changement du 23 novembre 2006 aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019Organisation de l\u2019aviation civile internationale (l\u2019OACI), une organisation des Nations Unies charg\u00e9e de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aviation civile \u2013 dont le Canada est membre \u2013 un changement qui rend obligatoire, pour les capitaines ou les pilotes commandants dont l\u2019\u00e2ge est de 60 \u00e0 65 ans et qui souhaitent continuer de piloter des vols internationaux, que l\u2019un des autres pilotes dans un \u00e9quipage \u00e0 plusieurs pilotes ait moins de 60 ans.\n[10] Les normes de l\u2019OACI ne s\u2019appliquent qu\u2019aux vols internationaux. La grande majorit\u00e9 des vols d\u2019Air Canada ont un aspect international, 86 % ont soit une destination internationale ou passent par un espace a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger (principalement aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis) pour se rendre \u00e0 une destination canadienne. De 20 \u00e0 25 % des 14 % des vols restants d\u2019Air Canada ont un a\u00e9roport aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis comme a\u00e9roport de secours o\u00f9 les avions doivent atterrir si, par exemple, des intemp\u00e9ries les emp\u00eachent d\u2019atterrir \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport canadien habituel.\n[11] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom d\u2019Air Canada quant \u00e0 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 probable de la compagnie d\u2019accommoder les pilotes de plus de 60 ans si l\u2019exigence de l\u2019OACI [traduction] \u00ab un pilote de plus de 60 ans\/un pilote de moins de 60 ans \u00bb (la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60) s\u2019applique aux horaires des pilotes de la compagnie.\n[12] Dans la p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le capitaine Duke \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 par Air Canada dans un poste de gestion des op\u00e9rations en vol. Parmi ses qualifications, le capitaine Duke d\u00e9tient la certification Six Sigma Black Belt en gestion des op\u00e9rations. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Six Sigma est un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9lioration des op\u00e9rations qui a vu le jour \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1980 dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Motorola et General Electric, et qu\u2019Air Canada a adopt\u00e9. Le titre de \u00ab Black Belt \u00bb (ceinture noire) du capitaine Duke reconna\u00eet l\u2019expertise de ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce processus.\n[13] Le capitaine Duke a commenc\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage en soulignant plusieurs cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives, y compris l\u2019augmentation in\u00e9vitable du nombre de pilotes et des co\u00fbts d\u2019op\u00e9rations de vol, ce qui serait un fardeau pour Air Canada si l\u2019obligation de retraite des pilotes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans \u00e9tait \u00e9limin\u00e9e : a) l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019accommoder les capitaines de plus de 65 ans pour les vols internationaux et domestiques; b) la capacit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e d\u2019accommoder les capitaines ou les premiers officiers qui ont plus de 60 ans; c) la perte de capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir \u00e0 l\u2019avance de fa\u00e7on juste les besoins d\u2019embauche et de formation et l\u2019effet que ces cons\u00e9quences auront sur Air Canada.\n[14] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, qui \u00e9taient environ 3200 en d\u00e9cembre 2006, sont regroup\u00e9s en fonction de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef qu\u2019ils pilotent :\n(1) les gros a\u00e9ronefs, qui ont surtout des vols internationaux, les Airbus\u2011345\u2011500, A\u2011340\u2011300 et A\u2011330 (qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement appel\u00e9s les A\u2011340);\n(2) les Boeing 767, 777 sur certains vols internationaux;\n(3) les A-320 et les A-319;\n(4) les Embraer 190 et 175.\n[15] Le capitaine Duke a expliqu\u00e9 que les A\u2011340 et les Boeing 767 n\u00e9cessitent trois pilotes dans la cabine, dont l\u2019un est un pilote de rel\u00e8ve.\n[traduction]\nDonc nos 3200 pilotes se divisent en 16 [\u2026] groupes qui ne sont pas interchangeables, qui sont alors divis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9ographique en 42 postes uniques. \u00ab Poste \u00bb est un terme de la convention collective qui est d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant la combinaison unique d\u2019\u00e9quipement, de statut et de base. Par exemple : le capitaine de Boeing triple\u20117 \u00e0 Toronto est un poste; \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le capitaine, il n\u2019y en a que 35. Si nous poursuivons plus loin dans la liste, l\u2019autre extr\u00eame du poste le plus achaland\u00e9 serait celui de capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320 \u00e0 Toronto, o\u00f9 il y en a 363. Donc, \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment, ces groupes ne sont pas interchangeables. Nous ne pouvons pas d\u00e9placer un pilote d\u2019un poste \u00e0 un autre \u2013 ils sont pris dans leur affectation.\nIls peuvent se d\u00e9placer un peu entre les bases, par exemple si on a un capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qui pilote un vol vers Toronto, on peut le d\u00e9placer \u00e0 Toronto pour ce vol, mais on ne peut pas placer un capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320 sur un vol de 767 ou un premier officier d\u2019A\u2011320 dans un poste de capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320.\n[16] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le capitaine Duke a expliqu\u00e9 les choix disponibles pour un pilote qui a, hypoth\u00e9tiquement, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1100 : il ou elle peut choisir d\u2019\u00eatre un capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320 au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9chelle qui pilote des vols selon des horaires du milieu de l\u2019\u00e9chelle, ou peut gagner plus d\u2019argent \u00e0 titre de capitaine de 767 sans d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et subir l\u2019horaire d\u2019un capitaine sans anciennet\u00e9. Le capitaine Duke a not\u00e9 qu\u2019avec l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, c\u2019est le pilote seul qui choisit s\u2019il souhaite devenir un capitaine d\u2019A\u2011320 avec beaucoup d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 ou un capitaine de 767 avec peu d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[17] Le capitaine Duke a d\u00e9crit un cheminement de carri\u00e8re typique pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada : ils d\u00e9butent soit comme pilote de rel\u00e8ve ou comme premier officier d\u2019un avion \u00e0 fuselage \u00e9troit, puis deviennent premier officier de gros porteur, retournent \u00e0 un avion \u00e0 fuselage \u00e9troit \u00e0 titre de capitaine et retournent enfin dans un gros porteur \u00e0 titre de capitaine, passant de cinq \u00e0 sept ans dans chaque bloc, pour terminer leur carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Le capitaine Duke a not\u00e9 que dans chaque bloc, les pilotes peuvent changer de poste.\n[18] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la corr\u00e9lation entre le service de marketing et le service des op\u00e9rations en vol d\u2019Air Canada :\n[traduction]\nNous sommes une compagnie ax\u00e9e sur le marketing et notre service de marketing produit une longue liste de vols que la compagnie souhaite voir le service des op\u00e9rations en vol effectuer dans les mois \u00e0 venir. Nous avons des gens que nous appelons des analystes de jumelage et l\u2019un de ces analystes est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque type d\u2019\u00e9quipage. Donc il y a un analyste pour les 340, un analyste pour les 767. Ce qu\u2019ils font, c\u2019est prendre l\u2019\u00e9norme liste de vols qui doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s et la diviser en des parties plus petites et plus faciles \u00e0 utiliser qui sont constitu\u00e9es d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de vols qui seront combin\u00e9s pour couvrir une p\u00e9riode d\u2019une journ\u00e9e ou une p\u00e9riode allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre jours.\n[19] Le capitaine Duke a ensuite d\u00e9crit un jumelage typique dans le groupe d\u2019A\u2011320 de Toronto : le vol 700 quittant Toronto \u00e0 6 h 30, arrivant \u00e0 New York juste avant 8 h. Quarante minutes plus tard, il devient le vol 705, de New York \u00e0 Toronto, arrivant \u00e0 10 h 10. Les pilotes ont ensuite deux heures et 40 minutes avant le d\u00e9part de leur prochain vol de Toronto, le vol 177 pour Edmonton, arrivant \u00e0 15 h, heure normale des Rocheuses. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la nuit \u00e0 Edmonton, les pilotes quittent le lendemain \u00e0 7 h et retournent \u00e0 Toronto :\n[traduction]\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019un jumelage de vol typique et r\u00e9el pour deux jours pour les pilotes de 320 de Toronto. Ce qu\u2019il faut noter au sujet de ce jumelage, c\u2019est que c\u2019est une combinaison de vols internationaux et domestiques.\n[20] Le capitaine Duke a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019objectif de l\u2019analyste de jumelage est de jumeler des vols afin de pr\u00e9voir une p\u00e9riode raisonnable entre les vols, les deux heures et quarante minutes susmentionn\u00e9es se trouvant au niveau sup\u00e9rieur du temps d\u2019attente pour les pilotes, et il a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a d\u2019autres garanties dans la convention collective qui poussent la compagnie \u00e0 maximiser la productivit\u00e9 des heures des pilotes lorsqu\u2019ils travaillent.\n[21] Duke a ensuite d\u00e9crit le processus suivi par les op\u00e9rations en vol apr\u00e8s que le service de marketing ait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ses besoins en mati\u00e8re de vols. Lorsque la directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des ressources du poste de pilotage re\u00e7oit la liste de vols du service de marketing [traduction] \u00ab elle passera de deux semaines \u00e0 un mois \u00e0 ajuster le nombre de postes qu\u2019elle doit couvrir \u00bb. Apr\u00e8s cela, le comit\u00e9 directeur de composition des \u00e9quipages (le CMSC), un comit\u00e9 patronal\u2011syndical, approuve le plan tel que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ou modifi\u00e9, lan\u00e7ant ainsi la p\u00e9riode de deux semaines qu\u2019ont les pilotes pour mettre \u00e0 jour leur choix pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel permanent en fonction des occasions qui leur sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans l\u2019horaire des vols pr\u00e9vus, et de poser leur candidature pour un poste. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke, je d\u00e9duis que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est absolument essentielle afin de permettre aux pilotes de prendre l\u2019initiative du contr\u00f4le de leur carri\u00e8re au sein d\u2019Air Canada.\n[22] Le capitaine Duke a d\u00e9crit la relation de travail entre le service des op\u00e9rations en vol et le service de marketing du point de vue du CMSC, qui effectue un examen deux fois par ann\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective :\n[traduction]\nCe qu\u2019il faut noter, c\u2019est que nous \u00e9tablissons un plan de formation pour les 12 mois \u00e0 venir, et que six mois plus tard, nous recommen\u00e7ons [\u2026] nous travaillons \u00e0 achever ce plan, mais nous n\u2019y arrivons jamais. Nous nous rendons \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9, puis nous recommen\u00e7ons. C\u2019est un environnement tr\u00e8s dynamique dans lequel notre service de marketing tente d\u2019\u00eatre tr\u00e8s sensible \u00e0 ce que les consommateurs acceptent pour notre produit et, par cons\u00e9quent, le service de marketing change ses plans constamment. C\u2019est un c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quation. De l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 se trouvent les op\u00e9rations en vol qui ont besoin de beaucoup de temps pour r\u00e9pondre aux changements. [\u2026] Notre fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs besoins est de modifier notre liste de postes \u00e0 tous les six mois [\u2026] ce qui nous donne l\u2019assurance [\u2026] de savoir ce que nous faisons pour les six prochains mois avant que l\u2019examen du CMSC recommence. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un compromis entre les deux diff\u00e9rents services de la compagnie.\n[23] Le capitaine Duke a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage exhaustif au sujet des difficult\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au niveau des horaires et des co\u00fbts qu\u2019Air Canada subirait probablement si la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans \u00e9tait abolie. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada devrait embaucher plus de pilotes pour garantir le respect absolu de la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60 pour tous les vols internationaux et partiellement internationaux.\n[24] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait effectu\u00e9 des simulations \u00e9lectroniques en fonction de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle Air Canada n\u2019avait plus la certitude qu\u2019apportait la retraite obligatoire des pilotes \u00e0 60 ans. Dans l\u2019une des simulations, le capitaine Duke a tent\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir des vols pour des pilotes qui ont plus de 60 ans et qui seraient vis\u00e9s par la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60, et a conclu qu\u2019\u00e0 mesure que le nombre de pilotes de plus de 60 ans augmente, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019horaires devient impraticable.\n[traduction]\nLe membre pr\u00e9sident : \u00ab Parce que \u2026? \u00bb\nLe capitaine Duke : \u00ab Parce que notre logiciel ne peut pas r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me : il n\u2019y a pas assez de pilotes non restreints pour piloter avec les autres pilotes restreints. \u00bb\n[25] Le capitaine Duke a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un graphique qu\u2019il a identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant les capitaines d\u2019A\u2011340 de Vancouver d\u2019Air Canada, les pla\u00e7ant en ordre d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, qui montrait que 85 % des capitaines de Vancouver ont 55 ans ou plus. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que si la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans \u00e9tait abolie, alors au cours des cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es, 85 % de ces capitaines seraient probablement dans le groupe d\u2019\u00e2ge vis\u00e9 par la restriction, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019ils auraient plus de 60 ans, mais pas encore 65 ans, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils seraient vis\u00e9s par la r\u00e8gle de plus de 60\/moins de 60 qui les emp\u00eache de piloter des vols internationaux, \u00e0 moins que le pilote les accompagnant ait moins de 60 ans.\n[26] Le capitaine Duke a d\u00e9crit un probl\u00e8me semblable auquel font face les premiers officiers d\u2019A\u2011340 \u00e0 Vancouver :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Par exemple le pilote qui est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le point le plus \u00e0 gauche a 57 ans. S\u2019il reste [\u2026] cinq ans jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 62 ans [\u2026] il sera restreint et ne pourra pas piloter avec d\u2019autres capitaines [\u2026]\nLorsque la mise en candidature pour l\u2019horaire mensuel d\u00e9bute, ils peuvent choisir exactement ce qu\u2019ils veulent. Ils ont de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, ils ont le premier choix pour tout. Bien, pas n\u00e9cessairement, parce que nous classons l\u2019horaire des capitaines en premier et si tous les vols que vous voulez ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 un autre pilote possiblement restreint, vous ne pouvez pas piloter avec cette personne. Donc vos droits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 sont affect\u00e9s par la restriction possible d\u2019avoir \u00e0 piloter avec des capitaines sur les vols qui vous int\u00e9ressent.\n[27] Les pilotes d\u2019A\u2011340 d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 Toronto ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Soixante\u2011dix\u2011huit pour cent d\u2019entre eux ont 55 ans ou plus. D\u2019ici cinq ans, ils auront aussi l\u2019\u00e2ge de restriction. Le capitaine Duke a trouv\u00e9 que les m\u00eames chiffres s\u2019appliquaient aux pilotes de Vancouver et de Toronto dans le groupe des Boeing 767.\n[28] Le capitaine Duke a poursuivi son analyse, supposant que 10 % des capitaines et des premiers officiers \u00e9taient restreints par la r\u00e8gle de plus de 60\/moins de 60. Il est important de noter que l\u2019horaire simul\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant ne tenait pas compte de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de nombreux premiers officiers et leur a attribu\u00e9 le statut de r\u00e9serviste. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de r\u00e9servistes, ils ne pourraient pas remplacer un premier officier malade affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un vol avec un capitaine de plus de 60 ans.\n[traduction]\nLorsque nous traitons d\u2019une petite base comme celle des A-340 de Vancouver, le nombre est effroyablement petit. Avec 20 % des capitaines restreints et 11 % des premiers officiers restreints [\u2026] nous ne pouvons pas g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un horaire.\nLe membre Jensen : \u00ab \u00c0 moins que vous embauchiez un pilote suppl\u00e9mentaire. \u00bb\nLe capitaine Duke : \u00ab C\u2019est la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9vidente [\u2026] d\u2019introduire d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on plus de pilotes qui ne sont pas restreints [\u2026] Bien entendu, notre syst\u00e8me actuel est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, alors cela retournerait [\u2026] \u00e0 l\u2019examen du CMSC. [\u2026] Disons que nous ouvrons deux postes de plus, [\u2026] l\u2019examen du CMSC est effectu\u00e9 [\u2026], si ces deux nouveaux pilotes ont 62 ans, nous n\u2019avons rien gagn\u00e9, parce que nous n\u2019avons pas le droit de restreindre des pilotes en fonction de l\u2019\u00e2ge et de les emp\u00eacher d\u2019obtenir ces postes [\u2026] Nous ne pouvons pas garantir, selon toute m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9vue dans notre convention collective, qu\u2019il y aurait moins de 11 % des premiers officiers qui seraient restreints. \u00bb\n[\u2026]\nLe membre Tremblay : \u00ab Qu\u2019est\u2011ce que cela fait au moral des pilotes si vous ne tenez pas compte de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 afin de surmonter ou de minimiser [\u2026] une partie de ces probl\u00e8mes? \u00bb\nLe capitaine Duke : \u00ab L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est l\u2019un des concepts les plus importants de l\u2019APAC et on nous l\u2019a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de nombreuses fois \u00e0 la table de n\u00e9gociations. En fonction de la restriction que nous imposerions, la r\u00e9action serait n\u00e9gative ou tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative. Si nous sugg\u00e9rions d\u2019embaucher directement une personne \u00e0 un poste aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de premier officier d\u2019A\u2011340 de Vancouver, cela paralyserait Air Canada. Nous aurions des r\u00e9actions extr\u00eames comme nous n\u2019en avons jamais vues auparavant. [\u2026] nous ne tenterions jamais de pr\u00e9senter une telle suggestion. \u00bb\n[\u2026]\nLe membre Tremblay : \u00ab Est\u2011ce qu\u2019Air Canada a subi des r\u00e9actions extr\u00eames ou des probl\u00e8mes de ce genre en raison de pr\u00e9occupations au niveau du moral des pilotes quant \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 auparavant? \u00bb\nLe capitaine Duke : \u00ab Lors de la fusion, \u00e7a ne c\u2019est pas bien pass\u00e9 en ce qui a trait aux pilotes, parce qu\u2019il y a eu des divergences d\u2019opinion entre les pilotes [de Canadian Airline] et les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada quant \u00e0 savoir de quelle fa\u00e7on les deux listes d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 seraient fusionn\u00e9es. Nous avons eu diverses versions de cong\u00e9s de maladie en bloc associ\u00e9es aux diverses d\u00e9cisions de la Commission des relations de travail \u00e0 ce sujet [\u2026] nous avons eu un aper\u00e7u de l\u2019effet des modifications \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et de la fa\u00e7on dont ces modifications affectent le moral des pilotes. \u00bb\n[29] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la retraite obligatoire des pilotes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans procure \u00e0 Air Canada une stabilit\u00e9 et une pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 en ce qui a trait aux besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche et de formation et qu\u2019il y a un risque op\u00e9rationnel associ\u00e9 avec le changement de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite :\n[traduction] Nous nous fondons sur le fait que les pilotes prennent leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans et les examens du CMSC sont fond\u00e9s sur ce fait; nous formons les pilotes en fonction de ce fait [\u2026] Donc, si nous d\u00e9pla\u00e7ons l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 une limite plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, ou si nous enlevons la limite, nous allons probablement nous retrouver avec des retraites impr\u00e9vues parce que rien dans la convention collective n\u2019oblige nos pilotes \u00e0 donner un pr\u00e9avis du moment auquel ils prendront leur retraite. Cela aura un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les op\u00e9rations d\u2019Air Canada et entra\u00eenera des co\u00fbts plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s.\n[30] Lorsque le membre Jensen lui a demand\u00e9 si Air Canada pouvait imposer une obligation d\u2019avis de retraite \u00e0 ses pilotes, le capitaine Duke a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019imposer unilat\u00e9ralement quoi que ce soit aux pilotes, que tout devait \u00eatre n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec l\u2019APAC, et qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab faudrait beaucoup de capital de n\u00e9gociation de la part de la compagnie, recommen\u00e7ant \u00e0 z\u00e9ro, pour n\u00e9gocier une telle chose. \u00bb\n[31] Le membre Jensen a aussi demand\u00e9 une clarification du t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke au sujet du besoin de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la retraite :\n[traduction]\nLe membre Jensen : \u00ab Je veux m\u2019assurer d\u2019avoir bien compris, lorsque vous dites que c\u2019est l\u2019un de vos plus gros probl\u00e8mes, ce que vous voulez dire, c\u2019est que la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 de la retraite est l\u2019un des plus gros probl\u00e8mes du fait de ne pas avoir une date de retraite obligatoire. C\u2019est \u00e7a? \u00bb\n[32] Duke a confirm\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas et, utilisant le groupe d\u2019A\u2011340 de Vancouver \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada a :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] du travail pour six personnes \u00e0 Vancouver qui nous permet d\u2019absorber les chocs externes dans nos op\u00e9rations. Lorsque nous d\u00e9passons ce nombre \u2013 toutes nos pr\u00e9visions devenant r\u00e9alit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la maladie, au nombre de personnes en formation, au nombre de superviseurs que nous avons sur place, au nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s que nous avons \u2013 six est le chiffre magique que nous pouvons utiliser pour absorber les chocs externes tels que la retraite anticip\u00e9e. D\u00e9passons ce nombre et nous devons annuler des vols. Donc, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 votre question directement, le probl\u00e8me est la planification du nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s dont nous avons besoin; et pour les postes qui demandent le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, nous b\u00e9n\u00e9ficions actuellement d\u2019une constante en mati\u00e8re de retraite pour notre planification, nous savons \u00e0 quel moment les pilotes vont prendre leur retraite et ils le font g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au moment pr\u00e9vu. Si nous perdions cela parce que le Tribunal ordonnait un changement \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire et que nous ne pouvions pas r\u00e9gler la question aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019APAC, nous aurions \u00e0 obtenir une autre forme d\u2019assurance en ayant des pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires pour ces postes.\n[33] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, compte tenu des restrictions de la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60 de l\u2019OACI, et en l\u2019absence d\u2019une retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, les op\u00e9rations en vol d\u2019Air Canada verraient une importante augmentation des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux pilotes et des complications dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des horaires.\n[34] Traitant de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir un horaire de vols domestiques pour les pilotes de plus de 65 ans, le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible, parce que 86 % de ces vols survolent habituellement une partie des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis :\n[traduction]\nDonc si nous devions d\u00e9placer les vols domestiques qui, normalement, survoleraient les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, afin de les garder uniquement dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien, [\u2026] cela [\u2026] augmenterait le temps de vol, ce qui augmenterait les co\u00fbts et retarderait aussi le prochain vol de la journ\u00e9e, ce que nous refusons fermement de faire.\nDans les cas extr\u00eames, (par exemple) un vol de Vancouver \u00e0 Toronto, pour un A\u2011320 qui compte parmi les plus longs vols domestiques, si nous devons mettre plus d\u2019essence \u00e0 bord, nous pourrions devoir retirer des passagers parce que l\u2019avion serait \u00e0 sa limite maximale quant au poids.\n[35] Le capitaine Duke a donn\u00e9 des renseignements pr\u00e9cis au sujet des co\u00fbts de carburant suppl\u00e9mentaire, citant 62 vols de Toronto \u00e0 Halifax, chaque vol co\u00fbtant 1 695 $ de plus, ce qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 5,5 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e.\n[36] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019une des simulations qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9e, pour illustrer l\u2019un des pires sc\u00e9narios, afin de d\u00e9terminer les cons\u00e9quences du fait d\u2019accommoder les pilotes qui ont plus de 65 ans en les utilisant exclusivement pour les vols domestiques, le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] cela pose les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes que ceux que nous avons vus pour Toronto\/Halifax [\u2026] il faut 1 700 heures de jumelage additionnel pour suivre exactement le m\u00eame horaire. \u00bb Il a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque les analystes de jumelage doivent diviser l\u2019horaire de vol en deux groupes pour accommoder les capitaines restreints par l\u2019OACI, cela annule l\u2019optimisation, qui vise \u00e0 minimiser les co\u00fbts inh\u00e9rents en g\u00e9n\u00e9rant des jumelages efficaces. Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019avoir deux groupes de pilotes pour couvrir le m\u00eame horaire, dont un groupe est restreint par la r\u00e8gle de plus de 60\/moins de 60, cr\u00e9e une situation qui n\u00e9cessite l\u2019emploi de 42 pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires et que ces pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessiteraient eux\u2011m\u00eames des pilotes de r\u00e9serve en fonction d\u2019un facteur de 34 %, ce qui augmenterait le nombre de pilotes de r\u00e9serve \u00e0 56, chaque pilote co\u00fbtant 11 500 $ par mois, ce qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 7,7 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e.\nIV. Nouvelle d\u00e9cision [37] Les param\u00e8tres de la nouvelle d\u00e9cision ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis par la juge Mactavish aux paragraphes 469, 470 et 471 de ses motifs de jugement :\n469 J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9 que la conclusion du Tribunal au sujet de la question de l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, en rapport avec la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au mois de novembre 2006, \u00e9tait raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, toute erreur de la part du Tribunal au sujet des deux premi\u00e8res conditions du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin n\u2019est pas pertinente si elle se rapporte \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n470 Cependant, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019analyse du Tribunal au sujet de l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, relativement \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure au mois de novembre 2006, comporte un certain nombre d\u2019erreurs qui font que cet aspect de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal est d\u00e9raisonnable.\n471 De ce fait, je renverrai la question de savoir si le fait d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada apr\u00e8s le mois de novembre 2006 aux m\u00eames membres instructeurs du Tribunal, en prescrivant que la question soit examin\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des trois conditions du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[38] Par cons\u00e9quent, la nouvelle d\u00e9cision est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode suivant novembre 2006.\n[39] Rien dans le dossier des instances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes ne laisse entendre que le Tribunal, ou le juge en contr\u00f4le judiciaire, a relev\u00e9 un manque de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 chez le capitaine Duke. Compte tenu de mon examen de son t\u00e9moignage, je suis convaincu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. De plus, je suis d\u2019avis que son t\u00e9moignage est coh\u00e9rent et fort.\n[40] Le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke a \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, que l\u2019\u00e9limination de la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans pour les pilotes, que ce soit dans le cadre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ou par la r\u00e9vision de la convention collective, entra\u00eenerait un lourd fardeau afin de respecter la r\u00e8gle de plus de 60\/moins de 60 de l\u2019OACI.\n[41] Il est fort probable que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019horaires pour les pilotes de plus de 60 ans deviendrait moins efficace et plus co\u00fbteux par rapport \u00e0 la certitude que la compagnie a connue gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de retraite obligatoire qui est en place depuis 1957. J\u2019accepte l\u2019\u00e9valuation succincte du capitaine Duke au sujet de la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60 : [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est le caract\u00e8re conditionnel de la restriction qui cause les probl\u00e8mes \u00bb.\n[42] La description du capitaine Duke du fonctionnement des op\u00e9rations en vol d\u2019Air Canada r\u00e9v\u00e8le un \u00e9quilibre pratique et efficace entre les exigences de vol du service de marketing et la capacit\u00e9 du service des op\u00e9rations en vol d\u2019affecter des pilotes \u00e0 ces vols. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9limination de la disposition portant sur l\u2019obligation de retraite dans la convention collective, combin\u00e9e aux restrictions de la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60, exigerait l\u2019emploi de plus de pilotes, qui entra\u00eenerait des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires, afin de garantir que tous les vols seront pilot\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de plus de 60\/moins de 60 de l\u2019OACI.\n[43] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke, il est inconcevable qu\u2019Air Canada et l\u2019APAC acceptent volontairement, toutes les deux, le manque de souplesse et les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait de jumeler [traduction] \u00ab un pilote de plus de 60 ans avec un pilote de moins de 60 ans \u00bb dans toutes les cabines des a\u00e9ronefs d\u2019Air Canada.\n[44] Je tiens compte de l\u2019arr\u00eat F.H. c. McDougall, 2008 CSC 53, et de la clarification de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada au sujet de la norme de preuve dans les affaires civiles : rien de plus, rien de moins que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve.\n[45] Bien que l\u2019obligation de retraite d\u2019Air Canada pour les pilotes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans soit, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, discriminatoire, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire si Air Canada \u00e9tablit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, que la limite est fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer est celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, qui est un processus \u00e0 trois \u00e9tapes.\n[46] La premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessitent une \u00e9valuation du caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme (de travail) et de l\u2019intention de l\u2019employeur lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019a adopt\u00e9e. L\u2019\u00e9valuation doit \u00eatre objective et subjective afin de garantir que la norme n\u2019a pas un fondement discriminatoire.\n[47] Le t\u00e9moignage de Duke montre clairement que, pendant des d\u00e9cennies, Air Canada a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un processus de n\u00e9gociation l\u00e9gitime et important avec le syndicat des pilotes qui s\u2019est conclu par une convention collective durable qui consacre l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et qui pr\u00e9voit la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans avec une pension raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, Air Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer de fa\u00e7on efficace l\u2019introduction de nouveaux pilotes afin de remplacer un nombre pr\u00e9visible de pilotes prenant leur retraite. Ayant \u00e9valu\u00e9 cette situation tant de fa\u00e7on subjective que de fa\u00e7on objective, je conclus selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que la norme de travail n\u2019a pas de fondement discriminatoire.\n[48] La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin exige un examen \u00e0 savoir si la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie afin d\u2019accomplir un objectif l\u00e9gitime. Une fois de plus, persuad\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke, je conclus selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que la norme de travail de l\u2019obligation de retraite dans la convention collective sign\u00e9e par Air Canada et l\u2019APAC visait \u00e0 accomplir l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gitime de la fusion des besoins de la compagnie avec les droits et les besoins collectifs de ses pilotes.\n[49] La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape oblige aussi Air Canada \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019elle subirait une contrainte excessive si elle accommodait les plaignants. Compte tenu des restrictions de la r\u00e8gle plus de 60\/moins de 60 de l\u2019OACI, je suis convaincu que l\u2019accommodement des besoins des plaignants dans la p\u00e9riode suivant novembre 2006, par l\u2019abolition de la retraite obligatoire, entra\u00eenerait des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pour Air Canada : l\u2019augmentation importante des co\u00fbts op\u00e9rationnels, l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019horaires pour les pilotes et, dans une moindre mesure, des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur le r\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes et sur la convention collective, en particulier dans le maintien d\u2019une r\u00e8gle efficace quant \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Je conclus selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve qu\u2019Air Canada subirait une contrainte excessive si elle devait accommoder les besoins des plaignants.\nV. Conclusion [50] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si le fait d\u2019avoir moins de 60 ans est une exigence op\u00e9rationnelle justifi\u00e9e pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada apr\u00e8s novembre 2006, je suis convaincu selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que :\n(1) La retraite obligatoire des pilotes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, et que par cons\u00e9quent il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire;\n(2) L\u2019accommodement des besoins des plaignants apr\u00e8s novembre 2006 imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Air Canada au niveau de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des co\u00fbts.\nVI. D\u00e9cision [51] Les plaignants George Vilven et Robert Kelly n\u2019ont pas prouv\u00e9 leur all\u00e9gation de pratique de r\u00e9duction de la part d\u2019Air Canada pour la p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s novembre 2006. Par cons\u00e9quent, leurs plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Introduction [1] La pr\u00e9sente instance vise soixante-dix plaignants, dont soixante-huit sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat (les plaignants). Les plaignants, qui travaillaient comme pilotes chez Air Canada, all\u00e8guent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de discrimination de la part de cette derni\u00e8re et de l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (l\u2019APAC) (les intim\u00e9es) en raison de leur \u00e2ge parce qu\u2019il leur est demand\u00e9 de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, contrairement aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Les dates de leur retraite obligatoire vont de 2005 \u00e0 2009.\n[2] Pour que leurs plaintes soient accueillies, les plaignants doivent \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination puis, cela \u00e9tant, il incombe aux intim\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tablir un moyen de d\u00e9fense sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve.\n[3] Selon les modalit\u00e9s de la convention collective conclue entre Air Canada et l\u2019APAC et les conditions du r\u00e9gime de retraite, les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada sont tenus de prendre leur retraite le premier jour du mois suivant leur 60e anniversaire. L\u2019annexe A modifi\u00e9e, soit les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019emploi des plaignants (4 janvier 2010) fournis par Air Canada, mentionne le nom, la date de naissance, la date du 60e anniversaire et la date de la retraite de chaque plaignant. Il ressort que tous les plaignants \u00e9taient retrait\u00e9s \u00e0 la date prescrite. Leur emploi a pris fin uniquement en raison de leur \u00e2ge. Ce fait n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9es. En cons\u00e9quence, les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[4] Les intim\u00e9es ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux moyens de d\u00e9fense contre l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination : premi\u00e8rement, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la et, deuxi\u00e8mement, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15 (1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\nA. \u00c2ge normal de la retraite, alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCPD [5] Dans sa d\u00e9cision rendue le 9 avril 2009 dans Vilven et Kelly c. Air Canada et l\u2019APAC, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP \u00e9tait celui des pilotes qui effectuaient des vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 bord de gros-porteurs, vers des destinations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, pour une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international.\n[6] La Cour a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) am\u00e8ne \u00e0 se poser deux questions : premi\u00e8rement, \u00ab [q]uel est le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 pour ce qui est d\u2019\u00e9tablir le genre d\u2019emploi que d\u00e9tenaient les plaignants? \u00bb et, deuxi\u00e8mement, \u00ab [q]uel est l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite? \u00bb.\n[7] En outre, pour \u00e9valuer si un emploi est le \u00ab genre \u00bb d\u2019emploi occup\u00e9 par les plaignants, il faudrait mettre l\u2019accent sur les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s fonctionnelles objectives de l\u2019emploi en question. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, que font r\u00e9ellement les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada?\n[8] Pour la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : \u00ab Ce que les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada font essentiellement, c\u2019est \u00eatre aux commandes d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de taille et de type divers, transportant des voyageurs vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales, en traversant l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger \u00bb (paragraphe 111).\n[9] Ainsi, le bon groupe de comparaison devrait \u00eatre celui des \u00ab pilotes au service de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes canadiennes et aux commandes d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de taille et de type divers, transportant des voyageurs vers des destinations \u00e0 la fois int\u00e9rieures et internationales, en traversant l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger \u00bb (paragraphe 112) (le crit\u00e8re).\n[10] La Cour reprend ce crit\u00e8re au paragraphe 125 de sa d\u00e9cision lorsqu\u2019elle affirme ce qui suit : \u00ab Pour r\u00e9sumer mes conclusions sur ce point : l\u2019essentiel de ce que font les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada peut \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme suit : \u201cpiloter des appareils de taille et de type divers, transportant des voyageurs vers des destinations \u00e0 la fois int\u00e9rieures et internationales, en traversant l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger\u201d. De nombreux pilotes canadiens occupent des postes semblables, y compris ceux qui sont au service d\u2019autres entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien canadiennes. Ce sont ces pilotes-l\u00e0 qui constituent le groupe de comparaison pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[11] La Cour a fait observer qu\u2019\u00e0 la date de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits soumis au Tribunal par les parties dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven, il existait au Canada cinq transporteurs a\u00e9riens, \u00e0 part Air Canada, qui s\u2019occupaient de transporter des voyageurs vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales : Jazz, Air Transat, CanJet, Skyservice et WestJet. Il n\u2019y a rien dans cette observation qui semble indiquer que la Cour a reconnu que ces cinq compagnies a\u00e9riennes satisfaisaient toutes au crit\u00e8re relatif au groupe de comparaison, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 aux paragraphes 112 et 125.\n[12] Fait int\u00e9ressant, la Cour a poursuivi en disant au paragraphe 170 de sa d\u00e9cision : \u00ab comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je suis d\u2019avis que le Tribunal a commis une erreur dans son identification du \u201cgenre d\u2019emploi\u201d \u00bb. \u00ab Ce sont les pilotes au service d\u2019entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international canadiennes, aux commandes d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses se rendant \u00e0 des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales, en traversant l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger, qui constituent le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 \u00bb. Les expressions \u00ab transportant des voyageurs \u00bb et \u00ab \u00e0 la fois \u00bb en ce qui concerne les destinations et \u00ab type \u00bb \u00e0 propos de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef sont absents de cette formulation du crit\u00e8re relatif au groupe de comparaison.\n[13] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la deuxi\u00e8me question : \u00ab [q]uel est l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite? \u00bb, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir une r\u00e8gle imp\u00e9rative obligeant \u00e0 prendre sa retraite \u00e0 un \u00e2ge fixe pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). La LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit pas que la d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) n\u2019est disponible que dans les cas o\u00f9 il existe, dans une industrie donn\u00e9e, une r\u00e8gle imp\u00e9rative obligeant \u00e0 prendre sa retraite \u00e0 un \u00e2ge en particulier. Plut\u00f4t, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite qui est en litige doit \u00eatre l\u2019\u00e2ge normal ou habituel au sein du secteur industriel applicable : comme ce fut le cas dans McAllister c. Association des employeurs maritimes, (1999) 36 C.H.R.R. D\/446 (C.F. 1re inst.), o\u00f9 la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence marqu\u00e9e entre l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur et l\u2019\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite.\n[14] La Cour convient avec le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven que la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite n\u00e9cessite une analyse statistique du d\u00e9nombrement total des emplois similaires. Il faut donc d\u00e9terminer, en se fondant sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments factuels, l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel une majorit\u00e9 d\u2019employ\u00e9s occupant des postes semblables prennent leur retraite, que ce soit obligatoire ou normal de la prendre.\n[15] Dans Campbell c. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que 60 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite parce qu\u2019environ 81 % des agents de bord canadiens \u00e9taient tenus de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 cet \u00e2ge-l\u00e0 en vertu de leur convention collective. Dans Canadian National Railway c. Prior (1983), 4 C.H.R.R.D\/268, le fait que 60 % des employ\u00e9s devaient prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisant pour conclure que 65 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite.\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven, la Cour a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux preuves statistiques pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal au sujet des pilotes de ligne travaillant \u00e0 la fois pour Air Canada et pour d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes canadiennes choisies comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de comparaison. Ces preuves ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que 56,13 % des pilotes de ligne canadiens prenaient leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. La Cour a estim\u00e9 que 60 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP. (Le Tribunal en est arriv\u00e9 au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat, mais en appliquant un crit\u00e8re diff\u00e9rent pour d\u00e9terminer le groupe de comparaison).\n[17] Les plaignants contestent le recours \u00e0 une analyse statistique en faisant valoir que le Tribunal est tenu d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) dans son contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la LCDP et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, ce qui peut ou non concorder avec les autres d\u00e9cisions judiciaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 cette disposition. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette position, les plaignants se fondent sur diverses sources, notamment les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, le r\u00e8glement en vertu de la LCDP, les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du S\u00e9nat, une directive de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d\u2019autres autorit\u00e9s judiciaires.\n[18] Ces sources ne pr\u00e9voient pas une analyse statistique pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite. Les plaignants vont plus loin et sugg\u00e8rent que, selon cette approche contextuelle, il peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer impossible de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite. Ainsi, ils soutiennent que les intim\u00e9es ne devraient pas pouvoir se pr\u00e9valoir du moyen de d\u00e9fense que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c).\n[19] Bien que ce soit un argument tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, je ne vois pas comment je peux faire fi des autres d\u00e9cisions judiciaires, comme le pr\u00e9conisent les plaignants, notamment celles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ces d\u00e9cisions traitent des m\u00eames questions que celles qui sont abord\u00e9es ici et lient le Tribunal.\nB. Quel devrait \u00eatre le crit\u00e8re pour le groupe de comparaison? [20] Au sujet du groupe de comparaison, les intim\u00e9es acceptent la formule employ\u00e9e par la Cour aux paragraphes 112 et 125, et s\u2019appuient sur celle-ci. Les plaignants ont une opinion diff\u00e9rente. Tant les plaignants que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) affirment que la formule prescrite par la Cour dans les deux paragraphes en question de sa d\u00e9cision ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la lettre dans la d\u00e9termination des groupes de comparaison appropri\u00e9s. Au contraire, le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par les faits de cette affaire et ne devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que comme une ligne directrice qui aide le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9finir le groupe de comparaison.\n[21] Tant les plaignants que la CCDP attirent l\u2019attention sur le paragraphe 170 de la d\u00e9cision Vilven en guise d\u2019appui \u00e0 leur position et proposent que le crit\u00e8re devrait tenir compte des \u00ab pilotes au service d\u2019entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international canadiennes, aux commandes d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses se rendant \u00e0 des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales, en traversant l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger \u00bb. Ils affirment que la Cour a ajout\u00e9 l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e0 la fois \u00bb dans le crit\u00e8re relativement aux destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales pour insister sur le fait que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en limitant le groupe de comparaison aux transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui ne font que des vols \u00e0 destination internationale. La Cour n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de faire en sorte que la d\u00e9finition du groupe de comparaison soit plus restrictive que celle du Tribunal. Le paragraphe devrait \u00eatre pris isol\u00e9ment pour y inclure un transporteur a\u00e9rien qui exploite des vols uniquement vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures ou uniquement vers des destinations internationales.\n[22] En outre, tant les plaignants que la CCDP affirment que l\u2019absence de l\u2019expression \u00ab de type divers \u00bb dans le paragraphe 170 est logique, sinon, deux des principaux concurrents d\u2019Air Canada, qui n\u2019exploitent qu\u2019un type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, seraient exclus du groupe de comparaison.\n[23] Il en est ainsi m\u00eame si leurs pilotes ne font essentiellement que ce que les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada font, soit transporter les passagers vers des destinations nationales et internationales. La CCDP supprimerait \u00e9galement du crit\u00e8re l\u2019expression \u00ab de tailles diverses \u00bb en faisant valoir que la taille n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance. Que l\u2019a\u00e9ronef soit petit, moyen ou gros, l\u2019essentiel de ce que fait un pilote ne change pas.\n[24] Il est regrettable que la Cour ait poursuivi en d\u00e9finissant le crit\u00e8re relatif au groupe de comparaison pour une troisi\u00e8me fois et d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelque peu diff\u00e9rente de celle figurant au paragraphe 170 de sa d\u00e9cision. La Cour n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9, \u00e0 ce stade avanc\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9cision, pourquoi ce crit\u00e8re devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, cela devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 davantage comme une question d\u2019inattention plut\u00f4t que comme une red\u00e9finition du crit\u00e8re en question.\n[25] Ce que le Tribunal doit faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est ce qu\u2019a fait la Cour dans Vilven, soit poser la question suivante et y r\u00e9pondre : quel est l\u2019essentiel de ce que font les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada? Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montrent que ce que font les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada est d\u00e9crit par la Cour dans Vilven aux paragraphes 112 et 125. Ainsi, les facteurs \u00e0 appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont identiques \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s dans Vilven pour d\u00e9terminer le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9.\n(i) Le groupe de comparaison des intim\u00e9es [26] Il incombe aux intim\u00e9es de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie par les plaignants. Pour ce faire, les intim\u00e9es ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve deux tableaux : [traduction] \u00ab Tableau des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens, facteurs s\u2019appliquant au groupe de comparaison, 2005 \u00e0 2008 \u00bb (\u00ab R-Tableau 1 \u00bb) produit par le capitaine Steven Duke, Six Sigma Black Belt, Op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes. Le deuxi\u00e8me tableau, [traduction] \u00ab Tableau r\u00e9vis\u00e9 des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens, facteurs s\u2019appliquant au groupe de comparaison en octobre 2009 \u00bb (\u00ab R\u2011Tableau 2 \u00bb), a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit par Harlan Clark, directeur, Relations de travail chez Air Canada.\n[27] Les deux tableaux des intim\u00e9es traitent des activit\u00e9s des m\u00eames transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s par les plaignants, le capitaine Duke pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2008 et M. Clark pour 2009. Ils comptent 37 transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens \u00e0 examiner. Dans les tableaux, il est inscrit [traduction] \u00ab oui \u00bb ou [traduction] \u00ab non \u00bb sous chacun des cinq volets du crit\u00e8re. Lorsque c\u2019est \u00ab oui \u00bb pour l\u2019ensemble des volets, le transporteur a\u00e9rien fait partie du groupe de comparaison.\n[28] En ce qui concerne les \u00ab tailles diverses \u00bb, le capitaine Duke ainsi que M. Clark se sont appuy\u00e9s sur la d\u00e9finition fournie par l\u2019Office des transports du Canada (OTC) dans son Guide pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de demandes : Par les transporteurs canadiens pour obtenir une licence en vue d\u2019exploiter un service national ou international \u00e0 la demande. Ils ont choisi la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019OTC plut\u00f4t que celle des sous-parties 703, 704 et 705 de Transports Canada (TC), parce qu\u2019elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au nombre de si\u00e8ges et, dans le cas des compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui transportent des passagers, le nombre de si\u00e8ges \u00e9tait un d\u00e9nominateur commun \u00e0 tous les transporteurs a\u00e9riens.\n[29] L\u2019OTC classe les a\u00e9ronefs en fonction de la capacit\u00e9 maximale certifi\u00e9e (CMC). Un \u00ab gros a\u00e9ronef \u00bb est un a\u00e9ronef \u00e9quip\u00e9 pour le transport de passagers et ayant une CMC de plus de 89 passagers. Un \u00ab a\u00e9ronef moyen \u00bb est un a\u00e9ronef \u00e9quip\u00e9 pour le transport de passagers et ayant une CMC de plus de 39 passagers sans d\u00e9passer 89 passagers. Un \u00ab petit a\u00e9ronef \u00bb est un a\u00e9ronef \u00e9quip\u00e9 pour le transport de passagers et ayant une CMC d\u2019au plus 39 passagers.\n[30] Le capitaine Duke et M. Clark ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019un vol int\u00e9rieur signifiait d\u2019un point \u00e0 un autre du Canada, sur un vol r\u00e9gulier ou non et que l\u2019a\u00e9ronef passe ou non au\u2011dessus des \u00c9.\u2011U. Ils ont \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une destination internationale comportait un vol entre deux villes, une au Canada et l\u2019autre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[31] La Loi sur les transports au Canada (article 55) ainsi que le Guide pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de demandes : Par les transporteurs canadiens pour obtenir une licence en vue d\u2019exploiter un service national ou international \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019OTC d\u00e9finissent le \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb par service a\u00e9rien offert soit \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Canada, soit entre un point qui y est situ\u00e9 et un point qui lui est ext\u00e9rieur sans pour autant faire partie du territoire d\u2019un autre pays, et le \u00ab service international \u00bb par service a\u00e9rien offert entre le Canada et l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Sur le site Recherche de licences d\u2019un transporteur a\u00e9rien (RLTA) de l\u2019OTC, le type de licence \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 un \u00ab service \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Canada \u00bb.\n[32] Au sujet des tailles diverses, M. Clark a fait allusion au site Web Recherche de liste d\u2019exploitants (RLE) de TC qui donnait un aper\u00e7u des divers types d\u2019a\u00e9ronef pour un transporteur a\u00e9rien donn\u00e9 et qui s\u2019en servait comme indication pour d\u00e9terminer les diff\u00e9rents types de transporteurs a\u00e9riens. Le capitaine Duke s\u2019appuyait sur ce que les repr\u00e9sentants des transporteurs a\u00e9riens lui ont dit au sujet des types d\u2019a\u00e9ronef exploit\u00e9s par les transporteurs.\n(ii) Le groupe de comparaison des plaignants (a) \u00c9l\u00e9ments de preuve du capitaine Paul Prentice [33] Le capitaine Prentice fait partie des plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 comme premier officier par Air Canada. Il a pris sa retraite le 1er octobre 2005, soit le premier jour du mois suivant son 60e anniversaire. Durant une p\u00e9riode de sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 Air Canada, soit de 1997 environ \u00e0 2001, il a occup\u00e9 le poste de directeur des op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols. Il est retourn\u00e9 au vol de ligne parce qu\u2019il devait prendre sa retraite environ 18 mois plus tard et voulait redevenir pilote d\u2019a\u00e9ronef.\n[34] Le capitaine Prentice a con\u00e7u trois tableaux. Son premier tableau (C-Tableau 1) intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab \u00c2ge de la retraite des pilotes \u0153uvrant pour des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens \u00bb au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005 combine les activit\u00e9s de chaque compagnie a\u00e9rienne, le nombre total de pilotes, l\u2019\u00e2ge de leur retraite et la politique. Il comprend les rubriques suivantes : transporteur a\u00e9rien, pilotes; \u00e2ge de la retraite, politique en mati\u00e8re de retraite, vols internationaux, passager, fret; sous-partie 705, donn\u00e9es fournies par et coordonn\u00e9es. Il n\u2019existe pas de cat\u00e9gories pour les vols int\u00e9rieurs ou pour les tailles et types divers.\n[35] Le C-Tableau 1 provient de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits du capitaine Prentice, en date du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006, qu\u2019il a soumis \u00e0 la CCDP \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Il a examin\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre la jurisprudence pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) et a dress\u00e9 une liste des compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes, tir\u00e9e du site Web de TC, qu\u2019il jugeait comparables \u00e0 Air Canada. Ces compagnies ont le statut d\u2019entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien dont les activit\u00e9s sont r\u00e9gies par la sous-partie 705 du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019aviation canadien (RAC) et sont titulaires d\u2019un certificat d\u2019exploitation a\u00e9rienne (CEA) \u00e0 l\u2019instar d\u2019Air Canada.\n[36] Il a fourni une liste de neuf transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui comptaient au total 3 090 pilotes contre 3 066 pour Air Canada. Il a obtenu cette information en communiquant avec le personnel cl\u00e9 qu\u2019il connaissait chez ces transporteurs et qui avait acc\u00e8s aux listes d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 indiquant le nombre de pilotes qui occupaient des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. De ces sources, il a \u00e9galement obtenu la confirmation que les pilotes de ces transporteurs a\u00e9riens n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenus de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[37] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada faisait partie de la minorit\u00e9 sur le plan statistique, il n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019autres recherches et il a transmis les renseignements \u00e0 la CCDP.\n[38] Aux fins de l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le capitaine Prentice a poursuivi sa collecte d\u2019information. Il a affirm\u00e9 que la collecte des donn\u00e9es pour le C-Tableau 1 \u00e9tait le fruit d'une d\u00e9marche collective, soit celle d\u2019un groupe de cinq pilotes dont il faisait partie. Dans certains cas, il a re\u00e7u l\u2019information d\u2019autres membres du groupe et, dans d\u2019autres cas, il a fait des recherches sur le site Web. Lorsqu\u2019il indiquait sur le C-Tableau 1 que les donn\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies en ligne, il devait v\u00e9rifier si le transporteur a\u00e9rien avait un site Web. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, lui ou un autre membre du groupe devait communiquer avec le transporteur a\u00e9rien.\n[39] En ce qui concerne les num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone des transporteurs a\u00e9riens figurant sur le tableau, le capitaine Prentice a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il en aurait appel\u00e9 une bonne partie, mais il ne savait pas quels transporteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints par d\u2019autres membres.\n[40] En ce qui concerne le nombre total de pilotes pour chaque transporteur a\u00e9rien, il a obtenu les listes d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada datant du 1er janvier 2006 et les listes des postes occup\u00e9s par les pilotes de Jazz pour 2005. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement report\u00e9 aux annexes A et B de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven qui donnent le nombre de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, de Jazz, d\u2019Air Transat, de CanJet, de Skyservice et de WestJet. Pour les autres transporteurs a\u00e9riens figurant sur le C-tableau 1, lui ou d\u2019autres membres du groupe ont obtenu cette information d\u2019une personne qui avait travaill\u00e9 ou qui travaillait pour le transporteur.\n[41] Le capitaine Prentice croyait que le nombre de pilotes qu\u2019il avait obtenu serait plus pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, parce les listes d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9taient plus stables au cours de la derni\u00e8re partie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Il a donc choisi le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005 comme aper\u00e7u. La collecte de donn\u00e9es mensuelles ou annuelles s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e un cauchemar. Les listes d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes sont tr\u00e8s fluctuantes et il \u00e9tait au-del\u00e0 de ses capacit\u00e9s de recueillir l\u2019information mensuelle ou annuelle. Si le nombre de pilotes se rapprochait des donn\u00e9es qu\u2019il avait acquises, il utilisait les donn\u00e9es de la d\u00e9cision Vilven.\n[42] En ce qui concerne l\u2019[traduction] \u00ab \u00e2ge de la retraite \u00bb figurant sur le C-Tableau 1, le capitaine Prentice a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es tir\u00e9es des expos\u00e9s des faits dans Vilven. Le tableau r\u00e9v\u00e8le que tous les transporteurs a\u00e9riens dont il a dress\u00e9 la liste fixent l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 65 ans. Seule Air Canada fixe l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans. Concernant la [traduction] \u00ab politique en mati\u00e8re de retraite \u00bb figurant sur le C-Tableau 1, une partie des donn\u00e9es provient de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits dans Vilven et, pour le reste des transporteurs a\u00e9riens, les donn\u00e9es peuvent provenir des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques faits chez les transporteurs figurant sur la liste.\n[43] Quant aux transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui figuraient parmi les groupes de comparaison, le C\u2011tableau 1 compte trente-quatre compagnies a\u00e9riennes dont les activit\u00e9s sont r\u00e9gies par la sous\u2011partie 705 et deux compagnies, par la sous\u2011partie 704 (Air Alliance\/Georgian et Air Inuit). Le site Web de TC, partie VII du RAC, d\u00e9finit un CEA aux termes des sous\u2011parties 705 et 704.\n[44] Un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 705, Exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien, est d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un exploitant a\u00e9rien qui utilise un a\u00e9ronef dont la masse maximale homologu\u00e9e au d\u00e9collage (MMHD) est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 19 000 livres et pour lequel un certificat de type canadien a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 autorisant le transport de 20 passagers ou plus.\n[45] Un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 704, Exploitation d\u2019un service a\u00e9rien de navette, est d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un exploitant a\u00e9rien qui utilise un a\u00e9ronef dont la MMHD ne d\u00e9passe pas 19 000 livres et dont la configuration pr\u00e9voit de 10 \u00e0 19 si\u00e8ges inclusivement, sans compter les si\u00e8ges des pilotes.\n[46] Un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 703, Exploitation d\u2019un taxi a\u00e9rien, est d\u00e9livr\u00e9 pour un a\u00e9ronef dont la MMHD ne d\u00e9passe pas 19 000 livres et dont la configuration pr\u00e9voit au plus neuf si\u00e8ges, sans compter les si\u00e8ges des pilotes.\n[47] Le capitaine Prentice a cherch\u00e9 sur le site Web \u00ab Recherche de liste d\u2019exploitants \u2013 RLE \u00bb de TC, en octobre 2009, les transporteurs a\u00e9riens dont les activit\u00e9s sont r\u00e9gies par la sous-partie 705 et il en a obtenu trente-sept. Il a \u00e9galement cherch\u00e9 sur ce site les transporteurs a\u00e9riens dont les activit\u00e9s sont r\u00e9gies par la sous-partie 704 et il en a obtenu quatre-vingt-sept.\n[48] M\u00eame si le capitaine Prentice n\u2019a pas inclus les transporteurs a\u00e9riens relevant de la sous-partie 704 dans le C-Tableau 1 (\u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019Air Alliance et d\u2019Air Inuit), les plaignants affirment que ces transporteurs a\u00e9riens satisfont au crit\u00e8re du groupe de comparaison. Ils veulent que le Tribunal tienne compte de ces transporteurs comme groupes de comparaison de r\u00e9serve si un probl\u00e8me se pose du point de vue des chiffres appuyant leur position.\n[49] Le capitaine Prentice a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec les transporteurs a\u00e9riens de la sous-partie 704 et les plaignants n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune analyse au-del\u00e0 des renseignements figurant sur le site Web de TC pour d\u00e9montrer que ces transporteurs appartenaient au groupe de comparaison. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur le nombre de postes de pilote de ces transporteurs, mis \u00e0 part l\u2019estimation fournie par le capitaine Prentice, qui repose sur son exp\u00e9rience au sein de l\u2019industrie, \u00e0 savoir que vous avez besoin d\u2019au moins 1 500 pilotes pour que ces transporteurs a\u00e9riens continuent de fonctionner.\n[50] En ce qui a trait aux [traduction] \u00ab vols internationaux \u00bb, le capitaine Prentice a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait consult\u00e9 le site Web du transporteur a\u00e9rien pour voir s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une entreprise d\u2019affr\u00e8tement. Si lui ou un des autres pilotes qui l\u2019aidaient ne trouvaient rien \u00e0 ce sujet sur le site Web, alors, ils communiquaient avec le transporteur. Le capitaine Prentice incluait dans le groupe de comparaison les transporteurs a\u00e9riens s\u2019ils effectuaient effectivement des vols internationaux et r\u00e9guliers ou des vols d\u2019affr\u00e8tement ou encore, s\u2019ils d\u00e9tenaient une licence ou s\u2019ils \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9s et aptes \u00e0 le faire.\n[51] Il a pos\u00e9 la question suivante aux responsables des transporteurs a\u00e9riens qu\u2019il a joints au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone : s\u2019il voulait affr\u00e9ter un a\u00e9ronef \u00e0 destination des \u00c9tats-Unis, pouvaient-ils le faire? C\u2019\u00e9tait en 2009. Il n\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 de questions concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005. Il ne pouvait mentionner les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es par les autres membres du groupe. Donc, toutes les donn\u00e9es figurant sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab vols internationaux \u00bb du C-tableau 1 sont celles de 2009.\n[52] Le capitaine Prentice n\u2019a inclus dans le C-Tableau 1 aucune cat\u00e9gorie relative aux divers types ou tailles d\u2019a\u00e9ronef et n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 la raison pour laquelle ce facteur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte.\n[53] La conclusion que le capitaine Prentice a tir\u00e9e du C-Tableau 1 est que le nombre de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison, au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005, s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 5 350, comparativement \u00e0 3 037 pour Air Canada. Exprim\u00e9 en pourcentage, le nombre total de pilotes du groupe de comparaison repr\u00e9sente 63,8 % du nombre total de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n(iii) Conclusion concernant le C-Tableau 1 et l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite [54] \u00c0 mon avis, des probl\u00e8mes se posent si les plaignants s\u2019appuient sur le C-Tableau 1 du capitaine Prentice pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le capitaine, le C-Tableau 1 donne un aper\u00e7u de la situation au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Mais certains des chiffres relatifs aux pilotes sont tir\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven qui datent de 2006. Les autres chiffres relatifs aux pilotes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus par le capitaine Prentice ou par ses coll\u00e8gues ayant communiqu\u00e9 avec les transporteurs a\u00e9riens en 2009. Les donn\u00e9es relatives aux vols internationaux remontent \u00e0 2009. Ainsi, le C-Tableau 1 est un hybride des donn\u00e9es de 2005, de 2006 et de 2009, mais est cens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter la situation telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en d\u00e9cembre 2005.\n[55] Comme dernier point, mais non le moindre, le capitaine Prentice a \u00e9labor\u00e9 sa propre formule quant aux facteurs qui devraient servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le groupe de comparaison. Il n\u2019inclut que deux des cinq volets d\u00e9finis par la Cour. J\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les cinq volets devraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer le groupe en question. M\u00eame si le paragraphe 170 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour dicte la conduite \u00e0 suivre, les facteurs mis de l\u2019avant par le capitaine ne concordent pas. Il peut \u00eatre possible de s\u2019\u00e9loigner quelque peu de la formulation de la Cour, mais il doit y avoir certaines raisons qui le justifient. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y en a aucune, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019inspire de sa pr\u00e9sentation initiale \u00e0 la CCDP. Il s\u2019agit peut-\u00eatre d\u2019une explication, mais ce n\u2019est pas une justification.\n[56] Pour ces motifs, je ne peux pas admettre son C-Tableau 1 comme base pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite.\n[57] Le capitaine Prentice a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me tableau, soit le [traduction] \u00ab Tableau des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens, facteurs s\u2019appliquant aux groupes de comparaison, 2005 \u00e0 2009 \u00bb. Les plaignants ont soumis ce tableau comme contre-preuve. Il r\u00e9pond au R-tableau 1 du capitaine Duke ainsi qu\u2019au R-tableau 2 de M. Clark. Ce que le capitaine Prentice a fait, c\u2019est d\u2019indiquer, pour chaque transporteur a\u00e9rien, sous chacun des cinq volets, lorsque sa conclusion diff\u00e9rait de celle de M. Clark et du capitaine Duke.\n[58] En \u00e9laborant le C-Tableau 2, le capitaine Prentice a eu recours \u00e0 des d\u00e9finitions dans son application du crit\u00e8re qui diff\u00e9raient de celles du capitaine Duke et de M. Clark. Les diff\u00e9rences avaient trait principalement aux vols int\u00e9rieurs et internationaux, et aux tailles diverses. Quant au type, s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un mod\u00e8le diff\u00e9rent d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, ainsi qu\u2019il est montr\u00e9 sur le site Web \u00ab RLE \u00bb ou sur le site Web du transporteur, le capitaine Prentice devait consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un type diff\u00e9rent.\n[59] En ce qui concerne les tailles diverses, il n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 les cat\u00e9gories \u00ab petit, moyen ou gros \u00bb de l\u2019OTC, selon le nombre maximum de passagers autoris\u00e9s. Il s\u2019est plut\u00f4t appuy\u00e9 sur la masse maximale fournie par la RLE de TC.\n[60] Notamment, s\u2019il y avait une diff\u00e9rence de poids exc\u00e9dant 500 lb, le capitaine Prentice consid\u00e9rait les a\u00e9ronefs comme \u00e9tant d\u2019une taille diff\u00e9rente. Il a affirm\u00e9 que sa ligne de d\u00e9marcation ne reposait sur aucun document officiel, mais plut\u00f4t sur la logique. Il a donn\u00e9 l\u2019exemple d\u2019un BE100 de 11 500 lb et d\u2019un BE99 de 11 000 lb. Il s\u2019agirait de types diff\u00e9rents d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, mais non de taille diff\u00e9rente. Un BE100 de 11 500 lb et un DHC8 de 34 500 lb seraient des types diff\u00e9rents d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, de taille diff\u00e9rente.\n[61] En ce qui concerne la question des vols internationaux, le capitaine Prentice s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur la RLTA pour d\u00e9terminer si un transporteur a\u00e9rien est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer des vols internationaux. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement fond\u00e9 sur le site Web du transporteur et sur l\u2019information obtenue par courriel de repr\u00e9sentants des compagnies a\u00e9riennes. S\u2019il ne pouvait obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur le site Web ou en communiquant avec le transporteur, il devait compter uniquement sur la RLTA.\n[62] Il devait d\u00e9terminer pour les vols internationaux si le transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer des vols nolis\u00e9s internationaux ou s\u2019il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer des vols internationaux, et s\u2019il \u00e9tait capable et d\u00e9sireux de fournir une estimation du tarif a\u00e9rien pour un vol nolis\u00e9 international et d\u2019assurer le service.\n(iv) Tableaux combin\u00e9s des groupes de comparaison [63] J\u2019ai regroup\u00e9 dans un seul tableau les R-tableau 1, R-tableau 2 et C-tableau 2, qui met en \u00e9vidence uniquement les transporteurs a\u00e9riens pour lesquels les parties ne sont pas d\u2019accord en ce qui concerne l\u2019observation ou non du crit\u00e8re et les raisons de leurs divergences.\n[64] Le capitaine Duke : Air Transat : Question : Service int\u00e9rieur : non Taille : non Source de donn\u00e9es : t\u00e9moignage de Anne Bujold, conseill\u00e8re en ressources humaines. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Transat est un exploitant de vols d\u2019affr\u00e8tement de vacanciers qui a effectu\u00e9 de 2005 \u00e0 2009 des vols r\u00e9guliers vers 60 destinations en Europe, dans les Cara\u00efbes, au Mexique, aux \u00c9tats-Unis et en Am\u00e9rique du Sud. Elle a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Transat n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 aucun Service int\u00e9rieur de 2005 \u00e0 2009. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, le transporteur a\u00e9rien avait deux types d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, soit le A310 et le A330. Ce sont de gros a\u00e9ronefs.\n[65] M. Clark : Air Transat pour 2009 : comme ci-dessus. De plus, M. Clark a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9server un vol sur Air Transat de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Toronto, de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Vancouver et de Toronto \u00e0 Vancouver et n\u2019a pu le faire. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Transat n\u2019offre pas le service entre une ville canadienne et une autre.\n[66] Le capitaine Prentice : Air Transat : Question : Service int\u00e9rieur : oui Taille : oui Source de donn\u00e9es : site Web de l\u2019OTC, Recherche de licences d\u2019un transporteur a\u00e9rien (RLTA, 2009). Cela indique qu\u2019Air Transat d\u00e9tient une licence pour l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un service int\u00e9rieur. Il a \u00e9galement produit un avis de changement d\u2019horaire de Nolitours, en date de novembre 2009, qui indique un vol effectu\u00e9 par Air Transat de Puerto Vallarta \u00e0 Toronto, ainsi qu\u2019une lettre de Janet Brock, propri\u00e9taire de Voyage Plus (2009), qui mentionne qu\u2019Air Transat effectue souvent des liaisons entre des villes canadiennes pour acheminer des passagers vers des destinations internationales. Le capitaine Prentice s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019Air Transat dessert des destinations int\u00e9rieures. Le Registre d\u2019immatriculation des a\u00e9ronefs civils canadiens de TC (2010) (RIACC) relatif \u00e0 Air Transat indique que le transporteur exploite les A310-300, A330-243 et A330-342.\n[67] Le capitaine Duke : SkyService : Question : Service int\u00e9rieur : non Taille : non Source de donn\u00e9es : directeur, Planification et \u00e9tablissement des horaires. SkyService a cess\u00e9 les vols int\u00e9rieurs de passagers en 2005. De 2005 \u00e0 2008, Skyservice a utilis\u00e9 trois tailles d\u2019a\u00e9ronef : le B757 et les A320 et A330. Selon la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019OTC, il s\u2019agit tous de gros a\u00e9ronefs.\n[68] M. Clark : Skyservice pour 2009 : comme ci-dessus sauf pour la source de donn\u00e9es : t\u00e9moignage de Phillip Goss. M. Goss est un sp\u00e9cialiste des ressources humaines chez Skyservice. Skyservice \u00e9tait un exploitant de services de nolisement avec lequel les organisateurs de voyages concluaient des contrats aux termes desquels ces derniers devaient fournir l\u2019a\u00e9ronef alors que Skyservice fournissait l\u2019\u00e9quipage \u00e0 bord, soit les pilotes et les agents de bord. Actuellement, Skyservice ne dessert pas les destinations int\u00e9rieures. Lorsque M. Goss est entr\u00e9 au service de Skyservice en 2007, la compagnie offrait exclusivement des vols internationaux, mais \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir des vols internationaux ainsi que des vols int\u00e9rieurs. En 2009, Skyservice disposait de 16 a\u00e9ronefs qui lui \u00e9taient fournis et d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef dont elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire.

Sur son site Web, la compagnie indique qu\u2019elle utilise les a\u00e9ronefs suivants : BE300, DCH100-400 et CRJ200.\n[147] Le capitaine Prentice : Regional 1 Airlines : Question : Type : oui Source de donn\u00e9es : RLE de TC (2009) : le site affiche les a\u00e9ronefs suivants : BE300\/350, 14 000 lb; DHC100-400 34 500 lb, RAC 703 et 705.\n[148] Le capitaine Duke : Transwest Air : Question : Service international : non Taille : non Source de donn\u00e9es : chef pilote. La flotte de la compagnie est compos\u00e9e de SF-34, BE\u201119 et DH-6, qui sont tous de petits a\u00e9ronefs. Le chef pilote lui a \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 que la compagnie n\u2019offrait pas de vols internationaux pendant la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008.\n[149] M. Clark : Transwest Air pour 2009 : Question : comme ci-dessus. Source de donn\u00e9es : pi\u00e8ce R-8, onglet 34. Le site Web de la compagnie (2009) indique que Transwest Air exploite les a\u00e9ronefs suivants : SF340, capacit\u00e9 de 34 si\u00e8ges; BE1900, capacit\u00e9 de 19 si\u00e8ges; Jetstream 3100, capacit\u00e9 de 16 si\u00e8ges; KingAir 200, capacit\u00e9 de sept si\u00e8ges; DHC6, capacit\u00e9 de 12 \u00e0 15 si\u00e8ges; DHC3, capacit\u00e9 de neuf si\u00e8ges, DHC2, capacit\u00e9 de cinq ou six si\u00e8ges; Piper Navajo, capacit\u00e9 de sept si\u00e8ges; Cessna 185, capacit\u00e9 de trois si\u00e8ges. Sa page sur les destinations indique que la compagnie dessert le Manitoba, la Saskatchewan et l\u2019Alberta.\n[150] Le capitaine Prentice : Transwest Air : Question : Service international : oui Taille : oui Source de donn\u00e9es : RLTA de l\u2019OTC 2009. Le site indique que la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international \u00e0 la demande. La RLE de TC (2010) affiche les a\u00e9ronefs suivants : BE100, 11 500 lb; BE1900, 17 000 lb; BE200, 12 500 lb; BE55, 5 300 lb; BE99 1 100 lb; RAC 702, 703 et 704. Il semble ressortir du site Web de la compagnie (2010) que Transwest Air poss\u00e8de la plus grande flotte d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 voilure fixe et \u00e0 voilure tournante en Saskatchewan et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9tabli un service de l\u2019affr\u00e8tement \u00e0 Lynn Lake, au Manitoba. La compagnie peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous vos besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019affr\u00e8tement \u00e0 un prix abordable.\n[151] Le capitaine Duke : Wasaya Airways : Question : Taille : non Source de donn\u00e9es : courriel du directeur, Op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes. Selon le courriel, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008, Wasaya Airways assurait des vols nolis\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers et des vols nolis\u00e9s internationaux ponctuels. La compagnie exploite les a\u00e9ronefs HS748, BE1900, PC12 et C208 qui sont tous de petits a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 l\u2019exception du HS748 qui est de taille moyenne, mais qui ne sert qu\u2019au transport du fret.\n[152] M. Clark : Wasaya Airways pour 2009 : Question : Service international : non Taille : non Source de donn\u00e9es : pi\u00e8ce R\u20118, onglet 35. La page \u00ab Where We Fly \u00bb du site Web de la compagnie (2009) : indique que la compagnie a\u00e9rienne ne dessert que le Manitoba et l\u2019Ontario. La flotte de la compagnie comprend les a\u00e9ronefs suivants : BE1900, capacit\u00e9 de 18 si\u00e8ges; Caravan 208, capacit\u00e9 de neuf si\u00e8ges; PilatusPC12, capacit\u00e9 de neuf si\u00e8ges; PilatusPC9, 9 900 lb; RAC 703, 704 et 705.\n[153] Le capitaine Prentice : Wasaya Airways : Question : Service international : oui Taille : oui Source de donn\u00e9es : RLTA de l\u2019OTC (2009). Le site indique que la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international \u00e0 la demande.

Courriel de novembre 2009 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Dr Kelly par le repr\u00e9sentant, Ventes et marketing des vols nolis\u00e9s, de Wasaya. Le courriel avise que la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer des vols nolis\u00e9s \u00e0 destination des \u00c9.-U. et qu\u2019elle peut fournir une estimation du tarif a\u00e9rien pour un affr\u00e8tement pour voyage de groupe, et qu\u2019elle le fait \u00e0 la condition de recevoir un pr\u00e9avis appropri\u00e9 aux fins de d\u00e9douanement.\n[154] Le capitaine Duke : Westwind : r\u00e9pond au crit\u00e8re pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008.\n[155] M. Clark : Westwind pour 2009 : Question : Service international : non Source de donn\u00e9es : pi\u00e8ce R-14, onglet 36. Site Web de la compagnie (2009) : le site mentionne que Westwind ne dessert que trois collectivit\u00e9s en Saskatchewan.\n[156] Le capitaine Prentice : Westwind : Question : Service international : oui Source de donn\u00e9es : RLTA (2010). Le site indique que la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international, mais il ne semble pas que cette derni\u00e8re assure des vols internationaux ou qu\u2019elle est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire ou qu\u2019elle est en mesure de le faire.\n[157] Harmony Airline et Zoom Airline : le capitaine Duke et M. Clark n\u2019ont pas inscrit Harmony Airline ou Zoom Airline sur le R-Tableau-1 ou le R-Tableau-2. Cependant, les intim\u00e9es ont ult\u00e9rieurement inclus les deux compagnies a\u00e9riennes dans les groupes de comparaison pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2007, dans le cas d\u2019Harmony Airline, et pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008, dans le cas de Zoom Airline. Harmony a cess\u00e9 d\u2019exploiter apr\u00e8s 2007 et Zoom apr\u00e8s 2008.\n(v) Quelles compagnies a\u00e9riennes devraient \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison? [158] Il s\u2019agit maintenant de d\u00e9terminer quelles compagnies a\u00e9riennes figurant dans les tableaux combin\u00e9s des groupes de comparaison doivent faire partie du groupe de comparaison r\u00e9pondant au crit\u00e8re. Mais auparavant, deux questions pr\u00e9liminaires doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es.\n[159] Premi\u00e8rement, comment doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9finis les termes \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb, \u00ab service international \u00bb ainsi que \u00ab tailles diverses \u00bb? J\u2019ai conclu en m\u2019appuyant sur la preuve que le \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb signifie un service a\u00e9rien offert \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Canada ou entre des endroits situ\u00e9s au Canada. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que les plaignants, dans leur argument de l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ), pr\u00e9tendent que la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite ne s\u2019applique pas aux vols \u00ab int\u00e9rieurs \u00bb d\u2019Air Canada. Ils affirment qu\u2019un vol qui survole l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger est int\u00e9rieur du moment que l\u2019a\u00e9ronef d\u00e9colle du Canada et y atterrit. J\u2019accepte que le crit\u00e8re fasse r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux destinations canadiennes, mais je n\u2019admets pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation propos\u00e9e par les plaignants selon laquelle un vol effectu\u00e9 par une compagnie a\u00e9rienne canadienne de New York \u00e0 Toronto satisfait au volet \u00ab int\u00e9rieur \u00bb du crit\u00e8re.\n[160] De m\u00eame, une compagnie a\u00e9rienne canadienne qui effectue un vol nolis\u00e9 entre une ville canadienne et une destination internationale ou qui prend des passagers dans une autre ville canadienne pour les amener vers une destination internationale ne satisfait pas au volet \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb du crit\u00e8re.\n[161] Au sujet de la question de savoir si une compagnie a\u00e9rienne dessert des destinations internationales, le crit\u00e8re fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux pilotes \u0153uvrant pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes qui desservent des destinations internationales. J\u2019accepte l\u2019approche du capitaine Prentice \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la notion de service international. \u00c0 mon avis, si une compagnie effectue des vols internationaux ou est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire, et fournit des estimations de tarif a\u00e9rien pour un vol nolis\u00e9 international sur demande et assure ce vol, cela est suffisant pour satisfaire au volet \u00ab service international \u00bb du crit\u00e8re.\n[162] En ce qui concerne les tailles diverses, les intim\u00e9es s\u2019appuient sur les cat\u00e9gories \u00ab petit, moyen ou gros \u00bb de l\u2019OTC, selon la capacit\u00e9 en si\u00e8ges de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef. Les plaignants se fondent sur la masse maximale de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, un \u00e9cart de 500 lb est la mesure utilis\u00e9e par le capitaine Prentice pour diff\u00e9rencier les tailles des a\u00e9ronefs. Il n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il a choisi cette mesure comme ligne de d\u00e9marcation.\n[163] Selon le Guide pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de demandes : Par les transporteurs canadiens pour obtenir une licence en vue d\u2019exploiter un service national ou international \u00e0 la demande, l\u2019exploitant doit d\u00e9tenir un certificat d\u2019exploitation a\u00e9rienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la classification du service qui sera fourni au titre de la licence. Cette classification est d\u00e9finie en fonction de la taille de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, petit, moyen et gros.\n[164] Les sous-parties 704 et 705 de la partie VII du RAC (sur lesquels s\u2019appuient les plaignants) classent les a\u00e9ronefs en fonction de leur MMHD et de leur configuration des si\u00e8ges. Ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans cette d\u00e9cision, un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 705 vise un a\u00e9ronef ayant une MMHD pr\u00e9cise et une configuration des si\u00e8ges autoris\u00e9s pour le transport de 20 passagers ou plus. Un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 704 vise un a\u00e9ronef ayant une MMHD pr\u00e9cise et dont la configuration pr\u00e9voit de 10 \u00e0 19 si\u00e8ges inclusivement. Un certificat r\u00e9gi par la sous-partie 703 vise un a\u00e9ronef ayant une MMHD pr\u00e9cise et dont la configuration pr\u00e9voit au plus neuf si\u00e8ges.\n[165] Il est \u00e9galement int\u00e9ressant de se reporter \u00e0 la clause 1.01.06 de la convention collective conclue entre Air Canada et l\u2019APAC, qui classe la taille des a\u00e9ronefs en fonction de la capacit\u00e9 en si\u00e8ges afin de restreindre la taille de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef pouvant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 par des transporteurs a\u00e9riens d\u2019apport.\n[166] Ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences indiquent que, pour diff\u00e9rentes fins dans l\u2019industrie du transport a\u00e9rien, la capacit\u00e9 en si\u00e8ges ou la configuration d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef est la mesure la plus courante ind\u00e9pendamment de la masse d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef. \u00c0 mon avis, cela devrait \u00eatre la base qui permet de d\u00e9terminer les diverses tailles.\n[167] La deuxi\u00e8me question consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelles sont les ann\u00e9es pertinentes pour d\u00e9terminer les groupes de comparaison et l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite. Les intim\u00e9es ont fourni des donn\u00e9es pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009. Le C-Tableau 2 des plaignants indique apparemment qu\u2019il couvre les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009.\n[168] Mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Le capitaine Prentice a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait inclus 36 des 39 transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens figurant sur ce tableau dans le groupe de comparaison. Il l\u2019a fait pour chacun des transporteurs a\u00e9riens, si \u00e0 tout moment au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009, ces compagnies satisfaisaient au crit\u00e8re. Il a reconnu que cela ne signifie pas que le crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9 pour chacune de ces ann\u00e9es.\n[169] Il ressort des tableaux combin\u00e9s des groupes de comparaison que, en \u00e9laborant le C\u2011tableau 2, le capitaine Prentice s\u2019est fond\u00e9 (les quelques exceptions \u00e9tant les donn\u00e9es de 2010) sur les donn\u00e9es de 2009. Ainsi, le C-tableau 2 est une repr\u00e9sentation des faits tels qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient en 2009.\n[170] Toutefois, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse statistique relative au nombre de pilotes et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite dans le [traduction] \u00ab tableau des statistiques sur l\u2019emploi des pilotes des groupes de comparaison au 1er janvier 2006, en fonction des r\u00e9ponses : 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009 \u00bb, fourni par les plaignants, le capitaine Prentice a utilis\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es uniquement pour 2006.\n[171] Ainsi, dans le cas des plaignants, les donn\u00e9es relatives aux groupes de comparaison sont globales et celles concernant le nombre de pilotes et l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite sont pour 2006. Les parties ont fourni des donn\u00e9es portant sur le nombre de pilotes et l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite pour l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode, soit de 2005 \u00e0 2009.\n(vi) Conclusion sur les transporteurs a\u00e9riens comparables P\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008\n[172] \u00c0 mon avis, les conclusions tir\u00e9es du C-Tableau 2 et la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, qui reposent sur les donn\u00e9es de 2009, ne peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour les ann\u00e9es de 2005 \u00e0 2008. Seule la preuve qui rend compte des faits pour ces ann\u00e9es peut \u00eatre prise en compte et celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par le capitaine Duke.\n[173] Ainsi, j\u2019ai conclu que, en me fondant sur la preuve du capitaine Duke, telle qu\u2019elle est expos\u00e9e dans le tableau combin\u00e9 des groupes de comparaison, ainsi que sur mes d\u00e9finitions du \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb, \u00ab du service international \u00bb et de la \u00ab taille \u00bb, les transporteurs a\u00e9riens suivants remplissent les conditions pour faire partie des groupes de comparaison pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2008 :\n\u27a2 Jazz - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 First Air - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Kelowna Flightcraft - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour 2005 et 2006.\n\u27a2 Voyageur - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Air Inuit - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Canadian North - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour 2007 et 2008.\n\u27a2 Air North Charter - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Air Tindi - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Nolinor - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour 2008.\n\u27a2 Westwind - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019ensemble des ann\u00e9es.\n\u27a2 Harmony - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour 2005 \u00e0 2007.\n\u27a2 Zoom - Satisfait au crit\u00e8re pour 2005 \u00e0 2008.\nAnn\u00e9e 2009\n[174] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, en me reportant \u00e0 la preuve du capitaine Prentice et de M. Clark, telle qu\u2019elle est expos\u00e9e dans le tableau combin\u00e9 des groupes de comparaison, j\u2019ai dress\u00e9 la liste des transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui remplissent les conditions pour faire partie des groupes de comparaison et de ceux qui ne les remplissent pas tout en pr\u00e9cisant les raisons qui s\u2019y rapportent.\n\u27a2 Jazz \u2013 Oui. Satisfait au crit\u00e8re.\n\u27a2 Air Transat \u2013 Non. Ne correspond pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du \u00ab service int\u00e9rieur \u00bb.

Un courriel de la compagnie avise qu\u2019elle n\u2019effectue pas de vols internationaux.\n\u27a2 Air Inuit \u2013 Non. Le site Web de la compagnie mentionne qu\u2019elle ne dessert que le Canada et, m\u00eame si elle est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international, il ne semble pas que ce soit le cas ou qu\u2019elle soit dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire et qu\u2019elle soit en mesure de le faire.\n\u27a2 Canadian North - Oui.

Clark ne permettent pas de savoir quel est le mod\u00e8le exploit\u00e9 par la compagnie. La RLE affiche diff\u00e9rentes tailles d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, soit des a\u00e9ronefs de petite taille et de taille moyenne.\n\u27a2 Pacific Coastal - Non. N\u2019exploite qu\u2019une seule taille d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, soit les petits a\u00e9ronefs. La compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international, mais elle ne semble pas fournir ce service. Le site Web de la compagnie indique le contraire.\n\u27a2 Perimeter Aviation - Non. La compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international, mais elle ne semble pas fournir ce service. Le site Web de la compagnie indique le contraire.\n\u27a2 Prince Edward Air - Non. La compagnie exploite de petits a\u00e9ronefs. CargoJet a fait l\u2019acquisition de la compagnie en 2009 et a mis fin aux vols de passagers.\n\u27a2 Provincial Airlines - Non. N\u2019exploite que de petits a\u00e9ronefs.\n\u27a2 Regional 1 Airlines - Oui. Satisfait au crit\u00e8re. Exploite divers types d\u2019a\u00e9ronef.\n\u27a2 Transwest Air - Non. N\u2019exploite que de petits a\u00e9ronefs et, m\u00eame si la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 offrir un service international, il ne semble pas que ce soit le cas ou qu\u2019elle soit dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire et en mesure de le faire.\n\u27a2 Wasaya Airways - Non. N\u2019exploite que de petits a\u00e9ronefs.\n\u27a2 West Wind Aviation - Non. Il ne semble pas que la compagnie offre un service international ou qu\u2019elle soit dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire et en mesure de le faire.\n\u27a2 Harmony - Non. N\u2019\u00e9tait pas en exploitation en 2009.\n\u27a2 Zoom - Non. N\u2019\u00e9tait pas en exploitation en 2009.\n(vii) Conclusion sur l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite [175] Ainsi que l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven, la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite oblige \u00e0 soumettre \u00e0 une analyse statistique le d\u00e9nombrement total des emplois similaires. Pour d\u00e9terminer le nombre total de pilotes pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009, je me suis appuy\u00e9 sur le[traduction] \u00ab sondage: l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite des pilotes \u00bb qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise aux parties par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes.\n[176] En 2005, Air Canada employait 3 037 pilotes qui \u00e9taient tous assujettis \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Le nombre total de pilotes qui travaillaient pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison en 2005 s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 1 876. Le nombre total de pilotes qui travaillaient pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes en 2005 \u00e9tait de 4 913. Statistiquement, les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada repr\u00e9sentaient 61,8 % de tous les pilotes de compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes occupant des postes similaires \u00e0 ceux des plaignants.\n[177] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, le nombre total de pilotes \u00e0 Air Canada s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 3 182. Pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison, le nombre total de pilotes \u00e9tait de 1 853 pour un total de 5 035 pilotes. Ce nombre repr\u00e9sentait 63 % de tous les pilotes de compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes occupant des postes similaires.\n[178] En 2007, 3 308 pilotes travaillaient chez Air Canada. Le nombre de pilotes des transporteurs a\u00e9riens du groupe de comparaison s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 2 120. Au total, le nombre de pilotes des compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes \u00e9tait de 5 428 et Air Canada repr\u00e9sentait 61,4 % du total.\n[179] En 2008, Air Canada employait 3 327 pilotes. Le nombre de pilotes du groupe de comparaison totalisait 2 175, ce qui donne au total 5 502 pilotes, Air Canada repr\u00e9sentant 60,5 % du nombre total de pilotes.\n[180] Pour 2009, le nombre total de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 3 204. Le nombre total de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison \u00e9tait de 1 982, en 2009. Le nombre total de pilotes employ\u00e9s par Air Canada et les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison en 2009 \u00e9tait de 5 186 dont 61,85 % \u00e9taient des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[181] En supposant, sans trancher la question, que la retraite \u00e9tait obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans ou plus ou encore, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun \u00e2ge de retraite obligatoire pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009 au sein des compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison, la preuve d\u00e9montre n\u00e9anmoins que, pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009, la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes \u0153uvrant pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes, y compris Air Canada, dans des postes similaires \u00e0 ceux des plaignants, ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Il faut en conclure que 60 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009.\n[182] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 cette conclusion, la retraite obligatoire impos\u00e9e aux plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective conclue entre les intim\u00e9es en raison de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, ne constitue pas une pratique discriminatoire.\nC. Alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP (viii) Rodney Stone [183] M. Stone occupe le poste de directeur, Op\u00e9rations et contr\u00f4le de la circulation a\u00e9rienne, chez Air Canada. Il est un r\u00e9gulateur de vol agr\u00e9\u00e9. Air Canada compte 70 r\u00e9gulateurs de vol dont les principales t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s consistent \u00e0 \u00e9laborer un plan de vol exploitation pour chaque vol effectu\u00e9 par Air Canada. Un a\u00e9ronef ne peut se d\u00e9placer sans qu\u2019un plan de vol exploitation ne soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019organisme de contr\u00f4le de la circulation a\u00e9rienne \u00e0 titre de plan de vol Organisation de l\u2019aviation civile internationale (OACI).\n[184] Le plan de vol comprendra les renseignements tels que l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de vol, les calculs de masse, la quantit\u00e9 de carburant n\u00e9cessaire, les notations \u00e9lectroniques, etc. Le plan de vol est con\u00e7u trois ou quatre heures environ avant le d\u00e9part. Plusieurs m\u00e9thodes permettent de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019itin\u00e9raire et la majorit\u00e9 d\u2019entre elles reposent sur l\u2019analyse des vents en route. Les co\u00fbts de survol sont \u00e9galement pris en compte. En ce qui concerne le vol outre-mer, trente \u00e0 quarante sc\u00e9narios peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9s afin de choisir celui qui est appropri\u00e9 pour ce vol particulier ce jour-l\u00e0.\n[185] Air Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une liste de 34 pays de destination qui ont tous besoin que des survols soient effectu\u00e9s ou qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9vu des a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement de destination ou d\u2019a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement en route. Le survol signifie qu\u2019un vol d\u2019Air Canada utilise l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien d\u2019autres pays pour se rendre \u00e0 destination. M. Stone a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de destinations pour lesquelles un a\u00e9ronef d\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a pas \u00e0 survoler les \u00c9tats-Unis ou \u00e0 utiliser un a\u00e9roport de d\u00e9gagement am\u00e9ricain. Qui plus est, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, m\u00eame pour des destinations au Canada, il arrive qu\u2019un vol d\u2019Air Canada doive survoler l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien am\u00e9ricain.\n[186] Une fois que la version finale du plan de vol est \u00e9tablie, une copie du plan produite par ordinateur est remise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite. Le plan est \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019organisme de contr\u00f4le de la circulation a\u00e9rienne (ATC) appropri\u00e9. L\u2019ATC donne habituellement une autorisation qui fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9cho au plan de vol d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ATC. De nombreux organismes ATC estiment que le plan de vol est un contrat pass\u00e9 entre l\u2019ATC et Air Canada, de sorte que des changements minimes seront accept\u00e9s.\n[187] L\u2019ATC acceptera que des changements mineurs soient apport\u00e9s \u00e0 un itin\u00e9raire. Il arrive que le transporteur demande \u00e0 l\u2019ATC des itin\u00e9raires tenant compte des conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques en route. L\u2019espace a\u00e9rien militaire est une autre situation pour laquelle l\u2019ATC peut modifier le plan de vol. Mis \u00e0 part les situations d\u2019urgence, M. Stone n\u2019a pu se souvenir d\u2019autres situations o\u00f9 le capitaine pouvait obtenir un autre trajet de l\u2019ATC.\n(ix) Samuel Elfassy [188] M. Elfassy occupe actuellement le poste de directeur principal, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et environnement, chez Air Canada o\u00f9 il travaille depuis 22 ans. Dans son poste pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent comme gestionnaire, Affaires r\u00e9glementaires pour les op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes, il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019application des normes et recommandations de l\u2019OACI dans la mesure o\u00f9 celles-ci s\u2019appliquaient aux op\u00e9rations d\u2019Air Canada. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom des intim\u00e9es.\n[189] L\u2019OACI a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1948 aux termes de la Convention relative \u00e0 l\u2019aviation civile internationale conclue \u00e0 Chicago. La Convention avait pour but d\u2019harmoniser les normes relatives aux op\u00e9rations de l\u2019aviation civile internationale. Le Canada est un \u00c9tat contractant et signataire de la Convention. On d\u00e9nombre 190 \u00c9tats contractants de la Convention et, selon la liste des destinations d\u2019Air Canada, cette derni\u00e8re dessert 34 de ces \u00c9tats. Selon M. Elfassy, six de ces \u00c9tats, \u00e0 savoir les \u00eeles Ca\u00efmans, les Bermudes, la Guadeloupe, la Cor\u00e9e, Sainte\u2011Lucie et les \u00eeles Turks et Caicos, ne sont pas signataires de la Convention.\n[190] M. Elfassy a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1 de la Convention qui fixe les normes relatives \u00e0 la reconnaissance internationale des licences des membres d\u2019un \u00e9quipage de vol. Avant le 23 novembre 2006, l\u2019art. 2.1.10.1 de l\u2019annexe 1 pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant ayant d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une licence de pilote ne devait pas autoriser le titulaire de cette licence, si ce dernier avait atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, \u00e0 faire fonction de commandant de bord d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef qui assure des services a\u00e9riens internationaux r\u00e9guliers et des transports a\u00e9riens non r\u00e9guliers contre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou en vertu d\u2019un contrat de location.\n[191] Dans le cas des copilotes, il s\u2019agissait seulement d\u2019une recommandation, non d\u2019une norme. Cette recommandation, aux termes de l\u2019art. 2.1.10.2, pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant ayant d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une licence de pilote ne devait pas autoriser le titulaire de cette licence, si ce dernier avait atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, \u00e0 faire fonction de copilote d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef qui assure des services a\u00e9riens internationaux r\u00e9guliers et des transports a\u00e9riens non r\u00e9guliers contre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou en vertu d\u2019un contrat de location.\n[192] Le 10 mars 2006, l\u2019OACI a apport\u00e9 des modifications \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1, modifications qui ont pris effet le 23 novembre 2006 et qui pr\u00e9voient qu\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant ayant d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une licence de pilote ne doit pas permettre au titulaire de cette licence de remplir les fonctions de commandant de bord d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef qui effectue des vols de transport commercial international apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, ou de 65 ans dans le cas de vols avec plus d\u2019un pilote et si l\u2019autre pilote a moins de 60 ans. La limite d\u2019\u00e2ge sup\u00e9rieure pour les copilotes a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e \u00e0 65 ans, mais sinon la recommandation de l\u2019OACI est demeur\u00e9e la m\u00eame.\n[193] Sur le plan pratique, l\u2019effet est le suivant. Un commandant de bord \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans ou plus, mais de moins de 65 ans, s\u2019il est accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un autre pilote, ne peut \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9, en raison de son \u00e2ge, de piloter un a\u00e9ronef dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien d\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant de l\u2019OACI, du moment que l\u2019autre pilote est \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans (la \u00ab r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI \u00bb).\n[194] Il y a \u00e9galement la question des \u00e9quipages renforc\u00e9s. Selon l\u2019OACI, dans le transport a\u00e9rien commercial sur de grandes distances, l\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite d\u00e9sign\u00e9 peut \u00eatre renforc\u00e9 et compter trois ou quatre pilotes, et m\u00eame plus. L\u2019intention de l\u2019art. 2.1.10.1 est de faire en sorte que, lorsque le commandant de bord a plus de 60 ans, mais moins de 65 ans, l\u2019\u00e9quipage en service comprenne au moins un autre pilote qui soit titulaire d\u2019une licence en cours de validit\u00e9, qui poss\u00e8de les qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour toutes les phases de vol et qui soit \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans.\n[195] M. Elfassy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, sur les vols long-courriers, Air Canada renforcera l\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite en y ajoutant des membres sur les vols en question afin de se conformer \u00e0 la convention collective et au RAC. Le RAC pr\u00e9voit des r\u00e8gles normatives concernant la p\u00e9riode de service de vol. Toutefois, le R\u00e8glement autorise les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage \u00e0 prolonger leur journ\u00e9e de travail \u00e0 condition que d\u2019autres pilotes s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite.\n[196] La convention collective exige un \u00e9quipage de base plus un pilote suppl\u00e9mentaire et un pilote de r\u00e9serve ou deux pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires lorsque le vol est effectu\u00e9 en dehors de la zone nord-am\u00e9ricaine et d\u00e9passe quinze heures.\n[197] Un \u00c9tat contractant peut imposer une limite d\u2019\u00e2ge maximale moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la norme de l\u2019OACI pour les licences qu\u2019il d\u00e9livre \u00e0 ses pilotes, mais il ne peut pas emp\u00eacher un a\u00e9ronef provenant d\u2019un autre \u00c9tat d\u2019entrer dans son espace a\u00e9rien si le commandant de bord de cet a\u00e9ronef est titulaire d\u2019une licence d\u00e9livr\u00e9e ou valid\u00e9e par cet \u00c9tat et s\u2019il n\u2019a pas atteint la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge sup\u00e9rieure fix\u00e9e par l\u2019OACI.\n[198] Les articles 39 et 40 de la Convention sont \u00e9galement pertinents. L\u2019article 39 exige que les licences d\u00e9livr\u00e9es par un \u00c9tat contractant qui ne satisfont pas aux conditions impos\u00e9es par la norme de l\u2019OACI doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9es avec une \u00e9num\u00e9ration compl\u00e8te des points sur lesquels elles ne satisfont pas auxdites conditions.\n[199] L\u2019article 40 autorise les membres du personnel ayant des licences qui ne satisfont pas \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019OACI de participer \u00e0 la navigation internationale du moment qu\u2019ils ont obtenu la permission de l\u2019\u00c9tat sur le territoire duquel ils p\u00e9n\u00e8trent. Le Canada n\u2019impose pas de limite d\u2019\u00e2ge lors de la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une licence \u00e0 ses pilotes et autorise les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 ans ou plus, titulaires d\u2019une licence qui est d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par un \u00c9tat contractant de l\u2019OACI et qui est valide sur le plan m\u00e9dical, \u00e0 naviguer dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien.\n[200] M. Elfassy a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant du fait qu\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant desservi par Air Canada ait autoris\u00e9 les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans avant novembre 2006 ou de plus de 65 ans apr\u00e8s novembre 2006, \u00e0 naviguer dans son espace a\u00e9rien. Cette question devrait faire l\u2019objet de n\u00e9gociations entre les \u00c9tats contractants, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019une demande de la part d\u2019Air Canada.\n[201] En ce qui a trait aux cons\u00e9quences possibles pour une compagnie a\u00e9rienne qui transgresse la norme de l\u2019OACI, M. Elfassy a fait allusion au m\u00e9moire du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019aviation, en France. Dans ce document, le directeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de v\u00e9rifications effectu\u00e9es par des inspecteurs de l\u2019aire de trafic, ceux-ci ont constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait des capitaines \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 l\u2019interdiction de vol d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef qui n\u2019a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 partir qu\u2019avec un autre capitaine. \u00c0 l\u2019avenir, ils prendraient les mesures appropri\u00e9es pour faire face \u00e0 une telle situation. Il pourrait s\u2019agir du report d\u2019un vol jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la documentation ad\u00e9quate soit fournie ou de l\u2019interdiction de vol.\n[202] M. Elfassy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, outre les exigences de l\u2019OACI, Air Canada est \u00e9galement assujettie aux dispositions du 14 CFR, Part 129, Sp\u00e9cifications d\u2019exploitation \u00e9trang\u00e8res, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des activit\u00e9s que la compagnie exerce aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que, aux termes de Part 129, la Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) avait \u00e9mis, avant novembre 2006, des sp\u00e9cifications d\u2019exploitation qui pr\u00e9voyaient que le transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger (Air Canada) ne devait pas faire appel \u00e0 un commandant de bord ni \u00e0 une personne remplissant ces fonctions, si cette derni\u00e8re avait atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[203] Les sp\u00e9cifications d\u2019exploitation (OPSPEC) s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 Air Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es en d\u00e9cembre 2006 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les transporteurs a\u00e9riens \u00e9trangers se conforment aux exigences de l\u2019heure en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e2ge, pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1 de l\u2019OACI, version modifi\u00e9e, et le transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger ne doit pas recourir aux services d\u2019un pilote, ni \u00e0 ceux d\u2019une personne remplissant les fonctions de pilote d\u2019un avion civil inscrit au registre am\u00e9ricain dans la conduite d\u2019op\u00e9rations relevant de ces sp\u00e9cifications d\u2019exploitation, si cette personne a atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[204] M. Elfassy a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour Air Canada, cela signifie que les normes actuelles de l\u2019OACI s\u2019appliquent aux activit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle exerce aux \u00c9tats-Unis. La derni\u00e8re partie des OPSPEC est un exemple d\u2019un \u00c9tat imposant une exigence plus restrictive en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e2ge que la norme de l\u2019OACI. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, les \u00c9tats-Unis imposaient une limite d\u2019\u00e2ge maximum de 60 ans pour d\u00e9livrer des licences \u00e0 ses pilotes.\n[205] Toutefois, \u00e0 compter du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007, en vertu de la Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act, les \u00c9tats-Unis autorisent dor\u00e9navant les pilotes de l\u2019aviation commerciale \u00e0 piloter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans pour les destinations int\u00e9rieures. En ce qui concerne les vols internationaux, les \u00c9tats-Unis ont adopt\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[206] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Elfassy, lorsque celui-ci \u00e9tait le point de contact avec la FAA, si les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019OACI n\u2019\u00e9taient pas observ\u00e9es, l\u2019inspecteur principal de l\u2019exploitation de la FAA communiquait avec lui pour lui signaler que l\u2019un de leurs inspecteurs avait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 un avion d\u2019Air Canada et avait relev\u00e9 certains probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019Air Canada devait corriger. S\u2019il y avait des violations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es des OPSPEC, il pourrait y avoir des sanctions financi\u00e8res ou les OPSPEC pourraient \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9es de telle fa\u00e7on qu\u2019Air Canada ne pourrait plus assurer de services a\u00e9riens aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[207] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019application de la r\u00e9glementation de la FAA \u00e0 Air Canada, M. Elfassy a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre du 11 d\u00e9cembre 2006 de Rebecca B. McPherson, avocate en chef adjointe de la FAA, division de la r\u00e9glementation. Cette lettre r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 George Vilven, un copilote retrait\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada, qui demandait une interpr\u00e9tation juridique de la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e8gle des 60 ans \u00bb, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment si la r\u00e9glementation de la FAA permet \u00e0 un a\u00e9ronef d\u2019Air Canada, pilot\u00e9 par un commandant de bord \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de 60 ans, de survoler l\u2019espace am\u00e9ricain lors d\u2019un vol vers des destinations \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\n[208] Mme McPherson a r\u00e9pondu que les \u00c9tats-Unis appliquent la norme actuelle de l\u2019OACI aux transporteurs a\u00e9riens \u00e9trangers qui survolent l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien am\u00e9ricain. Avant le 23 novembre 2006, les \u00c9tats-Unis n\u2019autorisaient pas les vols effectu\u00e9s au-dessus de son territoire par un commandant de bord \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de 60 ans \u0153uvrant pour un transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger. Cette norme s\u2019appliquait m\u00eame s'il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019atterrissage aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis.\n[209] Selon Mme McPherson, la norme de l\u2019OACI emp\u00eachait aussi un transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger d\u2019utiliser un a\u00e9roport am\u00e9ricain comme un a\u00e9roport de d\u00e9gagement pr\u00e9vu, sauf dans le cas d\u2019une urgence n\u00e9cessitant un atterrissage aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Ce pays n\u2019applique pas la norme de l\u2019OACI \u00e0 un commandant adjoint. Aux termes de la norme de l\u2019OACI post\u00e9rieure au 23 novembre 2006, les \u00c9tats-Unis autorisent les transporteurs a\u00e9riens \u00e9trangers \u00e0 recourir aux services d\u2019un commandant de bord ou \u00e0 un commandant adjoint \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans ou plus si l\u2019un des d\u2019eux est \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans.\n(x) Arlo Speer [210] M. Speer occupe le poste de chef de la division des Licences des membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite et immatriculation des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 Transports Canada, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019aviation civile au Canada. Ses responsabilit\u00e9s ont trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de licences aux membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage de vol, \u00e0 l\u2019entretien et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019infrastructure r\u00e9glementaire relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de licences aux membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage de vol au Canada; il fournit des interpr\u00e9tations du RAC, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la partie IV qui traite de la d\u00e9livrance des licences et des modifications et r\u00e9visions p\u00e9riodiques de ces exigences, au besoin.\n[211] M. Speer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom des plaignants. Il a expliqu\u00e9, du point de vue de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 r\u00e9glementaire, le lien entre le Canada et la Convention de Chicago. En tant qu\u2019\u00c9tat contractant, le Canada partage avec les autres \u00c9tats l\u2019obligation de cr\u00e9er et de maintenir une structure de surveillance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9glementation de l\u2019aviation qui est compatible avec les exigences des normes de l\u2019OACI, pour autant que ces exigences cadrent avec les lois de chaque \u00c9tat. Le Canada est tenu d\u2019adh\u00e9rer aux normes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convenues au niveau international par l\u2019OACI dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces normes sont conformes aux exigences canadiennes.\n[212] Les normes de l\u2019OACI obligent les \u00c9tats contractants de l\u2019OACI \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une structure r\u00e9glementaire qui est compatible avec les normes de l\u2019OACI. Les pilotes et les autres exploitants au sein du syst\u00e8me de l\u2019aviation sont tenus d\u2019adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 la structure r\u00e9glementaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e soit par l\u2019\u00c9tat qui a fourni ses licences ou permis ou encore, par l\u2019\u00c9tat dans lequel sont effectu\u00e9es les op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes. Ainsi, le cadre r\u00e9glementaire est issu de l\u2019\u00c9tat et non de la norme elle-m\u00eame.\n[213] Les normes de l\u2019OACI ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9es au Canada \u00e0 la partie IV du RAC qui formule les exigences en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9livrance des licences aux membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage de vol. Comptant un tr\u00e8s petit nombre d\u2019exceptions, les normes de d\u00e9livrance des licences au Canada sont conformes aux normes de l\u2019OACI et, dans de nombreux cas, sont \u00e9galement conformes aux pratiques recommand\u00e9es par l\u2019OACI. Les \u00c9tats membres ne pas tenus d\u2019adopter ces pratiques. On s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les \u00c9tats membres appliquent les normes, mais les pratiques recommand\u00e9es sont des recommandations et les \u00c9tats membres ne sont pas oblig\u00e9s de les adopter.\n[214] M. Speer a expliqu\u00e9 que si un \u00c9tat membre ne veut pas int\u00e9grer une norme de l\u2019OACI dans ses r\u00e8glements, celui-ci doit signifier \u00e0 l\u2019OACI son opposition. Le fait qu\u2019un \u00c9tat ne respecte pas une norme donn\u00e9e de l\u2019OACI doit \u00eatre signal\u00e9 aux autres \u00c9tats contractants de l\u2019OACI. Les oppositions que le Canada a signifi\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019OACI figurent dans la section portant sur les licences de l\u2019Information a\u00e9ronautique publi\u00e9e par Transports Canada.\n[215] Le Canada a signifi\u00e9 une opposition \u00e0 l\u2019OACI \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 2.1.10 de l\u2019Annexe 1 de l\u2019OACI. Il a signifi\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne limite pas les privil\u00e8ges des pilotes ayant atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Deux raisons expliquent la signification de cette opposition : la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tant que le refus de d\u00e9livrer des licences ou d\u2019accorder des privil\u00e8ges strictement en fonction de l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme contrevenant \u00e0 la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s. La deuxi\u00e8me raison reposait sur des avis m\u00e9dicaux re\u00e7us par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux de Transports Canada qui soutenaient que, du point de vue de la d\u00e9livrance de licence, l\u2019\u00e2ge seul n\u2019est pas un motif valable pour pr\u00e9dire la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une brusque invalidation.\n[216] Chaque \u00c9tat contractant d\u00e9livre ses propres licences et proc\u00e8de \u00e0 ses propres \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales. La position du Canada est que si la licence est valable du point de vue m\u00e9dical, le Canada reconna\u00eetra une licence d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par un \u00c9tat contractant de l\u2019OACI quel que soit l\u2019\u00e2ge du titulaire. Le Canada impose aux pilotes \u00e9trangers les m\u00eames attentes et obligations que celles qui sont impos\u00e9es aux pilotes canadiens.\n[217] Le Canada reconna\u00eet les pilotes devant voler au Canada qui se sont vu d\u00e9livrer une licence par un autre \u00c9tat dans la mesure o\u00f9 ceux-ci observent le RAC et les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9livrance de leurs licences.\n[218] Le RAC s\u2019applique aux d\u00e9tenteurs de licence canadienne et aux a\u00e9ronefs canadiens, o\u00f9 qu\u2019ils soient. Pour les vols arrivant au Canada, c\u2019est la r\u00e9glementation canadienne qui s\u2019applique. La r\u00e9glementation du pays qui a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 la licence du pilote s\u2019appliquerait \u00e9galement.\n[219] Si un pilote \u00e9tranger qui pilote un a\u00e9ronef \u00e9tranger au Canada obtient des privil\u00e8ges sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux que procure la licence d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, le pilote serait \u00e9ventuellement coupable d\u2019avoir contrevenu au RAC et aussi coupable \u00e9ventuellement d\u2019une infraction \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation \u00e9trang\u00e8re.\n[220] Normalement, les autorit\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi et celles de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger collaborent de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que le pilote ne soit pas accus\u00e9 de violer deux lois distinctes, mais effectivement \u00e9quivalentes.\n[221] M. Speer a soulign\u00e9 que la convention de l\u2019OACI reconna\u00eet l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 de chaque \u00c9tat contractant et laisse \u00e0 ces derniers le pouvoir de fixer les exigences r\u00e9glementaires de leur choix. Les membres de l\u2019OACI s\u2019attendent \u00e0 ce que le Canada harmonise autant que possible ses exigences r\u00e9glementaires avec les normes de l\u2019OACI.\n[222] Par exemple, il existe des types de licence d\u00e9livr\u00e9s aux pilotes pour lesquels le Canada exige davantage d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, de connaissances ou de comp\u00e9tences que celles qui sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es par l\u2019OACI, ce qui fait en sorte que les exigences canadiennes sont plus restrictives que celles de l\u2019OACI. Il y a d\u2019autres exemples, tels que la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge maximum des pilotes examin\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, o\u00f9 le Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre moins restrictif et de ne pas imposer la norme de l\u2019OACI.\n[223] M. Speer a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 39b) de la Convention. Il a affirm\u00e9 que le Canada est tenu, aux termes de ce paragraphe, de faire une annotation sur les documents\/licences qu\u2019il d\u00e9livre lorsque le titulaire ne se conforme pas aux normes internationales. Par exemple, TC d\u00e9livre une licence avec qualification de type appropri\u00e9 pour les pilotes de r\u00e9serve sur les vols long-courriers qui ne se sont pas qualifi\u00e9s pour les \u00e9tapes de d\u00e9collage ou de d\u00e9part et pour celles d\u2019approche ou d\u2019atterrissage. Ils doivent acqu\u00e9rir une qualification pour la partie du vol long-courrier effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019altitude de croisi\u00e8re.\n[224] M. Speer a \u00e9t\u00e9 questionn\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019un sc\u00e9nario o\u00f9 un a\u00e9ronef assujetti aux dispositions du 14 CFR, Part 121, dont l\u2019\u00e9quivalent est la partie VII du RAC, quitte Seattle et survole l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien \u00e0 destination d\u2019Anchorage. Il s\u2019est fait demander ce que pense Transports Canada de ce vol, qui est \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien, relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de licences aux membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage.\n[225] Il a r\u00e9pondu que la meilleure r\u00e9ponse qu\u2019il puisse donner est de se reporter \u00e0 l\u2019opposition signifi\u00e9e par le Canada, \u00e0 savoir que le Canada n\u2019a aucune objection au fait que des pilotes de plus de 60 ans qui d\u00e9tiennent une licence, valide sur le plan m\u00e9dical ou autrement et d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par un \u00c9tat contractant de l\u2019OACI, conduisent un a\u00e9ronef \u00e9tranger au Canada. Donc, s\u2019il est suppos\u00e9 que le vol est conforme \u00e0 la loi am\u00e9ricaine et les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s le confirment, alors le Canada n\u2019aurait aucune objection \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un a\u00e9ronef assujetti aux dispositions du CFR, Part 121, ou autrement survole l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien.\n(xi) Harlan Clark [226] En plus de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, M. Clark a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la question relative \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a). Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada compte actuellement environ 3 000 pilotes et que ce nombre a peu vari\u00e9 au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Air Canada demande aux nouvelles recrues 2 500 \u00e0 3 000 heures de vol et celles-ci doivent d\u00e9tenir une licence de pilote de ligne (ATPL).\n[227] Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents habituels de ceux qui sont embauch\u00e9s sont les petites compagnies a\u00e9riennes ou le domaine militaire. En raison du nombre d\u2019heures sur des a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 voilure fixe demand\u00e9 par Air Canada, les candidats doivent poss\u00e9der une exp\u00e9rience de vol consid\u00e9rable avant d\u2019entrer \u00e0 Air Canada.\n[228] Les nouveaux pilotes embauch\u00e9s par Air Canada font partie au d\u00e9part du groupe de poste qui comprend le personnel suivant : copilote des EMJ170\/190, pilote de rel\u00e8ve du B767, pilote de rel\u00e8ve du B787, pilote de rel\u00e8ve du A340 et pilote de rel\u00e8ve du B777.\n[229] La flotte d\u2019Air Canada est compos\u00e9e des a\u00e9ronefs B777, A330 et B767, tous de gros\u2011porteurs, des A321\/A320\/A319 et des EMJ190\/175. Les emplois de pilote sont divis\u00e9s en 16 postes non interchangeables, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des emplois de capitaine, de copilote et de pilote de rel\u00e8ve sur un gros-porteur, et de capitaine et de copilote sur un autre a\u00e9ronef. Chaque pilote d\u2019Air Canada re\u00e7oit une formation et acquiert la qualification valide pour un type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, et ne peut piloter que ce type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef.\n[230] Les pilotes progressent dans leurs carri\u00e8res \u00e0 Air Canada selon leur anciennet\u00e9. Dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse du comit\u00e9 directeur de composition des \u00e9quipages (CDCE) qui a eu lieu au moins deux fois par ann\u00e9e (et qui peut avoir lieu jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre fois par ann\u00e9e), les pilotes soumettent leur demande indiquant leur pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence (DIP) pour le poste, un processus qui d\u00e9termine le statut du pilote, l\u2019appareil que celui-ci utilise et la base \u00e0 laquelle il est affect\u00e9.\n[231] Outre la DIP, les pilotes doivent soumettre une demande mensuelle. En effet, \u00e0 chaque mois, les pilotes ont \u00e0 choisir leur horaire. Selon leur anciennet\u00e9, ils se verront attribuer un cr\u00e9neau horaire, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, les vols qu\u2019ils effectueront pendant le mois en question. Ils peuvent utiliser leur anciennet\u00e9 pour choisir la qualit\u00e9 de leur horaire, comme les cong\u00e9s et la p\u00e9riode de vacances.\n[232] Les pilotes qui veulent changer de type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef, de statut ou de base ont la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire au moyen de la DIP. S\u2019ils ont suffisamment d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour occuper le poste vis\u00e9, celui-ci leur sera attribu\u00e9 dans le cadre du processus de postulation du CDCE; les pilotes suivront ult\u00e9rieurement une formation pour le poste en question. Toutefois, m\u00eame s\u2019ils acqui\u00e8rent la qualification, lorsque vient le moment de faire part de leur choix concernant l\u2019horaire de travail mensuel, ils peuvent ne pas avoir suffisamment d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour obtenir un cr\u00e9neau, dans ce cas, ils seront inscrits sur la liste de r\u00e9serve.\n[233] Les pilotes de r\u00e9serve sont sur appel pour faire du remplacement au besoin, par exemple lorsque le pilote pr\u00e9vu t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour signaler qu\u2019il est malade ou pour donner d\u2019autres raisons qui l\u2019emp\u00eachent d\u2019effectuer le vol. Ils ont un horaire mensuel qui indique les journ\u00e9es o\u00f9 ils sont sur appel et celles o\u00f9 ils piloteraient l\u2019a\u00e9ronef pour lequel ils ont acquis la qualification.\n[234] Il est important de ne pas confondre pilotes de r\u00e9serve avec pilotes de rel\u00e8ve. Le pilote de rel\u00e8ve (PR) occupe un poste, alors qu\u2019un pilote de r\u00e9serve se voit assigner les t\u00e2ches d\u00e9crites sur l\u2019horaire mensuel. Pour n\u2019importe quel type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef donn\u00e9 et n\u2019importe quel mois donn\u00e9, il y a donc des pilotes de rel\u00e8ve r\u00e9guliers et des pilotes de r\u00e9serve sur appel.\n[235] Un pilote de rel\u00e8ve est un pilote qui est moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9; il est le troisi\u00e8me pilote au sein d\u2019un \u00e9quipage compos\u00e9 de trois pilotes sur un gros-porteur. Pour les vols internationaux sur une certaine p\u00e9riode de service de vol, un troisi\u00e8me pilote est n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019assurer que le capitaine et le copilote b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de la p\u00e9riode de repos r\u00e9glementaire, mais un pilote de rel\u00e8ve peut \u00eatre dans le poste de pilotage uniquement pour la partie du vol effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019altitude de croisi\u00e8re. Le pilote de rel\u00e8ve n\u2019a pas acquis la qualification requise pour toutes les \u00e9tapes d\u2019un vol, telles que le d\u00e9collage et l\u2019atterrissage ou le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019a\u00e9ronef vole \u00e0 10 000 pieds au-dessus du niveau du sol.\n[236] Si un pilote postule avec succ\u00e8s un nouveau poste dans le cadre du processus de postulation du CDCE, il recevra une formation de transition sur le type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef pour lequel il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature et auquel il peut ne pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 pour une autre ann\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s une analyse du CDCE, les pilotes conserveront donc leur poste actuel et le poste attribu\u00e9 par le CDCE jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils suivent une nouvelle formation.\n[237] Outre la formation initiale que re\u00e7oit un pilote qui entre au service d\u2019Air Canada et la formation de transition, il y a une formation d\u2019avancement pour devenir capitaine et une formation annuelle p\u00e9riodique. La formation initiale comprend une formation au sol\/formation de familiarisation au pilotage, puis le pilote re\u00e7oit une formation en simulateur suivie d\u2019une v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence en route. Air Canada emploie des pilotes qui sont qualifi\u00e9s par Transports Canada pour assumer les fonctions de pilotes inspecteurs. Ces derniers accompagnent les pilotes en formation sur un vol de v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence. Une fois que le pilote a termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le vol de v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence, il acquiert une qualification sur ce type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef.\n[238] La formation d\u2019une nouvelle recrue prend environ deux mois. La formation initiale est la plus longue, parce que la formation au sol dure plus longtemps. La formation de transition comprend une formation au sol, une formation en simulateur et un vol de v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence ; elle peut prendre de huit \u00e0 dix semaines.\n[239] La formation d\u2019avancement pour devenir capitaine comprend une formation au sol pour le leadership et le contr\u00f4le op\u00e9rationnel. La formation p\u00e9riodique est donn\u00e9e lorsque les pilotes ayant acquis une qualification pour un type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef assistent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 des s\u00e9ances de formation en simulateur pour conserver leur qualification \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet a\u00e9ronef. Il s\u2019agit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de s\u00e9ances d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Le changement de statut, m\u00eame pour un type identique d\u2019appareil, exige une formation, un certain temps d\u2019utilisation de simulateur et un vol de v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence, mais il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une formation de transition compl\u00e8te.\n[240] M. Clark a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il en co\u00fbterait environ 30 000 $ \u00e0 40 000 $ pour former un pilote lorsqu\u2019il est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre poste. Une grande partie des co\u00fbts serait attribuable au salaire des pilotes non productifs. Il y aurait aussi le co\u00fbt relatif \u00e0 la dotation par un rempla\u00e7ant lorsque le pilote n\u2019est pas en fonction et qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de le remplacer par d\u2019autres pilotes qui travailleront pendant que le pilote est en formation et qu\u2019il est non productif. Il y a \u00e9galement le co\u00fbt des salaires des instructeurs et celui du fonctionnement du simulateur.\n[241] Outre la formule de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, la convention collective pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement un montant minimal garanti (MMG) qui est li\u00e9 au nombre maximal d\u2019heures mensuelles d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (NMHMD). Pour un pilote de r\u00e9serve dont le NMHMD est de 70 heures, le MMG est de 65 heures. Il s\u2019agit du nombre minimum d\u2019heures pour lequel le pilote de r\u00e9serve est assur\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019effectue pas ces heures de vol. Pour celui qui obtient un cr\u00e9neau horaire, le MMG est de 60 heures et le NMHMD est de 70 heures. La diff\u00e9rence \u00e9tant qu\u2019un pilote de r\u00e9serve est sur appel et qu\u2019il peut ou non \u00eatre tenu d\u2019effectuer ces heures de vol pendant le mois.\n[242] L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 entre en jeu comme facteur d\u00e9terminant le montant que gagne un pilote, parce que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 d\u00e9termine l\u2019horaire de travail mensuel et le nombre d\u2019heures de vol effectu\u00e9es pendant le mois. \u00c0 mesure que le pilote cumule de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, il peut demander \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des types d\u2019appareil exigeant une qualification sup\u00e9rieure et s\u2019il a l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, il obtiendra une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour piloter un appareil de plus grande taille.\n[243] Air Canada emploie des pilotes qui occupent des postes permanents de gestion et qui assument des fonctions de gestion, tout en restant ou en \u00e9tant inscrits sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Ils ne demandent pas une analyse du CDCE ou des horaires de travail mensuels. Ils ont acquis une qualification pour certains a\u00e9ronefs et doivent piloter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement afin de maintenir leur comp\u00e9tence. Les pilotes occupant des postes permanents de gestion peuvent revenir au service a\u00e9rien, ce qui veut dire qu\u2019ils renoncent \u00e0 leurs fonctions de gestion et redeviennent des pilotes de ligne.\n(xii) Edward Tarapasky [244] M. Tararpasky exerce les fonctions de gestionnaire, Horaires des \u00e9quipages de vol, en charge de l\u2019automatisation et des processus pour les op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes. Il occupe ce poste depuis quatre ans et travaille chez Air Canada depuis 25 ans.\n[245] Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente audience, M. Tarapasky a produit un document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab exp\u00e9riences sp\u00e9ciales de satisfaction des demandes indiquant les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00bb.\n[246] Il ressort de ces exp\u00e9riences que si la retraite obligatoire n\u2019existait plus \u00e0 Air Canada, \u00e0 un certain point le syst\u00e8me de postulation fond\u00e9 sur les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences (SPFP) ne serait pas en mesure de produire un cr\u00e9neau horaire ou des horaires de vol mensuels pour ses pilotes et ceux-ci ne pourraient effectuer les heures de vol mensuelles.\n[247] Le SPFP est un programme informatique qui analyse les donn\u00e9es et produit des horaires fond\u00e9s sur des r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9\u00e9tablies et les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des pilotes ainsi que sur un cr\u00e9neau horaire. Un cr\u00e9neau horaire est l\u2019horaire de vol mensuel d\u2019un pilote. Pour cr\u00e9er un cr\u00e9neau, l\u2019ordinateur tient compte des vols du mois en cours, des absences planifi\u00e9es telles que la formation et les vacances, des vols de v\u00e9rification de comp\u00e9tence, des heures de vol du mois suivant ainsi que des contraintes r\u00e9glementaires et contractuelles.\n[248] Le cr\u00e9neau horaire mensuel se subdivise en jumelage. Un jumelage correspond \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de vols et peut consister en un ou plusieurs vols de mise en place. Un vol de mise en place correspond au d\u00e9but, au milieu ou \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une affectation \u00e0 un jumelage de vol lorsqu\u2019un pilote n\u2019est pas dans le poste de pilotage et qu\u2019il se dirige vers une destination en vue d\u2019effectuer un autre vol.\n[249] Le service de marketing produit un plan de marketing qui \u00e9tablit l\u2019horaire des vols pour les destinations du mois suivant et qui pr\u00e9cise le type d\u2019a\u00e9ronef ainsi que la fr\u00e9quence des vols. Le plan est envoy\u00e9 par transfert \u00e9lectronique aux analystes de l\u2019\u00e9quipage qui entrent cette information dans le SPFP.\n[250] Outre ces donn\u00e9es, deux groupes de dossiers sont introduits dans le SPFP, l\u2019information sur le jour du vol \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 de sept dossiers et de cinq dossiers relatifs au jumelage, soit un pour chaque appareil et un pour chaque pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. C\u2019est ce que les pilotes utilisent pour indiquer le type de vol qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent ou souhaitent \u00e9viter. Ces donn\u00e9es ainsi que les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences servent \u00e0 cr\u00e9er les cr\u00e9neaux et le jumelage du mois suivant.\n[251] Le SPFP contient cinq cat\u00e9gories de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et 74 offres individuelles, et utilise un syst\u00e8me d\u2019offres pond\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce syst\u00e8me attribue des points (0-1 000) qui indiquent dans quelle mesure une offre particuli\u00e8re est appropri\u00e9e ou inappropri\u00e9e pour le pilote. Le SPFP proc\u00e8de par ordre d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour calculer le meilleur pointage possible pour chaque pilote. Plus le pilote est exp\u00e9riment\u00e9, plus le pointage est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Un pointage \u00e9lev\u00e9 indique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que le pilote se classant assez haut sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 se voit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accorder ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[252] M. Tarapasky a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un certain nombre de contraintes sont introduites dans le SPFP pour cr\u00e9er un cr\u00e9neau. Certaines d\u00e9coulent de la convention collective, comme le DSM et la r\u00e8gle du temps flexible par mois. D\u2019autres contraintes d\u00e9coulent du RAC, par exemple, la r\u00e8gle qui limite le temps de vol \u00e0 40 heures en sept jours cons\u00e9cutifs et \u00e0 120 heures en 30 jours cons\u00e9cutifs, et qui pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9riode de repos minimale de trois jours de cong\u00e9 cons\u00e9cutifs par p\u00e9riode de 17 \u00e0 24 jours. Le SPFP tiendra compte de ces contraintes lors de la cr\u00e9ation des cr\u00e9neaux du mois suivant.\n[253] Aux fins de ces exp\u00e9riences, M. Tarapasky a ajout\u00e9 une contrainte suppl\u00e9mentaire, soit la \u00ab r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI \u00bb pour d\u00e9terminer de quelle fa\u00e7on le SPFP pourrait assigner un jumelage pour cr\u00e9er des cr\u00e9neaux, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, pour trouver une \u00ab solution \u00bb. Les r\u00e8gles de base pour les exp\u00e9riences \u00e9taient les suivantes : un capitaine (CA) et un copilote par vol et aucun des deux pilotes n\u2019\u00e9tait susceptible de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions, c.-\u00e0-d., que les deux pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 \u00e9taient sur le m\u00eame vol.\n[254] La premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience d\u2019accommodement visait 10 CA et 10 copilotes pour 10 vols; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que 40 % des capitaines et 40 % des copilotes \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions. Le SPFP g\u00e8re toujours en premier les solutions relatives aux CA et, en second, celles relatives aux copilotes. Dans cet exemple, il n\u2019y a aucun facteur limitatif pour le capitaine et le CA le plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 aurait le choix parmi les dix vols. Le deuxi\u00e8me CA le plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 aurait le choix parmi les neuf vols, et ce, jusqu\u2019au dixi\u00e8me CA qui obtiendrait le vol restant, ce qui fait au total 55 choix.\n[255] Cependant, dans le cas des copilotes, du fait que 40 % des CA \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions, le copilote le plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 ne pouvait piloter qu\u2019avec le capitaine arrivant en cinqui\u00e8me position jusqu\u2019\u00e0 celui occupant la dixi\u00e8me, ce qui veut dire que le copilote n\u2019a que six choix de vol possibles, et non dix, comme cela aurait normalement d\u00fb \u00eatre le cas.\n[256] Les choix du copilote s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 39 au lieu de 55 en l\u2019absence de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI. Air Canada s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur cette exp\u00e9rience d\u2019accommodement pour d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 quel point la satisfaction des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage est touch\u00e9e lorsque des restrictions suppl\u00e9mentaires, telles que la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI, sont apport\u00e9es.\n[257] Dans l\u2019exp\u00e9rience suivante, M. Tarapasky a suppos\u00e9 que sept CA sur dix, soit 70 %, et quatre copilotes sur dix, soit 40 %, sont susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions. Il a conclu qu\u2019aucune solution ne peut \u00eatre apport\u00e9e et que, en vue d\u2019effectuer les dix vols, Air Canada devrait ajouter de nouveaux pilotes ou r\u00e9duire le nombre de vols.\n[258] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le syst\u00e8me g\u00e8re d\u2019abord les solutions relatives aux CA. Il n\u2019y a donc aucun effet sur les solutions et les choix en ce qui concerne les capitaines. Mais lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit des solutions relatives aux copilotes, le copilote le plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 n\u2019aura que trois choix de vol, parce que deux pilotes susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions ne peuvent piloter ensemble.\n[259] Le copilote num\u00e9ro 2 a deux choix, le copilote num\u00e9ro 3 n\u2019a qu\u2019un seul choix possible. Dans le cas du copilote num\u00e9ro 4, la solution ne fonctionne pas parce que celle-ci doit r\u00e9soudre les dix vols; il n\u2019existe aucune solution parce que le copilote 4 ne peut \u00eatre assign\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun jumelage sans que ne soit transgress\u00e9e la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[260] Les exp\u00e9riences suivantes ont soulev\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir quel nombre de pilotes susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions Air Canada peut-elle accommoder? Ces exp\u00e9riences \u00e9taient ax\u00e9es sur les gros-porteurs B-777, B-767 et A-330 des bases de Toronto, de Vancouver et de Montr\u00e9al. Ces exp\u00e9riences visaient \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le nombre de pilotes de plus de 60 ans qu\u2019Air Canada pourrait accommoder dans un mois donn\u00e9, tout en respectant les obligations impos\u00e9es par l\u2019OACI si la retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait abolie.\n[261] Ces exp\u00e9riences ne reposent pas sur un nombre particulier de pilotes hypoth\u00e9tiquement employ\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 60 ans. Elles reposent sur les op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes r\u00e9elles d\u2019Air Canada et les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences r\u00e9elles de ses pilotes pour le mois de juin 2009 avec la contrainte suppl\u00e9mentaire de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[262] La premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience visait, en juin 2009, les copilotes de 777 de la base de Toronto. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, 104 CA et 136 copilotes \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s au B777. Cette exp\u00e9rience a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats suivants. Toute combinaison de 10 % \u00e0 40 % de CA et de 10 % \u00e0 50 % de copilotes donnerait une solution, \u00e0 savoir un cr\u00e9neau horaire mensuel et des jumelages.\n[263] Ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019il a atteint le niveau de 50 % de CA (52) et de 50 % de copilotes (68), tous \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans, que le SPFP n\u2019est pas parvenu \u00e0 trouver une solution. Cela signifie hypoth\u00e9tiquement qu\u2019Air Canada ne pourrait se servir de cet appareil de la base de Toronto.\n[264] L\u2019exp\u00e9rience suivante a trait \u00e0 une analyse du pointage obtenu des copilotes de B777 de la base de Toronto en juin 2009. Il s\u2019agissait ici d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019incidence sur la solution de l\u2019ajout d\u2019une autre contrainte dans le SPFP, soit la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI susceptible de restreindre les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans. Ce que M. Tarapasky a fait ici, c\u2019est de comparer la solution r\u00e9elle originale relative au cr\u00e9neau horaire, en juin 2009, visant un nombre al\u00e9atoire de copilotes de B777 de la base de Toronto \u00e0 la solution qui a r\u00e9solu aussit\u00f4t la question, soit avant qu\u2019aucune solution possible ne se pr\u00e9sente, et il a analys\u00e9 les \u00e9carts de points obtenus pour les deux solutions.\n[265] Le SPFP attribue des points (0-1 000) qui indiquent dans quelle mesure une offre particuli\u00e8re est appropri\u00e9e ou inappropri\u00e9e pour le pilote. Le SPFP proc\u00e8de par ordre d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour calculer le meilleur pointage possible pour chaque pilote. Le pointage \u00e9lev\u00e9 indique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que le pilote se classant assez haut sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 se voit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accorder ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[266] Les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019analyse du pointage ont donn\u00e9 ceci : sur le nombre total de copilotes de la base de Toronto en juin 2009, la restriction a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur 57 copilotes, mais pour 47 copilotes, il n\u2019y a eu aucun changement et, pour 43 copilotes, l\u2019incidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 positive. Une incidence n\u00e9gative signifie que le pilote a obtenu un pointage inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qu\u2019il avait obtenu au d\u00e9part en juin 2009 et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il aurait eu s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de pilotes susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions dans le SPFP.\n[267] Aucun changement signifie que les pilotes ont obtenu un pointage \u00e9gal \u00e0 ce qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9. Une am\u00e9lioration signifie que leur pointage s\u2019est accru. Cela pourrait se produire lorsque des copilotes exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s n\u2019obtiennent pas ce qu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9, que le pilotage est rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres parties de la solution de telle sorte que le pointage des pilotes moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s augmenterait et que ces derniers obtiendraient une meilleure offre parce que le SPFP doit trouver un copilote de moins de 60 ans.\n[268] Dans ce sc\u00e9nario, il n\u2019y aurait aucune incidence sur les CA, parce que le SPFP g\u00e8re les solutions s\u00e9quentiellement sans restriction pour les CA. Ce sont seulement les copilotes qui sont touch\u00e9s. Chaque fois qu\u2019une solution s\u2019appliquant aux copilotes est examin\u00e9e, le SPFP tient compte des solutions relatives aux capitaines pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI soit respect\u00e9e avant que le copilote se voit accorder ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[269] Cependant, M. Tarapasky a affirm\u00e9 que les pilotes ignoreraient si l\u2019incidence sur eux \u00e9tait positive ou n\u00e9gative. Ils verraient simplement leur pointage final, mais ne seraient pas au courant de ce qu\u2019ils pourraient avoir obtenu. Cet exercice vise simplement \u00e0 montrer les diff\u00e9rences qui r\u00e9sulteraient entre le cr\u00e9neau horaire initial par rapport au cr\u00e9neau horaire faisant l\u2019objet de restrictions et dans quelle mesure la satisfaction des pilotes pourrait \u00eatre touch\u00e9e.\n[270] M. Tarapasky a eu recours \u00e0 la m\u00eame m\u00e9thodologie pour le reste des exp\u00e9riences. Pour les copilotes de B777 de la base de Vancouver, en juin 2009, le nombre r\u00e9el de pilotes s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 46 CA et \u00e0 73 copilotes. Dans cette exp\u00e9rience, aucune solution n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e au niveau o\u00f9 50 % des CA \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions et o\u00f9 30 % des copilotes \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions. Toute combinaison des pourcentages sous ces taux produirait une solution. L\u2019analyse du pointage a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats suivants : la restriction a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative dans 23 cas; il n\u2019y a eu aucune incidence dans 17 cas et, dans 23 cas, l\u2019incidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 positive.\n[271] Pour les copilotes de A330 de la base de Vancouver, en juin 2009, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience a port\u00e9 au total sur 30 CA et sur 35 copilotes. Le SPFP a produit une solution pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages de CA et de copilotes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 30 % de CA et de 50 % de copilotes. L\u2019analyse du pointage a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats suivants : la restriction a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative dans 8 cas; il n\u2019y a eu aucune incidence dans 14 cas et, dans 4 cas, l\u2019incidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 positive.\n[272] Pour les copilotes de 767 de la base de Toronto, en juin 2009, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience a port\u00e9 au total sur 136 CA et sur 119 copilotes. Le SPFP a produit une solution pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages de CA et de copilotes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 40 % de CA et de 50 % de copilotes. L\u2019analyse du pointage a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats suivants : la restriction a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative pour 47 copilotes; il n\u2019y a eu aucune incidence pour 16 copilotes et l\u2019incidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 positive pour 51 copilotes.\n[273] Pour les copilotes de A330 de la base de Toronto, en juin 2009, le SPFP a produit une solution pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages de CA et de copilotes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 50 % de CA et de 50 % de copilotes. Pour les copilotes de B777 de la base de Montr\u00e9al, en juin 2009, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience a port\u00e9 au total sur 13 CA et sur 12 copilotes et le SPFP a produit une solution pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages de CA et de copilotes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 50 % de CA et de 40 % de copilotes.\n[274] Pour les copilotes de B767 de la base de Vancouver, en juin 2009, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience a port\u00e9 au total sur 89 CA et sur 78 copilotes et le SPFP a produit une solution pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 60 % de CA et de 50 % de copilotes. Pour les copilotes de B767 de la base de Montr\u00e9al, en juin 2009, l\u2019observation est la m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit atteinte la combinaison de 50 % de CA et de 50 % de copilotes.\n[275] M. Tarapasky s\u2019est fait demander si, dans l\u2019une quelconque de ces exp\u00e9riences, il avait tenu compte des pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires et des pilotes de rel\u00e8ve. Il a r\u00e9pondu que les pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires font partie de la solution s\u2019appliquant aux copilotes, parce qu\u2019ils sont des copilotes enti\u00e8rement qualifi\u00e9s.\n(xiii) Professeur Johnathan Kesselman [276] Le professeur Kesselman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les plaignants. Il a obtenu son doctorat en 1972 de la facult\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9conomie du Massachusetts of Technology. Il est l\u2019auteur de nombreuses publications en \u00e9conomie et en \u00e9conomie du travail. Il a enseign\u00e9 ces deux disciplines pendant plus de 30 ans et il enseigne actuellement aux \u00e9tudiants du programme de ma\u00eetrise en politique publique \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9 Simon Fraser. Il d\u00e9tient \u00e9galement une chaire de recherche du Canada en finances publiques. Il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour donner un avis d\u2019expert en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[277] Le professeur Kesselman a d\u2019abord t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur la question de savoir pendant combien d\u2019ann\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires travailleraient les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada si la retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait abolie. Compte tenu des constatations empiriques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales concernant les effets sur l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite dans les professions ayant mis fin \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire, des \u00e9tudes statistiques ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe un l\u00e9ger effet positif et d\u2019autres \u00e9tudes concluent que l\u2019effet n\u2019\u00e9tait pas statistiquement consid\u00e9rable.\n[278] Ce sont traditionnellement des professions o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge obligatoire. En fait, peu de personnes dans la plupart des professions veulent continuer de travailler apr\u00e8s 65 ans et l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite de la population active canadienne est bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 65 ans : ce serait davantage vers 61 ou 62 ans.\n[279] Dans le cas des pilotes, il n\u2019existe aucune \u00e9tude empirique portant sur le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires pendant lesquelles travailleraient ceux-ci si la contrainte de l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans est lev\u00e9e. En faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux \u00e9tudes r\u00e9alis\u00e9es pour les professions ayant aboli la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 65 ans, le professeur Kesselman ne visait qu\u2019\u00e0 transmettre des renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux; il ne s\u2019en sert pas pour pr\u00e9voir ce qui arrivera aux pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[280] Cependant, en raison du mode de vie, de la satisfaction que procure le travail de pilote et du salaire \u00e9lev\u00e9, il s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 que cela incite davantage les pilotes \u00e0 continuer de travailler que ce n\u2019est le cas pour la population en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a presque aucun effet sur les ann\u00e9es d\u2019activit\u00e9 en moyenne.\n[281] Il a affirm\u00e9 que, selon les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tir\u00e9s de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de quatre ans et demi, soit de 2005 jusque vers le milieu de 2009, 21 % des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada avaient pris leur retraite avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Pendant certaines de ces ann\u00e9es, Air Canada avait offert des primes de retraite anticip\u00e9e pour inciter le personnel \u00e0 prendre une retraite anticip\u00e9e sans subir une r\u00e9duction de la pension.\n[282] Selon la preuve sur laquelle il s\u2019est fond\u00e9, sur l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode, soit de 2005 \u00e0 2009, 21 % des pilotes, soit 107 sur 515, avaient pris une retraite anticip\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Pour 2005 et 2009, il \u00e9tait au courant qu\u2019il y avait eu une offre de primes de retraite anticip\u00e9e, mais il n\u2019avait pas les d\u00e9tails au sujet de ces mesures d\u2019encouragement.\n[283] Cependant, il a soulign\u00e9 que, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, il y a eu \u00e9galement des retraites anticip\u00e9es sans aucune mesure d\u2019encouragement. Il a donc supprim\u00e9 les p\u00e9riodes pendant lesquelles des mesures d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es et a mis l\u2019accent sur les ann\u00e9es 2006, 2007 et 2008 afin de soustraire les effets possibles des mesures d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e et d\u2019examiner le comportement qui a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de l\u2019absence de telles mesures. Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2006, 2007 et 2008, 40 pilotes d\u2019Air Canada sur 328 au total, soit plus de 12 %, ont pris une retraite anticip\u00e9e.\n[284] Au chapitre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pouvant inciter les pilotes \u00e0 continuer de travailler apr\u00e8s 60 ans, il a convenu que, dans le cas d\u2019une personne qui n\u2019a pas maximis\u00e9 ses ann\u00e9es de service ou sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au regard du r\u00e9gime de retraite, cette situation pourrait l\u2019inciter \u00e0 continuer de travailler. Comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, cela doit \u00eatre compar\u00e9 aux autres facteurs qu\u2019il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crits. Il a \u00e9galement convenu que, m\u00eame si quelqu\u2019un a atteint le nombre maximal d\u2019ann\u00e9es, s\u2019il a la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019augmenter ses revenus aux fins du calcul de ses cinq meilleures ann\u00e9es, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui incite la personne \u00e0 continuer de travailler.\n[285] Au-del\u00e0 de cela, il n\u2019est pas profitable de perdre les ann\u00e9es de prestations de retraite qui pourraient repr\u00e9senter 60 % de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 temps plein pour travailler en vue de gagner 40 % du revenu habituel. En outre, cela ne semble pas tellement attirant par rapport aux loisirs, au fait de travailler ailleurs ou \u00e0 autre chose que la personne pourrait choisir.\n[286] Il a admis que son point de vue serait quelque peu temp\u00e9r\u00e9 par le fait que l\u2019horaire de travail mensuel n\u2019exige d\u2019un pilote type exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 que huit jours de travail par mois avec cong\u00e9 tous les week-ends. En outre, un pilote ayant 25 ans d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 touche de g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses allocations de vacances et quatre jours de cong\u00e9 tenant lieu de jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s. Ce genre d\u2019avantages pourrait inciter un pilote \u00e0 continuer de travailler.\n[287] Le professeur Kesselman a estim\u00e9 que les promotions seraient retard\u00e9es d\u2019environ neuf mois pour les jeunes pilotes. Ces pilotes sacrifieraient donc neuf mois pour obtenir une promotion, le niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 normal, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des a\u00e9ronefs d\u2019un certain type et d\u2019une certaine taille et un revenu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Toutefois, ils pourraient compenser cette perte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans en travaillant neuf mois de plus. Ils peuvent aussi travailler un an, deux ans, trois ans ou cinq ans de plus. C\u2019est une solution tr\u00e8s valable.\n[288] Le professeur Kesselman a conclu finalement qu\u2019il n\u2019a pu trouver aucune \u00e9tude empirique qui indiquerait le nombre de pilotes qui d\u00e9cideraient de continuer de travailler apr\u00e8s 60 ans chez Air Canada, ou m\u00eame un ordre de grandeur de ce nombre, ainsi que le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles ils travailleront r\u00e9ellement.\n[289] Selon lui, toute preuve apport\u00e9e par quiconque dans cette instance au sujet du nombre probable de pilotes qui d\u00e9cident effectivement de continuer de travailler au-del\u00e0 de 60 ans ne serait qu\u2019une estimation au jug\u00e9 et que, au mieux, elle reposerait sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels. Il ne soutient pas que ses donn\u00e9es sont pr\u00e9cises et ne croit pas qu\u2019une autre personne pr\u00e9sente peut apporter davantage de pr\u00e9cisions ou de certitude.\n[290] Le professeur Kesselman a ensuite examin\u00e9 plus particuli\u00e8rement la question de l\u2019incidence probable de l\u2019\u00e9limination de la retraite obligatoire pour les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 ans sur la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada d\u2019affecter l\u2019\u00e9quipage de vol tout en respectant les appels d\u2019offres fond\u00e9s sur les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a comment\u00e9 la preuve relative aux exp\u00e9riences d\u2019accommodement r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par M. Tarapasky.\n[291] Le professeur Kesselman a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la preuve concernant les invitations aux d\u00eeners de retraite organis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intention des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et parrain\u00e9s par l\u2019APAC et Air Canada, qui ont eu lieu \u00e0 Toronto, \u00e0 Winnipeg et \u00e0 Vancouver en 2008 et en 2009. Ces invitations donnent la liste des noms et le statut des personnes ayant pris leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[292] Il a calcul\u00e9 que moins de 10 % de ceux qui sont oblig\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans \u00e9taient des copilotes. Cela indique que la plupart des pilotes atteignent le grade de capitaine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire. \u00c0 son avis, pr\u00e9sumer, comme l\u2019a fait M. Tarapasky, que 30, 40 ou 50 % des copilotes auraient plus de 60 ans n\u2019est pas r\u00e9aliste.\n[293] M\u00eame en l\u2019absence de cette preuve, le professeur Kesselman a contest\u00e9 les hypoth\u00e8ses de M. Tarapasky selon lesquelles les copilotes, \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle, resteront ind\u00e9finiment des copilotes et ne seront pas promus au grade de capitaine. Les copilotes, qu\u2019ils aient 59, 55 ou 45 ans, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, deviendront capitaines avant de prendre leur retraite.\n[294] S\u2019il y a un assouplissement des r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, les copilotes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 cet \u00e2ge, s\u2019ils voulaient rester \u00e0 leur poste, le feraient pour augmenter leur nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es de service et am\u00e9liorer leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Ils atteindraient donc probablement le grade de capitaine avant de prendre leur retraite, qu\u2019ils soient \u00e2g\u00e9s de 62 ou de 66 ans ou peu importe.\n[295] \u00c0 son avis, les hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es par M. Tarapasky dans son mod\u00e8le, \u00e0 savoir que les copilotes resteraient des copilotes et qu\u2019une forte proportion d\u2019entre eux auraient plus de 60 ans, ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement valides, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e2ges diff\u00e9rents et que d\u2019autres facteurs ont eu une incidence sur les promotions.\n[296] Le professeur Kesselman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les pilotes qui sont en haut de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans chaque cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019emploi ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement ceux qui auront plus de 60 ans. L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 Air Canada. Les pilotes peuvent \u00eatre embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e2ges diff\u00e9rents et il pourrait y avoir des personnes qui ont cumul\u00e9 plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, mais qui sont moins \u00e2g\u00e9s et inversement. Davantage de copilotes tendront \u00e0 \u00eatre plus jeunes et, \u00e0 la longue, sans la retraite obligatoire, il serait plus facile de respecter la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[297] Le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky exige des pourcentages beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de copilotes de plus de 60 ans, dans la plupart des cas, 30 %, 40 % ou m\u00eame 50 %, avant qu\u2019il n\u2019aboutisse \u00e0 cette impasse, o\u00f9 il ne peut pas faire l\u2019appariement et ne peut respecter la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[298] Le professeur Kesselman avait \u00e9galement des r\u00e9serves au sujet de l\u2019angle s\u00e9quentiel adopt\u00e9 dans le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky comme s\u2019il essayait d\u2019imiter le syst\u00e8me de postulation tout en essayant de satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019OACI. Il a signal\u00e9 que, tout d\u2019abord, le mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9sente les choix s\u00e9quentiels des capitaines selon leur anciennet\u00e9, puis ce sont les choix s\u00e9quentiels des copilotes en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9.\n[299] Si le commandant de bord est \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de 60 ans, le copilote doit \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans. Les jumelages qui ne satisfont pas \u00e0 cette contrainte sont exclus. Toutefois, les vols long-courriers exigent qu\u2019un pilote suppl\u00e9mentaire soit \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans, selon l\u2019OACI, si le commandant de bord et le copilote sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans.\n[300] Le professeur Kesselman a conclu que la logique du mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky pr\u00e9sente des lacunes fondamentales. Si la logique du mod\u00e8le reposait sur un raisonnement s\u00e9quentiel, M. Tarapasky aurait d\u00fb inclure une autre s\u00e9quence, \u00e0 savoir, la prise en compte du pilote suppl\u00e9mentaire sur les vols long-courriers internationaux.\n[301] Il est vrai, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses remarques sur les pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires, qu\u2019il ignorait que, en 2009, sur le nombre total d\u2019heures de vol d\u2019Air Canada, c\u2019est seulement pour 2 % de ces heures qu\u2019il y a eu ajout de pilotes sur les vols. En outre, M. Tarapasky avait indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019ajout de pilotes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte dans ses exp\u00e9riences, car il s\u2019agit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de copilotes.\n(xiv) Le capitaine Steven Duke [302] Le capitaine Duke occupe le poste de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Ressources de l\u2019\u00e9quipage, chez Air Canada. Il est charg\u00e9 de la gestion des soumissions de candidatures pour les appareils, de l\u2019attribution des heures de vol chaque mois entre les bases et de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du NMHMD en vue de d\u00e9terminer le nombre de pilotes qui effectuent des vols ce mois-l\u00e0.\n[303] Le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019une \u00e9tude qu\u2019il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9e : [traduction] \u00ab Air Canada et les d\u00e9parts \u00e0 la retraite des pilotes, octobre 2009 \u00bb. L\u2019\u00e9tude comprend deux sections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tant le contexte dans lequel se situent les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et qui traite de la structure du groupe des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ainsi que de l\u2019analyse et du processus de postulation du comit\u00e9 directeur de composition des \u00e9quipages.\n[304] La deuxi\u00e8me section fait \u00e9tat de la contrainte excessive impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada et traite de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de celle-ci \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des commandants de bord \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 65 ans de piloter dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien international et int\u00e9rieur, de la capacit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e d\u2019Air Canada d\u2019accommoder les capitaines et les copilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans et du fait que la retraite \u00e0 60 ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9visible et stable.\n[305] Le capitaine Duke a expliqu\u00e9 que les postes de pilote \u00e0 Air Canada se divisent en 16 groupes qui se subdivisent g\u00e9ographiquement en 44 postes. Ces groupes sont les suivants : capitaine, copilote et pilote de rel\u00e8ve de B777; capitaine, copilote et pilote de rel\u00e8ve de A330 ; capitaine, copilote et pilote de rel\u00e8ve de B767, capitaine et copilote de A319\/320\/321; capitaine et copilote de EMJ.\n[306] Le statut de pilote n\u2019est pas interchangeable. Les capitaines ne peuvent pas agir en qualit\u00e9 de copilotes. Ces derniers ne peuvent remplir les fonctions de capitaine. Les pilotes de rel\u00e8ve ne peuvent remplir les fonctions de capitaine ou de copilote. Toutefois, les capitaines et les copilotes peuvent remplir les fonctions de pilote de rel\u00e8ve. Les capitaines et les copilotes sont form\u00e9s pour piloter pendant toutes les phases du vol. Un pilote de rel\u00e8ve ne peut piloter que pendant la partie du vol effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019altitude de croisi\u00e8re.\n[307] L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est d\u2019une importance fondamentale pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. Elle a un rapport avec le poste, et elle d\u00e9termine le statut, l\u2019appareil et la base d\u2019affectation. Les diff\u00e9rents salaires sont associ\u00e9s au statut de l\u2019appareil. Le salaire peut aller du niveau le plus bas, soit 85 000 $\/ann\u00e9e pour un copilote d\u2019Embraer, au niveau le plus haut, soit 244 000 $\/ann\u00e9e pour un capitaine de B777.\n[308] En outre, avoir plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 des horaires mensuels et \u00e0 des horaires de vacances plus favorables. L\u2019horaire de travail mensuel d\u2019un capitaine type de B777 comprend huit jours de vol par mois et une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 les fins de semaine. L\u2019horaire de travail du pilote se situant au milieu des ann\u00e9es d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 comprendrait douze jours de vol par mois et une p\u00e9riode de travail les fins de semaine. Moins il y a d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, moins l\u2019horaire de travail mensuel est favorable.\n[309] Dans la deuxi\u00e8me partie de son t\u00e9moignage, le capitaine Duke a soulev\u00e9 quatre questions. La premi\u00e8re traite de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des capitaines \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 65 ans de piloter dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien international.\n[310] Comme l\u2019ont expliqu\u00e9 messieurs Elfassy et Speer, avant le 23 novembre 2006, la norme de l\u2019annexe 1 de l\u2019OACI n\u2019autorisait pas les commandants de bord d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 piloter un a\u00e9ronef dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger apr\u00e8s 60 ans. Apr\u00e8s le 23 novembre 2006, l\u2019OACI n\u2019autorise pas les commandants de bord d\u2019Air Canada \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 65 ans \u00e0 piloter un a\u00e9ronef dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger.\n[311] Cela a pour effet de diviser les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en diff\u00e9rentes sous-cat\u00e9gories : les commandants de bord, \u00e2g\u00e9s de 65 ans et plus, qui font l\u2019objet de restrictions, les commandants de bord \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 \u00e0 65 ans qui sont susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions et les commandants de bord \u00e2g\u00e9s de moins de 60 ans qui ne font pas l\u2019objet de restrictions; les copilotes de plus de 60 ans qui sont susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions; les copilotes de moins de 60 ans qui ne font pas l\u2019objet de restrictions; les pilotes de rel\u00e8ve qui ne font pas l\u2019objet de restrictions.\n[312] Pour le B777, 93 % des vols sont internationaux et pour le A-330, il s\u2019agit de 90 %. Pour le B767, 80 % des vols sont internationaux, pour le A320, il s\u2019agit de 48 % et de 46 % dans le cas du EMJ. Le capitaine Duke a affirm\u00e9 que les commandants de bord ayant plus de 65 ans ne peuvent effectuer de vol \u00e0 bord des trois gros-porteurs.\n[313] La deuxi\u00e8me question a trait \u00e0 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des commandants de bord \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 65 ans de piloter dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien int\u00e9rieur. Le capitaine Duke entend par vol int\u00e9rieur un vol qui quitte un a\u00e9roport canadien pour atterrir \u00e0 un a\u00e9roport canadien. Le vol international est n\u2019importe o\u00f9 ailleurs. Il a affirm\u00e9 que s\u2019il devait examiner quelque chose, ce devrait \u00eatre les a\u00e9ronefs A320 et EMJ.\n[314] Le probl\u00e8me soulev\u00e9 ici par le capitaine Duke est que 88 % des heures de vol int\u00e9rieur d\u2019Air Canada comportent un survol de l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien am\u00e9ricain. Par exemple, pour desservir Toronto-Montr\u00e9al, l\u2019a\u00e9ronef doit survoler l\u2019\u00c9tat de New York. Pour desservir Toronto\u2011Halifax, l\u2019a\u00e9ronef doit survoler les \u00c9tats de New York, du Vermont, du New Hampshire et du Maine. Pour desservir Toronto-Vancouver, l\u2019a\u00e9ronef doit survoler les \u00c9tats du Michigan, du Wisconsin, du Minnesota, du Dakota du Nord et du Montana.\n[315] Sur les 12 % d\u2019heures de vol restantes, les a\u00e9ronefs d\u2019Air Canada peuvent utiliser un a\u00e9roport de d\u00e9gagement aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Les a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement et le choix de ces a\u00e9roports sont n\u00e9cessaires en raison de conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 destination. Par exemple, pour les vols en direction de Toronto, les a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement retenus sont ceux de Niagara Falls, de New York ou de Buffalo. Pour les vols en direction de Vancouver, l\u2019a\u00e9roport de d\u00e9gagement retenu est celui de Seattle.\n[316] Des a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement ne sont pas retenus pour tous les vols. Tout d\u00e9pend des conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques. Le choix d\u2019a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement a \u00e0 voir avec des conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 destination. Le capitaine Duke ne pouvait r\u00e9pondre avec certitude pour combien de ces 12 % d\u2019heures de vol il fallait choisir des a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement. Cela d\u00e9pend des conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques le jour du vol. Toutefois, si Air Canada n\u2019a pas la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser des a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement am\u00e9ricains, il peut s\u2019ensuivre une annulation du vol ou l\u2019emprunt d\u2019un itin\u00e9raire en direction nord situ\u00e9 \u00e0 des centaines de milles du trajet afin de contourner les conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques d\u00e9favorables.\n[317] En ce qui concerne la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9router les vols int\u00e9rieurs qui survolent les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour rester dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien, le capitaine Duke a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cela a pour effet d\u2019augmenter le temps de vol et les co\u00fbts, et de retarder les vols ult\u00e9rieurs. Par exemple, il a compar\u00e9 le temps utilis\u00e9 et le carburant consomm\u00e9 en utilisant la route la plus optimale de Toronto \u00e0 Halifax au temps utilis\u00e9 et au carburant consomm\u00e9 en utilisant une route situ\u00e9e dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien.\n[318] Le capitaine Duke a estim\u00e9 que le d\u00e9routement des vols hebdomadaires du A320 (117) et du EMJ de Toronto \u00e0 Halifax et de Halifax \u00e0 Toronto entra\u00eenerait des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires de 5,7 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e.\n[319] Air Canada effectue chaque semaine 1 600 vols int\u00e9rieurs en survolant les \u00c9tats-Unis. Le capitaine Duke a estim\u00e9 que, si les vols de l\u2019Airbus A320 suivent le m\u00eame calendrier de vol en ne survolant pas les \u00c9tats-Unis, il faudrait 1 720 heures de vol suppl\u00e9mentaires, 21 \u00e9quipages de vol suppl\u00e9mentaires et la prise en consid\u00e9ration de la disponibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019effectif de r\u00e9serve et des vacances : il s\u2019ensuivrait des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires pour Air Canada de 7,7 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que les co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les vols de la flotte Embraer qui ne survole pas les \u00c9tats-Unis s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8veraient \u00e0 6,6 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e.\n[320] Le capitaine Duke a ensuite abord\u00e9 la troisi\u00e8me question, \u00e0 savoir la capacit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e d\u2019Air Canada d\u2019accommoder les capitaines et les copilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans. Il a fait valoir qu\u2019Air Canada ne peut accommoder qu\u2019un nombre tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9 de pilotes qui sont susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions avant que le calendrier de vol ne devienne ing\u00e9rable sans augmenter les co\u00fbts. Il a produit un certain nombre de graphiques et de tableaux qui donnent un aper\u00e7u des donn\u00e9es sur l\u2019effectif des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en septembre 2009.\n[321] Ils fournissent le nombre et le pourcentage de capitaines et de copilotes par base et par appareil. Par exemple, 91 % (53\/58) des capitaines de B777 bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de 55 ans ou plus. \u00c0 Toronto, 88 % (101\/115) des capitaines sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de 55 ans ou plus. Ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressant est le contraste entre les capitaines et les copilotes. Seulement 26 % (21\/82) des copilotes bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de 55 ans ou plus.\n[322] Le capitaine Duke a ensuite produit un graphique \u00e0 barres sur lequel il a extrapol\u00e9 ces donn\u00e9es pour les ann\u00e9es 2014 et 2019. En faisant ses extrapolations, il a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait aucun d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, que 100 % des pilotes resteraient en poste. Il a affirm\u00e9 que ces extrapolations repr\u00e9sentent le pire sc\u00e9nario et ne font que rappeler la limite maximum de responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada.\n[323] Le but de toute cette information n\u2019est pas clair. Questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, le capitaine Duke a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Vous savez quoi? Pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate, je souhaiterais avoir laiss\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9 tous les trucs d\u00e9mographiques. Je ne pense pas que cela ajoute beaucoup [\u2026] Je ne pense pas que ces preuves ajoutent beaucoup de valeur parce qu\u2019elles ne pr\u00e9voient pas n\u00e9cessairement ce qui se produira r\u00e9ellement et elles ne pr\u00e9voient pas non plus ce que seront les donn\u00e9es sur les effectifs d\u2019Air Canada dans 10 ans \u00bb. Il a conclu que les exp\u00e9riences de M. Tarapasky \u00e9taient beaucoup plus instructives que ses preuves d\u00e9mographiques.\n[324] Le capitaine Duke a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon lui, le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky est compl\u00e8tement ind\u00e9pendant des donn\u00e9es sur l\u2019effectif des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada que ce soit actuellement ou dans 10, 20 ou 30 ans. Ce mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9voit simplement un nombre possible qui peut \u00eatre atteint \u00e0 tout moment dans l\u2019avenir et ce qui arriverait au SPFP ainsi qu\u2019au processus mensuel si certains des pilotes susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions devaient occuper ces postes.\n[325] Le capitaine Duke a comment\u00e9 les co\u00fbts que devrait assumer \u00e9ventuellement Air Canada si 80 % des CA et 20 % des copilotes \u00e9taient susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions, une situation qui, dans le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky, ne g\u00e9n\u00e9rerait aucune solution. Le capitaine Duke a affirm\u00e9 que pour effectuer le vol en question, l\u2019un des pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans devra \u00eatre retir\u00e9 du jumelage pour \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 par un autre pilote \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 60 ans. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de temps de vol pour le pilote exclu, il toucherait le MMG, mais ne travaillerait pas. Si Air Canada devait donner de l\u2019avancement \u00e0 un pilote, d\u2019un point de vue r\u00e9aliste et fonctionnel, un cours de formation devra \u00eatre dispens\u00e9.\n[326] Il devrait y avoir dotation par un rempla\u00e7ant et, par la suite, Air Canada devrait embaucher un nouveau pilote. Le capitaine Duke a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il faudrait au total sept cours de formation, y compris l\u2019embauche d\u2019un nouvel employ\u00e9. Le co\u00fbt moyen d\u2019un cours est de 43 000 $, le co\u00fbt total de la formation s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8verait donc \u00e0 300 000 $. S\u2019ajoute \u00e0 ce co\u00fbt le versement du plein salaire du pilote pendant qu\u2019il est en formation.\n[327] Il a convenu que des pilotes de r\u00e9serve ayant la qualification n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appareil pourraient remplacer le pilote exclu. Cependant, cela r\u00e9duirait la disponibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019effectif de r\u00e9serve et les pilotes concern\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre remplac\u00e9s, sinon on augmente le risque op\u00e9rationnel en r\u00e9duisant le nombre de pilotes de r\u00e9serve.\n[328] Le capitaine Duke a aussi trait\u00e9 du sujet relatif \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de membres \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipage. Les pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires sont presque exclusivement des copilotes. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, un temps de vol de plus de quatorze heures exige un \u00e9quipage compos\u00e9 de quatre membres, en ajoutant un pilote suppl\u00e9mentaire. Seul le B777 dispose d\u2019un \u00e9quipage auquel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s des pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires et environ 14 % de tous les vols du B777 ont des pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires. En tenant compte de l\u2019ensemble des op\u00e9rations d\u2019Air Canada, il ressort que les pilotes suppl\u00e9mentaires sont seulement sur 2,5 % des vols. Environ 22 % de tous les vols du B777 sont effectu\u00e9s avec des pilotes de rel\u00e8ve et 7 % de tous les vols d\u2019Air Canada sont effectu\u00e9s avec \u00e0 bord des pilotes de rel\u00e8ve.\n[329] La quatri\u00e8me question abord\u00e9e par le capitaine Duke a trait \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans \u00e0 Air Canada. Du 25 mai 1992 \u00e0 juin 2009, plus de 90 % des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Il n\u2019y a donc pas beaucoup de doute quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel les pilotes prennent leur retraite. Ces donn\u00e9es incluent les retraites anticip\u00e9es et les personnes qui quittent la compagnie a\u00e9rienne pour une raison quelconque. Elles incluent \u00e9galement les pilotes qui ont particip\u00e9 aux programmes d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e.\n[330] Le capitaine Duke a expliqu\u00e9 que chaque d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite inattendu (sans pr\u00e9avis) affecte n\u00e9gativement les op\u00e9rations d\u2019Air Canada et se traduit par des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires. Remplacer cette personne peut prendre une p\u00e9riode de formation compl\u00e8te, soit un minimum de deux mois. En outre, le remplacement peut n\u00e9cessiter le processus d\u2019analyse complet du CDCE avant qu\u2019une personne ne soit affect\u00e9e au nouveau poste. Cela peut compromettre la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 op\u00e9rer ses activit\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te.\n[331] Selon son t\u00e9moignage, s\u2019il y avait plus de six d\u00e9parts \u00e0 la retraite inattendus sur trois mois dans la cohorte des capitaines du B777, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, cela pourrait entra\u00eener des annulations de vols et une perte d\u2019environ 2,5 millions de dollars en revenus. Cela ne serait pas un probl\u00e8me si le Tribunal ordonnait que les pilotes doivent donner un pr\u00e9avis de d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite dans un d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cis. Le capitaine Duke a reconnu que des incitations \u00e9conomiques pourraient aider \u00e0 encourager cela.\nD. Alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP et Meiorin [332] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une d\u00e9fense contre toute accusation de discrimination si l\u2019employeur d\u00e9montre que \u00ab les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences [\u2026] d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es \u00bb (EPJ).\n[333] La m\u00e9thode \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019employeur a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une EPJ est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin).\n[334] Un employeur doit \u00e9tablir ce qui suit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\n1) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause. L\u2019analyse porte ici non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet;\n2) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n3) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019accommoder les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n[335] La Cour supr\u00eame a att\u00e9nu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00ab impossibilit\u00e9 \u00bb de la m\u00e9thode en trois \u00e9tapes dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 561, en affirmant que ce n\u2019est pas la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer un employ\u00e9 qui ne respecte pas une norme, mais bien la preuve d\u2019une contrainte excessive qui, elle, peut prendre autant de formes qu\u2019il y a de circonstances.\nE. Alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et paragraphe 15(2) et l\u2019APAC [336] Les plaignants font valoir que, selon la formulation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le principe expression unius est exclusio alterius (l\u2019expression de l\u2019un implique l\u2019exclusion de l\u2019autre), seul l\u2019employeur, et non une organisation syndicale telle que l\u2019APAC, peut se pr\u00e9valoir du moyen de d\u00e9fense relatif aux EPJ. Un syndicat peut fournir des preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui du moyen de d\u00e9fense de l\u2019employeur fond\u00e9 sur les EPJ, mais il ne peut le faire pour lui-m\u00eame. L\u2019unique r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019employeur \u00bb dans la m\u00e9thode Meiorin donne du poids \u00e0 cet argument. Un appui suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cette position est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)f) de la LCDP, o\u00f9 une organisation syndicale ainsi qu\u2019un employeur peuvent se pr\u00e9valoir du moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur les EPJ.\n[337] Bien que ce soit tentant, finalement, je n\u2019admets pas cet argument pour deux raisons. Ces plaintes renvoient aux articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Si un acte discriminatoire peut \u00eatre commis, aux termes de l\u2019article 10, par un employeur, une organisation syndicale ou une association patronale, comment est-ce possible que, de ces trois parties, seul l\u2019employeur peut invoquer un moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur les EPJ. Cela n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s judicieux sur le plan politique ou encore, \u00e7a ne para\u00eet tr\u00e8s logique.\n[338] Deuxi\u00e8mement, je m\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970 (Renaud) o\u00f9 une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019employeur et le syndicat. Ce dernier a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter les mesures d\u2019accommodement propos\u00e9es par l\u2019employeur en raison de leurs effets sur d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s.\n[339] La Cour a signal\u00e9 que le syndicat peut devenir partie \u00e0 une discrimination en participant \u00e0 la formulation de la r\u00e8gle de travail qui a un effet discriminatoire sur le plaignant, notamment si la r\u00e8gle fait partie de la convention collective.\n[340] La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que, en pareil cas, le syndicat encourt une responsabilit\u00e9 (aux termes de la B.C. Human Rights Act qui pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur les EPJ) et qu\u2019il doit poss\u00e9der le m\u00eame droit qu\u2019un employeur de justifier la discrimination. Pour ce faire, il doit s\u2019acquitter de son obligation d\u2019accommodement.\n[341] Toutefois, les plaignants font valoir que, m\u00eame si l\u2019APAC peut pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur les EPJ ind\u00e9pendamment d\u2019Air Canada, elle n\u2019est pas parvenue \u00e0 satisfaire au crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans Meiorin.\n[342] Selon l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019APAC relativement \u00e0 l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, cette derni\u00e8re a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 une convention collective qui accordait \u00e0 ses membres la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement assur\u00e9es, une augmentation des salaires et un revenu de pension important. Tous ces avantages sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Le m\u00e9canisme que l\u2019APAC a retenu pour r\u00e9partir les avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable pour tous les pilotes \u00e9tait d\u2019inclure une exigence relative \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire.\n[343] Si ce que les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada font essentiellement, c\u2019est \u00eatre aux commandes d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de taille et de type divers et de transporter des voyageurs vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales, il est difficile de voir de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019\u00e2ge du pilote a une quelconque relation avec l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions.\n[344] Il est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que Transports Canada, l\u2019organisme de r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9ral responsable de la d\u00e9livrance de licences aux pilotes de l\u2019aviation commerciale, n\u2019impose aucune restriction en mati\u00e8re de limite d\u2019\u00e2ge. En fait, dans sa pr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 l\u2019OACI sur la question du rel\u00e8vement de l\u2019\u00e2ge maximal pour les commandants de bord qui effectuent des vols internationaux, la position du Canada \u00e9tait qu\u2019il ne devrait pas y avoir de limite d\u2019\u00e2ge. Le Canada n\u2019a pas d\u2019objections \u00e0 ce que les pilotes ayant 60 ans ou plus, titulaires d\u2019une licence m\u00e9dicalement valide, pilotent un avion dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien.\n[345] Concernant la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la m\u00e9thode Meiorin, je ne doute pas que la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans ait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser un but l\u00e9gitime. Toutefois, si elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser un but li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, elle ne peut pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif li\u00e9 au travail.\n[346] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019APAC n\u2019a pas satisfait aux \u00e9tapes un et deux de la m\u00e9thode Meiorin. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019APAC ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir du moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur les EPJ qui est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP.\n[347] Dans le cas de l\u2019APAC, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape trois de la m\u00e9thode Meiorin, mais il est n\u00e9anmoins prudent que j\u2019examine la preuve produite par l\u2019APAC pour appuyer sa position selon laquelle l\u2019\u00e9limination de la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans imposerait une contrainte excessive sur un grand nombre de ses membres.\n[348] Auparavant, j\u2019aimerais aborder la question relative aux facteurs que le Tribunal peut prendre en compte en \u00e9valuant si une EPJ a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S., la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 les facteurs permettant de mesurer la contrainte excessive. Il s\u2019agit notamment du co\u00fbt financier, de l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la convention collective, du moral du personnel et de l\u2019interchangeabilit\u00e9 des effectifs et des installations. La Cour a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 que cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration ne se voulait pas exhaustive. (Voir \u00e9galement McGill University Health Centre c. S.E.H.G.M., 2007 CSC 4.)\n[349] En 1998, la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 15(2) qui pr\u00e9cisait que les facteurs \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration \u00e9taient la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les co\u00fbts. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a signal\u00e9 que les facteurs pertinents ne sont pas enracin\u00e9s, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont inclus ou \u00e9cart\u00e9s express\u00e9ment par la loi.\n[350] Avec le paragraphe 15(2), le Parlement a express\u00e9ment inclus les facteurs pertinents qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans la d\u00e9termination de la contrainte excessive. S\u2019ils sont appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau, le principe expression unius est exclusio alterius (l\u2019expression de l\u2019un implique l\u2019exclusion de l\u2019autre) et celui selon lequel les moyens des d\u00e9fenses limitant l\u2019exercice des droits de la personne conf\u00e9r\u00e9s en vertu de la loi sur les droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s dans un sens \u00e9troit. Force est de conclure que les facteurs \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019analyse de la contrainte excessive sont limit\u00e9s \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et aux co\u00fbts.\n[351] La position de l\u2019APAC est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autres moyens pour tenir compte des besoins des plaignants, outre celui d\u2019\u00e9liminer la r\u00e8gle de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans. Agir de la sorte imposerait une contrainte excessive sur l\u2019APAC.\n(xv) Rikk Salamat [352] APAC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 Rikk Salamat comme un expert en analyse des conventions collectives et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce dernier devait t\u00e9moigner au sujet des revenus de carri\u00e8re potentiels des pilotes de ligne si la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans est \u00e9limin\u00e9e. Il a produit un rapport dat\u00e9 d\u2019octobre 2009 qui expose sa m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse et ses conclusions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n[353] Selon les conclusions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de M. Salamat, l\u2019\u00e9limination de la retraite obligatoire procure clairement un avantage financier \u00e0 14 % des pilotes actifs d\u2019Air Canada. Les 86 % restants auront \u00e0 travailler apr\u00e8s 60 ans pour maintenir le niveau de revenus potentiels qu\u2019ils gagneraient si la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans continuait de s\u2019appliquer. Pour certaines personnes de ce dernier groupe, la diminution des revenus de carri\u00e8re est relativement faible par rapport aux avantages financiers que procure le fait de pouvoir travailler apr\u00e8s 60 ans.\n[354] Pour 29 % des 86 % de pilotes, travailler apr\u00e8s 60 ans leur procurerait peu de gains suppl\u00e9mentaires. En outre, 1% des pilotes ne recevraient aucun avantage \u00e0 travailler plus longtemps. Ces r\u00e9sultats figurent dans les donn\u00e9es ci-dessous o\u00f9 M. Salamat a regroup\u00e9 les pilotes actifs en quatre cat\u00e9gories qui illustrent ses conclusions.\n\u27a2 Groupe 1 : 14 % des pilotes actifs - [traduction] \u00ab aucun risque \u00bb. Ces pilotes ne subiront aucune perte de revenus de carri\u00e8re qu\u2019ils travaillent ou non apr\u00e8s 60 ans.\n\u27a2 Groupe 2 : 57 % des pilotes actifs - [traduction] \u00ab risque mod\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb. Ce groupe de pilotes verra son avancement professionnel retard\u00e9. Les r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res de ce retard peuvent \u00eatre compens\u00e9es par la poursuite des activit\u00e9s professionnelles apr\u00e8s 60 ans. Toutefois, la perte de revenus qu\u2019ils subiraient s\u2019ils prenaient leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans est inf\u00e9rieure aux avantages qu\u2019ils retireraient s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019au m\u00eame \u00e2ge en moyenne que les autres pilotes.\n\u27a2 Groupe 3 : 28 % des pilotes actifs - [traduction] \u00ab risque important \u00bb. \u00c0 l\u2019instar du groupe 2, ces pilotes verront leur avancement professionnel retard\u00e9, lequel peut \u00eatre compens\u00e9 par la poursuite des activit\u00e9s professionnelles apr\u00e8s 60 ans. Toutefois, la perte de revenus qu\u2019ils subiraient s\u2019ils prenaient leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans est sup\u00e9rieure aux avantages qu\u2019ils retireraient s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019au m\u00eame \u00e2ge en moyenne que les autres pilotes.\n\u27a2 Groupe 4 : 1 % des pilotes actifs - [traduction] \u00ab aucun avantage \u00bb. Ce groupe de pilotes subira une r\u00e9duction de leurs revenus de carri\u00e8re m\u00eame s\u2019ils travaillent pendant autant d\u2019ann\u00e9es que les autres pilotes apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que les pertes \u00e0 court terme que ces pilotes devront assumer en raison des possibilit\u00e9s de promotion perdues sont assez importantes et leurs ann\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires de revenu sont assez \u00e9loign\u00e9es dans le futur, de sorte que ce dernier facteur ne peut pas compenser enti\u00e8rement le premier facteur.\n[355] Aux fins de son mod\u00e8le d\u2019analyse, M. Salamat a commenc\u00e9 avec tous les pilotes figurant sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en janvier 2009 et a fait une extrapolation sur un an. Il a \u00e9limin\u00e9 tous les pilotes qui auraient eu 60 ans au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 et a attribu\u00e9 leurs postes, par ordre d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, aux pilotes ayant moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Ce processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les 35 ann\u00e9es suivantes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que tous les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada qui sont inscrits sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 aient pris leur retraite.\n[356] Pour calculer les r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res, le mod\u00e8le \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9chelle salariale de juillet 2008 et sur un nombre d\u2019heures travaill\u00e9es de 80 heures par mois, et a appliqu\u00e9 un taux d\u2019actualisation de 3 % sur les gains futurs pour estimer la valeur actualis\u00e9e nette (van) des revenus de carri\u00e8re totaux.\n[357] Le mod\u00e8le \u00e9tablissait ensuite cinq sc\u00e9narios diff\u00e9rents fond\u00e9s sur des \u00e2ges de la retraite moyens pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s allant de 61 \u00e0 65 au lieu de 60 ans. Plut\u00f4t que de produire une donn\u00e9e pour tous les sc\u00e9narios, M. Salamat a choisi 63 ans comme \u00e2ge moyen pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la retraite. Quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi il a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 cet \u00e2ge, M. Salamat a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il travaille avec des pilotes provenant d\u2019un certain nombre de compagnies a\u00e9riennes am\u00e9ricaines et les donn\u00e9es semblent indiquer que les pilotes qui restent en poste apr\u00e8s 60 ans travaillent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans. Il a ajout\u00e9 que cela repose sur les tendances relatives \u00e0 la retraite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour et sur certaines \u00e9tudes actuarielles, et qu\u2019il a attest\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat signal\u00e9 par les pilotes dans divers sondages.\n[358] Il n\u2019a pas produit les mod\u00e8les, \u00e9tudes ou enqu\u00eates. Il n\u2019a pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve factuelle pour appuyer ses dires, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas encore de pilotes aux \u00c9tats-Unis qui sont rest\u00e9s en poste jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans. La loi am\u00e9ricaine augmentant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 65 ans n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2007. Cependant, \u00e0 un niveau agr\u00e9g\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e2ge importe peu dans la mesure o\u00f9 tout le monde part \u00e0 la retraite au m\u00eame \u00e2ge.\n[359] M. Salamat ne pr\u00e9tendait pas conna\u00eetre la r\u00e9ponse ou avoir une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9finitive quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada prendraient leur retraite apr\u00e8s 60 ans, si la retraite n\u2019est pas obligatoire. Il n\u2019a pas non plus affirm\u00e9 que le mod\u00e8le pouvait pr\u00e9dire le choix que les pilotes feraient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la poursuite de leurs activit\u00e9s professionnelles apr\u00e8s cet \u00e2ge.\n[360] Le premier sc\u00e9nario r\u00e9v\u00e8le, par ann\u00e9e et selon l\u2019\u00e2ge atteint en 2010, l\u2019effet cumulatif, par ann\u00e9e et selon l\u2019\u00e2ge atteint en 2010, de l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite de 60 \u00e0 63 ans sur la van des revenus de carri\u00e8re. Pour les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 55 \u00e0 59 ans, l\u2019effet cumulatif en 2018 est une van positive de 470 000 $. Aucun effet n\u00e9gatif n\u2019est li\u00e9 au d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[361] Les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 50 \u00e0 54 ans, en 2013, obtiendraient une van n\u00e9gative de 70 000 $, si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est \u00e0 60 ans, mais obtiendraient une van positive de 328 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est de 63 ans. Pour le groupe d\u2019\u00e2ge 45 \u00e0 49 ans, la van positive se chiffrerait \u00e0 231 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans contre une van n\u00e9gative de 116 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Sur le plan de la comparaison van positive\/van n\u00e9gative, il en est de m\u00eame pour les groupes d\u2019\u00e2ge 45 \u00e0 49 et 40 \u00e0 44 sauf que l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019\u00e9cart diminue avec chaque groupe plus jeune.\n[362] C\u2019est seulement avec les pilotes les moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, soit ceux appartenant aux groupes d\u2019\u00e2ge 35 \u00e0 39, 30 \u00e0 34 et 25 \u00e0 29, que l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019effet n\u00e9gatif sur la van des revenus \u00e0 un \u00e2ge de la retraite de 60 ans est plus grand qu\u2019une van positive des revenus \u00e0 63 ans. Ce dernier cas s\u2019explique par le fait que, rendus \u00e0 cet \u00e2ge, le seul effet ressenti par les pilotes est celui des retards. Chaque ann\u00e9e, graduellement, ils accusent un l\u00e9ger retard qui est de plus en plus marqu\u00e9.\n[363] Le deuxi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario examinait l\u2019effet potentiel moyen, selon l\u2019\u00e2ge atteint en 2010, sur la van des revenus de carri\u00e8re totaux, avec un \u00e2ge moyen de la retraite qui passe de 60 ans \u00e0 celui de 61 \u00e0 65 ans. Le graphique r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, pour un pilote \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans en 2010, la van de ses revenus de carri\u00e8re totaux, s\u2019il travaillait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63, pourrait atteindre 560 000 $. Cette personne ne subirait aucun effet n\u00e9gatif li\u00e9 \u00e0 la perte de revenus, s\u2019il prenait sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans.\n[364] Un pilote de 55 ans obtiendrait une van de 425 000 $ \u00e0 63 ans, mais elle aurait un effet n\u00e9gatif en raison d\u2019une perte d\u2019environ 100 000 $. C\u2019est dans le cas des pilotes plus jeunes et moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s que l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019effet n\u00e9gatif sur la van des revenus est de loin sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019effet positif. Un pilote de 27 ans subirait une perte de 227 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 60 ans et r\u00e9aliserait un gain de 10 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 63 ans.\n[365] Le troisi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario examine la van, selon le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, pour chaque ann\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire travaill\u00e9e, si l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe de 60 ans \u00e0 61 \u00e0 65 ans. Il ressort une forte corr\u00e9lation entre l\u2019\u00e2ge et l\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Toutefois, M. Salamat a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019en va pas toujours ainsi. Vous pouvez \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 et \u00eatre en haut de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, et vous pouvez \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 et \u00eatre en bas de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Vous ne pouvez pas \u00eatre jeune et avoir de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience.\n[366] Pour un pilote qui est le premier sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, le fait de travailler une autre ann\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 63 ans lui donnerait une van de 200 000 $ sans van n\u00e9gative si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 60 ans. Un pilote ayant le num\u00e9ro 1 500 sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 obtiendrait une van positive d\u2019environ 100 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 63 ans et une van n\u00e9gative d\u2019environ 45 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 60 ans.\n[367] Dans le cas d\u2019un pilote ayant peu d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 (num\u00e9ro 3 500), le fait de travailler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans lui donnerait une van de 15 000 $ et, s\u2019il prenait sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans, il obtiendrait une van n\u00e9gative de 71 000 $.\n[368] Le quatri\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario montre l\u2019effet potentiel, selon le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, sur la van des revenus de carri\u00e8re totaux, lorsque l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe de 60 \u00e0 63 ans. Pour le pilote le plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9, qui figure en premier sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, si l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe \u00e0 63 ans, la van totale des gains suppl\u00e9mentaires serait de 597 000 $ sans cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9gative si la retraite est fix\u00e9e \u00e0 60 ans.\n[369] Le pilote ayant le num\u00e9ro 1 000 sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 obtiendrait une van totale d\u2019environ 395 000 $ si la retraite est \u00e0 63 ans et une van n\u00e9gative de 100 000 $ si la retraite est \u00e0 60 ans. Un pilote d\u00e9butant ayant le num\u00e9ro 3 000 sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qui prend sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans obtiendrait une van n\u00e9gative de 215 000 $ et celle-ci serait n\u00e9gative de 2 000 $ s\u2019il travaillait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 63 ans.\n[370] Le cinqui\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario analyse l\u2019effet potentiel, selon le poste du pilote, sur la van des revenus de carri\u00e8re, lorsque l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe de 60 \u00e0 61 \u00e0 65 ans. Aux fins de cette analyse, les pilotes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9s selon le poste qu\u2019ils occupaient en septembre 2009. Les postes sont organis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on hi\u00e9rarchique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils vont du poste le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans la hi\u00e9rarchie aux postes subalternes.\n[371] En commen\u00e7ant avec les 190 copilotes d\u2019Embraer touchant le taux salarial le plus bas, le sc\u00e9nario montre que, si ces derniers travaillaient jusqu\u2019\u00e0 63 ans, les avantages s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8veraient \u00e0 51 000 $. Pour le capitaine de B777, la van des avantages li\u00e9s au fait de travailler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 586 000 $.\n[372] Pour le copilote d\u2019Embraer, le co\u00fbt du d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite \u00e0 60 ans serait une van n\u00e9gative de 222 000 $ et le capitaine d\u2019un B777 n\u2019aura \u00e0 assumer aucun co\u00fbt. Le capitaine d\u2019Embraer enregistrerait un gain de 230 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 63 ans et une perte de 18 000 $ si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est 60 ans.\n[373] Le sixi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario est un diagramme de dispersion montrant l\u2019effet sur la van des revenus de carri\u00e8re si l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe de 60 \u00e0 63 ans. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une illustration graphique des quatre groupes de pilotes auxquels il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence plus t\u00f4t.\n[374] M. Salamat a ensuite produit un tableau montrant l\u2019effet sur le revenu moyen des cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de travail avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite de 60 ans. Il a suppos\u00e9 que la pension reposait sur la moyenne des cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de salaire. (La pension d\u2019Air Canada repose sur les 60 meilleurs mois cons\u00e9cutifs).\n[375] M. Salamat a expliqu\u00e9 que, tandis que les sc\u00e9narios pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents illustraient ce qui se passe pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi, ce tableau vise \u00e0 montrer l\u2019effet sur les gains admissibles si le pilote d\u00e9cide de prendre sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans lorsque l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite passe \u00e0 61 \u00e0 65 ans.\n[376] Ce que le tableau conclut finalement, c\u2019est que l\u2019effet, en moyenne, sur le revenu aux fins de la pension d\u2019un pilote est une van de 3 762 $, ce qui veut dire 3 % de moins s\u2019il prend sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans lorsque l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite est augment\u00e9 \u00e0 61 ans. Si l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite passe \u00e0 63 ans et si le pilote moyen prend sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans, lorsque l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen de la retraite est augment\u00e9 \u00e0 63 ans, l\u2019effet sera une van n\u00e9gative de 13 900 $, ce qui veut dire 8 % de moins aux fins de la pension. Et ainsi de suite, pour un \u00e2ge de la retraite de 62, 64 et 65 ans.\n[377] Enfin, M. Salamat a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un tableau appel\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab soumissions de candidatures pour les appareils \u2013 \u00e2ge \u00e0 la fermeture des soumissions (janvier 2009) \u00bb. Ce tableau indique le nombre de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ainsi que leur \u00e2ge minimum, m\u00e9dian, moyen et maximum par poste en janvier 2009. J\u2019ai fait allusion \u00e0 seulement certaines donn\u00e9es sur les postes, plus particuli\u00e8rement, aux postes mentionn\u00e9s par M. Tarapasky et par le capitaine Duke dans leur t\u00e9moignage sur les jumelages.\n[378] Selon ce tableau, il y avait 109 capitaines de B777, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Toronto, en janvier 2009.

L\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00e9dian \u00e9tait de 48 ans et l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen, de 47 ans. L\u2019\u00e2ge maximum des 78 copilotes bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tait de 58 ans et l\u2019\u00e2ge minimum, de 32,2 ans.

L\u2019\u00e2ge maximum des copilotes bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Winnipeg \u00e9tait de 54,2 ans et l\u2019\u00e2ge minimum, de 37,6 ans. L\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00e9dian \u00e9tait de 46 ans et l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen, de 45 ans.\n[391] L\u2019\u00e2ge maximum des capitaines de EMJ pour ces diff\u00e9rentes bases variait de 54,4 \u00e0 57,9 ans. L\u2019\u00e2ge minimum variait de 30 \u00e0 34,2 ans. Les copilotes de EMJ avaient un \u00e2ge maximum variant de 50,6 \u00e0 51,2 ans. L\u2019\u00e2ge minimum variait de 25,9 \u00e0 28 ans.\n[392] Manifestement, la tendance qui se d\u00e9gage de ces sc\u00e9narios est que l\u2019incidence relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination de la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans suit l\u2019\u00e2ge et plus encore l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes. Si la r\u00e8gle de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans est abolie, les pilotes des groupes 1, 2 et 3 peuvent d\u00e9cider de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans. Les pilotes du groupe 1, qui repr\u00e9sentent 14 % des pilotes actifs, ne subiront aucune perte de revenu et r\u00e9aliseront des gains importants en travaillant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge 63 ans.\n[393] Les pilotes du groupe 2, qui comptent 57 % des pilotes actifs, subiront une perte de revenus parce que leur avancement professionnel sera retard\u00e9. Toutefois, s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans, les gains qu\u2019ils r\u00e9aliseront seront sup\u00e9rieurs aux pertes.\n[394] Les pilotes du groupe 3, qui comptent 28 % des pilotes actifs, subiront une perte de revenus parce que leur avancement professionnel sera retard\u00e9. Toutefois, s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans, les gains qu\u2019ils r\u00e9aliseront seront inf\u00e9rieurs aux pertes.\n[395] C\u2019est le groupe 4, qui compte les pilotes les moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, qui subira les cons\u00e9quences les plus n\u00e9gatives si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans est \u00e9limin\u00e9. Ils constituent 1 % des pilotes actifs. Ils subiront une perte importante s\u2019ils choisissent de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans et continueront d\u2019enregistrer une tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re perte qui peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duite au point d\u2019avoir un effet neutre s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans.\nF. Conclusion portant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP en ce qui concerne l\u2019APAC [396] Il est vrai que l\u2019abolition de la r\u00e8gle de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans aurait un effet disproportionn\u00e9 sur les jeunes pilotes. Il ne fait aucun doute que les plaignants au cours de leur carri\u00e8re au sein d\u2019Air Canada ont accept\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle m\u00eame qu\u2019ils cherchent maintenant \u00e0 renverser et qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9s par celle-ci. Toutefois, l\u2019acquiescement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher les plaignants de faire valoir leurs droits en vertu de la LCDP \u00e0 \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre toute discrimination. Le principe de la conduite irr\u00e9prochable n\u2019est pas un facteur att\u00e9nuant \u00e0 tout le moins en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de la responsabilit\u00e9.\n[397] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019adjectif \u00ab excessive \u00bb suppose qu\u2019une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Les mesures que l\u2019auteur de la discrimination doit prendre pour s\u2019entendre avec le plaignant sont limit\u00e9es par les expressions \u201craisonnables\u201d et \u201csans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive\u201d. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 non pas de crit\u00e8res ind\u00e9pendants, mais de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons d\u2019exprimer le m\u00eame concept \u00bb.\n[398] La question est la suivante : dans quelle mesure la contrainte est-elle acceptable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce? Sur le nombre total des pilotes actifs employ\u00e9s par Air Canada en janvier 2009, 99 % d\u2019entre eux vont r\u00e9aliser des gains en travaillant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans. Il ne fait aucun doute que les pilotes plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s seraient avantag\u00e9s dans une grande mesure, les avantages \u00e9tant d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par les niveaux d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 relatifs. L\u2019inconv\u00e9nient pour les pilotes moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, c\u2019est que les gains qu\u2019ils r\u00e9aliseront auront un effet n\u00e9gatif sur leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans.\n[399] Les r\u00e9percussions les plus importantes seraient sur les pilotes ayant le moins d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Ils subiraient une perte importante de revenus si l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e9tait de 60 ans et, au mieux, ne retireraient aucun avantage m\u00eame s\u2019ils travaillent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans.\n[400] Si un certain degr\u00e9 de contrainte est acceptable, cette contrainte s\u2019appliquerait-elle aux pilotes dont la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler au sein d\u2019Air Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e \u00e0 60 ans pour la simple raison qu\u2019ils avaient atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Ou cette contrainte s\u2019appliquerait-elle \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes qui auraient dor\u00e9navant une capacit\u00e9 plus limit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans, mais qui seraient encore dans une situation de gains s\u2019ils travaillaient jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 63 ans. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de sous-estimer les r\u00e9percussions plus importantes sur les pilotes ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, n\u00e9anmoins, pr\u00e9cisons que ce groupe de pilotes ne repr\u00e9sente que 1 % de la cohorte totale des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[401] Le choix est difficile. \u00c0 mon avis, cependant, les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019abolition de la r\u00e8gle de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans n\u2019atteignent pas le seuil de la contrainte \u00ab excessive \u00bb. J'ai conclu, par cons\u00e9quent, que l\u2019APAC n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la m\u00e9thode Meiorin.\nG. Alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et Air Canada [402] Les deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de la m\u00e9thode Meiorin requi\u00e8rent une \u00e9valuation de la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par la norme et de la bonne foi de l\u2019employeur dans l\u2019adoption de cette norme. Les parties ne contestent pas vraiment cela puisque leur d\u00e9saccord porte plut\u00f4t sur la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, soit celle des mesures d\u2019accommodement obligatoires.\n[403] Selon le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Air Canada, 86 % des vols de cette derni\u00e8re sont internationaux, y compris ceux qui comportent un survol de l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien am\u00e9ricain en route vers des destinations canadiennes. Sur les 14 % restants, il ressort que, dans le cas de 20 \u00e0 25 % de ces vols, les a\u00e9ronefs d\u2019Air Canada doivent utiliser des a\u00e9roports de d\u00e9gagement am\u00e9ricains. \u00catre en mesure de voler l\u00e9galement dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger fait partie int\u00e9grante du travail des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. En raison des normes de l\u2019OACI qui imposent des restrictions sur l\u2019\u00e2ge des pilotes en ce qui concerne les vols internationaux, Air Canada affirme qu\u2019elle ne peut prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans sans contrainte excessive.\n[404] Il incombe \u00e0 Air Canada de d\u00e9montrer que, s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019\u00e2ge obligatoire pour le d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite de ses pilotes, les co\u00fbts relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de la compagnie a\u00e9rienne imposeraient une contrainte excessive. Les plaignants ne demandent pas qu\u2019Air Canada adopte des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019intention notamment des commandants de bord de plus de 65 ans. Ils soutiennent plut\u00f4t qu\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne peut pas r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 \u00e0 65 ans.\n[405] Les dates de la retraite des plaignants s\u2019\u00e9chelonnent sur la p\u00e9riode 2005-2009. Les modifications aux normes de l\u2019OACI ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es le 23 novembre 2006, soit au cours de la p\u00e9riode des d\u00e9parts \u00e0 la retraite des plaignants. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question des besoins d\u2019accommodement doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le 23 novembre 2006 afin de tenir compte des pilotes qui ont pris leur retraite avant cette date. La question doit aussi \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 novembre 2006 afin de tenir compte des pilotes qui ont pris leur retraite apr\u00e8s cette date et parce que les plaignants demandent d\u2019invalider la r\u00e8gle obligatoire pour tous les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[406] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait utile d\u2019examiner la proc\u00e9dure, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer la question de l\u2019accommodement et le contenu substantiel d\u2019une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert ou les raisons de l\u2019employeur pour ne pas offrir une telle norme.\n[407] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9 si l\u2019employeur a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019effet discriminatoire ou s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas une mani\u00e8re moins discriminatoire d\u2019effectuer le travail tout en r\u00e9alisant l\u2019objet l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019employeur.\n[408] Les plaignants n\u2019avaient pas besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, \u00e2ge auquel ils \u00e9taient tenus de prendre leur retraite. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Tarapasky et le capitaine Duke avait trait principalement aux probl\u00e8mes auxquels faisait face Air Canada en l\u2019absence de la r\u00e8gle de 60 ans apr\u00e8s les modifications apport\u00e9es par l\u2019OACI.\n[409] Toutefois, Air Canada n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve concr\u00e8te expliquant pourquoi elle ne pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de tous les copilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans avant novembre 2006. Dans la norme de l\u2019OACI, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que celle-ci emp\u00eachait les copilotes d\u2019effectuer des vols internationaux si ceux-ci satisfaisaient aux exigences de Transports Canada en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9livrance de licences.\n[410] En ce qui concerne les capitaines d\u2019Air Canada qui pilotent des a\u00e9ronefs empruntant des routes internationales, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des commandants de bord, avant novembre 2006, aucune restriction en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9livrance de licences ni aucune restriction op\u00e9rationnelle n\u2019\u00e9taient impos\u00e9es par Air Canada qui les auraient emp\u00each\u00e9s d\u2019occuper d\u2019autres postes de pilote tels que celui de copilote.\n[411] Air Canada n\u2019a pas propos\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019accommodement et n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9tabli une proc\u00e9dure en vue de chercher \u00e0 trouver des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui auraient pu avoir un effet moins discriminatoire. Pour ces motifs, je conclus qu\u2019Air Canada ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 tout le moins pendant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant novembre 2006.\n[412] La question suivante consiste \u00e0 savoir si la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Air Canada appuie ses dires selon lesquels, apr\u00e8s novembre 2006, une contrainte excessive sera impos\u00e9e si la r\u00e8gle des 60 ans n\u2019existe plus.\n[413] \u00c0 mon sens, le c\u0153ur de l\u2019affaire d\u2019Air Canada a trait aux conclusions des exp\u00e9riences de M. Tarapasky et aux co\u00fbts qui en d\u00e9coulent, comme l\u2019a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le capitaine Duke. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de jeter un doute sur le r\u00e9sultat math\u00e9matique des exp\u00e9riences. Toutefois, les hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es par M. Tarapasky peuvent \u00eatre mises en doute.\n[414] Il ressort de la preuve que certaines combinaisons de capitaines et de copilotes susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions atteignent un seuil \u00e0 partir duquel le SPFP ne peut produire une solution en ce concerne le cr\u00e9neau horaire. Il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ici aux gros\u2011porteurs d\u2019Air Canada. M. Tarapasky a formul\u00e9 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle les pilotes sur ces vols seraient les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s des groupes de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[415] Le professeur Kesselman a contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de cette hypoth\u00e8se en soutenant que, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une retraite obligatoire, les copilotes ne seraient pas confin\u00e9s \u00e0 ce poste et qu\u2019ils seraient promus au rang de capitaine. En outre, \u00e0 son avis, les hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es par M. Tarapasky dans son mod\u00e8le, \u00e0 savoir que les copilotes resteraient des copilotes et qu\u2019une forte proportion d\u2019entre eux auraient plus de 60 ans, ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement valides, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e2ges diff\u00e9rents et que d\u2019autres facteurs ont eu une incidence sur leurs promotions.\n[416] Le professeur Kesselman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les pilotes qui sont en haut de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans chaque cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019emploi ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement ceux qui auront plus de 60 ans. L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 Air Canada. Les pilotes peuvent \u00eatre embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e2ges diff\u00e9rents et il pourrait y avoir des personnes qui ont cumul\u00e9 plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, mais qui sont moins \u00e2g\u00e9es et inversement. Selon le professeur, davantage de copilotes tendront \u00e0 \u00eatre plus jeunes et, \u00e0 la longue, sans la retraite obligatoire, il serait plus facile de respecter la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[417] Le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky exige des pourcentages beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de copilotes de plus de 60 ans, dans la plupart des cas, 30 %, 40 % ou m\u00eame 50 %, avant qu\u2019il n\u2019aboutisse \u00e0 cette impasse o\u00f9 il ne peut pas faire l\u2019appariement et ne peut respecter la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019OACI.\n[418] M. Salamat a soulign\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il y a une forte corr\u00e9lation entre l\u2019\u00e2ge et l\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Cependant, il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019en va pas toujours ainsi. Vous pouvez \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 et figurer en haut de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, et vous pouvez \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 et \u00eatre au centre ou en bas de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Vous ne pouvez pas \u00eatre jeune et avoir de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Un exemple serait celui du copilote George Vilven qui a pris sa retraite d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, soit au moment o\u00f9 il n\u2019avait que 22 ans de service et que son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1 404 le pla\u00e7ait au milieu de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[419] Le capitaine Duke a trouv\u00e9 une faiblesse dans le mod\u00e8le de M. Tarapasky. Il a affirm\u00e9 que les donn\u00e9es ne concernent qu\u2019un mois. Si les donn\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9es sur un an, il se pourrait que le SPFP produise une solution sur le B777 avec 80 % de capitaines et 30 % de copilotes. Je reconnais que cette preuve ne refl\u00e8te que les op\u00e9rations d\u2019un seul mois et ne peut \u00eatre repr\u00e9sentative de toute une ann\u00e9e ou d\u2019une p\u00e9riode future.\n[420] Enfin, la preuve de la r\u00e9partition par \u00e2ge et du niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en 2009 figure dans les rapports de M. Salamat et du capitaine Duke. Par exemple, ainsi qu\u2019il est expos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e un peu plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le tableau de M. Salamat, appel\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab soumissions de candidatures pour les appareils \u2013 \u00e2ge \u00e0 la fermeture des soumissions (janvier 2009) \u00bb, indique que l\u2019\u00e2ge des copilotes du B777, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, varie de 41,8 ans \u00e0 58,7 ans. Dans le cas des 76 pilotes occupant ce poste en 2009, l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen et l\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00e9dian \u00e9taient d\u2019environ 54 ans et 52 ans respectivement.\n[421] Le graphique du capitaine Duke (p. 60) r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, sur le nombre actuel de copilotes du B777, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, seulement 26 % d\u2019entre eux sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de 55 ans ou plus. Un autre de ses graphiques (p.10\/12) indique que le niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1 000 \u00e0 1 400, soit le milieu de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, pr\u00e9sente la plus forte concentration de copilotes du B777, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Toronto. De loin, seul un tr\u00e8s petit nombre de copilotes \u00e0 bord de cet appareil atteint le niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Le niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1 600 \u00e0 1 800 pr\u00e9sente la plus forte concentration de copilotes du A330, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Toronto.\n[422] Les conclusions de M. Tarapasky peuvent \u00eatre valides en soi. Toutefois, l\u2019aper\u00e7u ne vise qu\u2019un mois et repose sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle les copilotes de gros-porteurs sont les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s et que, pour chaque combinaison de pourcentages de CA et de copilotes, ceux-ci sont tous susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de restrictions, autrement dit ils sont tous \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans.\n[423] La preuve d\u00e9mographique est \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire. Les copilotes ne sont pas les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s ni les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s sur les gros-porteurs. Ce pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement la situation, mais il ne s\u2019agit que de simples conjectures.\n[424] La preuve du capitaine Duke concernant les r\u00e9percussions sur les co\u00fbts repose sur les conclusions de M. Tarapasky selon lesquelles le SPFP ne pourrait pas produire une solution pour les cr\u00e9neaux horaires r\u00e9els si la r\u00e8gle relative \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire est abolie. Dans cette mesure, ses conclusions ayant trait au co\u00fbt suppl\u00e9mentaire que doit assumer Air Canada doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\n[425] Au bout du compte, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019Air Canada ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de prouver qu\u2019elle subira une contrainte excessive avec l\u2019abolition de la r\u00e8gle de la retraite \u00e0 60 ans. En cons\u00e9quence, elle ne peut invoquer un moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur les EPJ en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP.\nII. Conclusion finale [426] J\u2019ai conclu que les intim\u00e9es peuvent s\u2019appuyer sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, duquel il ressort que la politique relative \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\n\u00ab Sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nJ.

Le 7 janvier 2011, Mme Palm a conclu une entente de r\u00e8glement amiable avec deux des cinq intim\u00e9s, la BCMEA (demande no 2008 1276) et Western (demande no 2008 1277). Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP, les r\u00e8glements amiables (collectivement, le r\u00e8glement) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission, qui les a approuv\u00e9s.\n[3] Le 14 juin 2011, les autres intim\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 la divulgation du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement, soutenant que le r\u00e8glement n\u2019est pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par privil\u00e8ge et que ses conditions sont pertinentes quant aux plaintes par lesquelles ils sont vis\u00e9s.\n[4] Mme Palm, qui n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, s\u2019oppose \u00e0 toute divulgation du r\u00e8glement.\n[5] Les employeurs intim\u00e9s acceptent qu\u2019il y ait divulgation des dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant sur la r\u00e9paration pour perte de salaire ou les d\u00e9penses, et sur le d\u00e9gagement de responsabilit\u00e9 de M. Wilkinson et M. Willicome. Ils soutiennent que cette divulgation devrait \u00eatre faite au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) seulement, et non aux autres intim\u00e9s. Les employeurs intim\u00e9s s\u2019opposent \u00e0 toute divulgation des dispositions du r\u00e8glement qui portent sur les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires et de toute disposition portant sur les mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques.\n[6] La Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation du r\u00e8glement, mais soutient subsidiairement que, si la divulgation est ordonn\u00e9e, elle devrait \u00eatre restreinte aux dispositions du r\u00e8glement pertinentes quant aux questions de la perte de salaire et des d\u00e9penses, ainsi qu\u2019au d\u00e9gagement de responsabilit\u00e9 de M. Wilkinson et de M. Willicome. La Commission soutient que la partie du r\u00e8glement quant aux dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires et aux mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques n\u2019est pas pertinente. Si la divulgation est ordonn\u00e9e, la Commission sugg\u00e8re que soit adopt\u00e9e la proc\u00e9dure \u00ab O\u2019Connor \u00bb, selon laquelle la divulgation est faite au Tribunal, qui d\u00e9termine ensuite quelles parties du r\u00e8glement, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, doivent \u00eatre produites aux autres intim\u00e9s.\n[7] Un examen attentif des cinq plaintes r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019elles sont fond\u00e9es sur une p\u00e9riode de deux mois de bouleversements dans les op\u00e9rations de Western au terminal Lynn Est du port de Vancouver. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une situation qui entra\u00eene des all\u00e9gations distinctes de comportement discriminatoire de la part d\u2019intim\u00e9s qui ne sont pas li\u00e9s. Plut\u00f4t, lorsqu\u2019on les examine ensemble, les plaintes dressent le portrait d\u2019un environnement de travail dans lequel existent des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents ancr\u00e9s d\u2019hostilit\u00e9 envers les femmes.\n[8] Bien que les plaintes ne soient pas identiques, elles comportent des ressemblances frappantes. Par exemple, chaque plainte comprend une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 un rapport de Vince Ready d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au syndicat le 21 janvier 2009 (le rapport Ready). Le syndicat a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Ready d\u2019examiner la discrimination au port et ce dernier s\u2019est fond\u00e9 principalement sur des entrevues confidentielles avec les membres du syndicat et sur leurs r\u00e9cits d\u2019exp\u00e9riences de travail au port. Les employeurs intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas particip\u00e9.\n[9] Il existe d\u2019autres similitudes, telles qu\u2019illustr\u00e9es, par exemple, dans les extraits suivants des plaintes contre Western et le syndicat :\n[traduction]\nWestern : \u00ab Western [\u2026] a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Mme Palm en raison de son sexe pendant son emploi au sein de Western, et en particulier pendant les mois de f\u00e9vrier et de mars 2008; Western a aussi omis d\u2019att\u00e9nuer de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit les actions discriminatoires et le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur le sexe impos\u00e9s par ses employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin envers Mme Palm pendant les mois de f\u00e9vrier et de mars 2008. \u00bb\nLe syndicat : \u00ab La section locale 500 de l\u2019ILWU [\u2026] a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Mme Palm et l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e en raison de son sexe pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de son appartenance \u00e0 la section locale 500, et en particulier pendant les mois de f\u00e9vrier et de mars 2008, au cours desquels elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e par Western Stevedoring Ltd [\u2026] et lors d\u2019une enqu\u00eate subs\u00e9quente sur le comportement discriminatoire qui eu lieu \u00e0 Western, enqu\u00eate effectu\u00e9e par la B.\u2011C. Maritime Employers Association [\u2026] La section locale 500 a aussi omis d\u2019att\u00e9nuer de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit les actions discriminatoires et le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur le sexe impos\u00e9s par ses membres de sexe masculin envers Mme Palm pendant les mois de f\u00e9vrier et de mars 2008. \u00bb\nL\u2019environnement de travail hostile de Western :\n\u00ab [\u2026] L\u2019environnement de travail \u00e0 Western est directement hostile envers les femmes et encourage une culture dans laquelle il est acceptable de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier et de sous\u2011estimer la pr\u00e9sence, le travail et la position des femmes \u00e0 titre de parties \u00e9gales de l\u2019effectif parce qu\u2019elles sont des femmes.\nUn rapport de janvier 2009 de Vince Ready sur la discrimination envers les femmes dans l\u2019environnement de travail des d\u00e9bardeurs de Vancouver fustige toutes les parties, y compris Western, impliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019emploi au port parce qu\u2019elles font preuve de discrimination envers les femmes et cr\u00e9ent une culture hostile envers elles. Les questions pr\u00e9cises qui contribuent \u00e0 un environnement qui fait syst\u00e9matiquement preuve de discrimination envers les femmes comprennent : [\u2026] \u00bb (La plainte \u00e9num\u00e8re 11 questions du rapport Ready.)\nL\u2019environnement de travail hostile du syndicat :\n\u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019environnement \u00e0 la section locale 500 est directement hostile envers les femmes et encourage une culture dans laquelle il est acceptable de d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier et de sous\u2011estimer la pr\u00e9sence, le travail et la position des femmes \u00e0 titre de parties \u00e9gales de l\u2019effectif, et \u00e0 titre de membres du syndicat, parce qu\u2019elles sont des femmes.\nUn rapport de janvier 2009 de Vince Ready sur la discrimination envers les femmes dans l\u2019environnement de travail des d\u00e9bardeurs de Vancouver fustige toutes les parties, y compris Western, impliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019emploi au port parce qu\u2019elles font preuve de discrimination envers les femmes et cr\u00e9ent une culture hostile envers elles. Les questions pr\u00e9cises qui contribuent \u00e0 un environnement qui fait syst\u00e9matiquement preuve de discrimination envers les femmes comprennent : [\u2026] \u00bb (La plainte \u00e9num\u00e8re ensuite 10 questions du rapport Ready, qui sont presque identiques \u00e0 celles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la plainte contre Western.)\n[10] Le 15 juin 2009, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutive du syndicat a adopt\u00e9 le rapport Ready et ses recommandations, dont deux sont pertinentes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab [\u2026] que le syndicat et l\u2019employeur d\u00e9veloppent une proc\u00e9dure de grief adapt\u00e9e afin de traiter les griefs, qui comprennent des all\u00e9gations de manquement \u00e0 la Loi sur les droits de la personne; \u00bb\n\u00ab [\u2026] que le syndicat tente de modifier la convention collective afin de refl\u00e9ter sa position quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination du harc\u00e8lement et de la discrimination. \u00bb\nIl convient de noter que M. Ready a fait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der ses recommandations de la remarque suivante :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Avant de me lancer dans mes recommandations, je sens aussi le besoin de noter que l\u2019approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re actuelle du port de Vancouver doit faire partie d\u2019un processus conjoint avec l\u2019employeur. Je fais cette observation sans tenir compte du fait que c\u2019est l\u2019employeur qui a l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de fournir un environnement de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination. \u00bb\n[11] La requ\u00eate en divulgation des autres intim\u00e9s \u00e9tablit le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits suivants :\nLes plaintes de Mme Palm envers les employeurs intim\u00e9s et les autres intim\u00e9s ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 6 mars 2009 et sont en grande partie identiques. La BCMEA poss\u00e8de et op\u00e8re le centre de placement de Vancouver, par lequel les membres du syndicat et les employ\u00e9s temporaires qui souhaitent devenir membres du syndicat obtiennent du travail. La majorit\u00e9 des emplois sont combl\u00e9s par un placement quotidien, mais, en vertu de la convention collective, une compagnie peut demander un travailleur de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Le travailleur rel\u00e8ve alors directement de cette compagnie pendant un an. Pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, Mme Palm, M. Wellicome et M. Wilkinson \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 Western Stevedoring, une compagnie membre de la BCMEA. Mme Palm et son partenaire M. Russo \u00e9taient les deux pousseurs d\u2019acier. M. Wellicome et M. Wilkinson et dix autres personnes \u00e9taient des pousseurs de p\u00e2te. Le quart de travail des pousseurs d\u2019acier commen\u00e7ait une heure plus t\u00f4t que les heures de travail r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, donc les pousseurs d\u2019acier recevaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une heure de paie en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires chaque jour de la semaine. L\u2019attribution des heures suppl\u00e9mentaire lors de la fin de semaine \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le nombre d\u2019heures que l\u2019employ\u00e9 avait travaill\u00e9es durant la semaine \u2013 l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui avait le moins d\u2019heures de travail pendant la semaine \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re personne \u00e0 se voir attribuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires de fin de semaine. Vers f\u00e9vrier 2008, une controverse entre les pousseurs d\u2019acier et les pousseurs de p\u00e2te a vu le jour au sujet de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il s\u2019agissait du r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une diminution du travail au port en raison du ralentissement de l\u2019\u00e9conomie. Les pousseurs d\u2019acier ont cess\u00e9 de commencer t\u00f4t aussi souvent et se sont donc retrouv\u00e9s plus haut sur la liste pour le travail de fin de semaine. Comme moins de travail de fin de semaine \u00e9tait disponible, certains pousseurs de p\u00e2te n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler alors que Mme Palm et M. Russo ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s. Lors de plusieurs r\u00e9unions des employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers, il y a eu des discussions anim\u00e9es au sujet du syst\u00e8me d\u2019attribution des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. La plainte de Mme Palm porte sur cette p\u00e9riode. Le 28 mai 2008, Mme Palm a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019administrateur de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Western Stevedoring dans laquelle elle soutenait \u00eatre victime de harc\u00e8lement de la part de ses coll\u00e8gues. Il n\u2019y avait aucune all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe ou d\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait li\u00e9 au sexe. Western Stevedoring a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate au sujet de la plainte de Mme Palm. Le 2 septembre 2008, la BCMEA a fourni au syndicat un rapport final sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate quant \u00e0 la plainte de harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019enqu\u00eate a conclu que M. Wilkinson avait mal inscrit les heures de travail de Mme Palm; que M. Wellicome avait dit \u00e0 Mme Palm d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab aller se faire foutre \u00bb; que certains pousseurs de p\u00e2te employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers exer\u00e7aient consid\u00e9rablement de pression sur Mme Palm et sur tout autre employ\u00e9 qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de leur avis, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait [traduction] \u00ab aucune preuve ou all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ce comportement \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019un des motifs de distinction illicites. \u00bb Western Stevedoring a \u00e9crit une lettre de r\u00e9primande \u00e0 M. Wellicome pour son comportement envers Mme Palm.\n[12] Les autres intim\u00e9s soutiennent que, comme il y a un caract\u00e8re commun aux circonstances dans les cinq plaintes de Mme Palm, les dispositions du r\u00e8glement avec les employeurs intim\u00e9s sont pertinentes quant aux plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es contre eux et ne devraient pas \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par privil\u00e8ge. Les autres intim\u00e9s citent \u00e0 ce sujet les d\u00e9cisions Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 5 et Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. c. Barbe, 2003 TCDP 15.\n[13] La Commission soutient que le r\u00e8glement est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par privil\u00e8ge et que la divulgation ne peut pas \u00eatre impos\u00e9e, citant entre autres le paragraphe 47(3) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision dans Barbe, je suis convaincu que le paragraphe 47(3) de la LCDP n\u2019interdit pas la divulgation du r\u00e8glement comme tel.\n[14] Les employeurs intim\u00e9s soutiennent que deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique expriment de fa\u00e7on plus appropri\u00e9e les r\u00e8gles quant \u00e0 la protection par privil\u00e8ge d\u2019un r\u00e8glement et soutiennent que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tablie dans British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital c. Air Products Canada Ltd, 2003 B.J.C. No 591 (CA) (British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital) et dans la d\u00e9cision Dos Santos (Committee of) c. Sun Life Assurance of Canada, 2005 BCCA 4 (Dos Santos), est que les ententes de r\u00e8glement sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par privil\u00e8ge et ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es sauf si elles sont tant pertinentes que n\u00e9cessaires dans les circonstances du dossier afin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat souverain de la justice.\n[15] Dans la d\u00e9cision Dos Santos, on affirme qu\u2019il peut y exister des exceptions au privil\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9ral quant \u00e0 la divulgation de r\u00e8glements et on y \u00e9tablit le crit\u00e8re pour une telle exception :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Cependant, le crit\u00e8re pour s\u2019acquitter du fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une exception ne devrait pas \u00eatre trop faible. La politique publique justifiant la protection par privil\u00e8ge d\u2019un r\u00e8glement est imp\u00e9rieuse. Elle est si imp\u00e9rieuse que m\u00eame des menaces dans le contexte de n\u00e9gociations de r\u00e8glement ne peuvent pas justifier une exception : Unilever, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux pages 2449\u20112450.\nPour \u00e9tablir une exception en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat public divergent prime sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public envers le r\u00e8glement. Il ne devrait y avoir exception que lorsque les documents demand\u00e9s sont tant pertinents que n\u00e9cessaires dans les circonstances du dossier afin d\u2019arriver soit \u00e0 une entente de la part des parties au r\u00e8glement, soit \u00e0 un autre int\u00e9r\u00eat imp\u00e9rieux et souverain quant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice. \u00bb [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Dos Santos, le juge en chef Finch a ensuite conclu que la seule fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9tablir objectivement ce qu\u2019un plaignant avait r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u comme indemnisation pour perte de salaire \u00e9tait de reconna\u00eetre une exception pour les documents de r\u00e8glement qui, autrement, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par privil\u00e8ge :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Tant la pertinence que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des documents militent donc en faveur d\u2019une exception.\nJ\u2019ai aussi examin\u00e9 si le fait de reconna\u00eetre une exception en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce refroidirait les n\u00e9gociations pour le r\u00e8glement. Je ne crois pas que c\u2019est le cas. Comme dans d\u2019autres cas o\u00f9 des r\u00e8glements peuvent avoir un effet direct sur les droits et les responsabilit\u00e9s de tierces parties, les parties \u00e0 ce r\u00e8glement doivent tenir compte du fait que la nature confidentielle de leur entente ne sera pas respect\u00e9e tant qu\u2019elle affecte ces autres parties. [\u2026]\nLe juge en chambre n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que le r\u00e8glement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par privil\u00e8ge quant aux documents demand\u00e9s. Une exception au privil\u00e8ge existe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00bb\nD\u00c9CISION\n[17] Je conclus que les autres intim\u00e9s ont satisfait au crit\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision Dos Santos. Compte tenu des similitudes et de l\u2019interd\u00e9pendance frappantes des plaintes de Mme Palm, je conclus que les dispositions du r\u00e8glement sont pertinentes quant aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre les autres intim\u00e9s et sont n\u00e9cessaires afin de permettre aux autres intim\u00e9s de pr\u00e9parer correctement leurs r\u00e9ponses aux all\u00e9gations de Mme Palm et pour permettre au Tribunal de rendre une d\u00e9cision juste au sujet des plaintes, si l\u2019on en arrivait \u00e0 une audience. Les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant sur le d\u00e9gagement de responsabilit\u00e9 peuvent affecter directement le r\u00e9sultats des plaintes de Mme Palm contre M. Wilkinson et M. Willicome. Je conclus que les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant tant sur la perte de salaire que sur les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires sont pertinentes et n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019il y ait double r\u00e9paration en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question et pour permettre une certaine forme de proportionnalit\u00e9 dans les plaintes interd\u00e9pendantes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question.\n[18] En fonction des documents dont je suis saisi, en particulier les portions extraites du rapport Ready, il est clair que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique envers les femmes au port est un probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux et de longue date. De plus, comme M. Ready le note dans son rapport, toute solution au probl\u00e8me doit impliquer tant l\u2019employeur que le syndicat. Toutes les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant sur la plainte de Mme Palm en mati\u00e8re de discrimination syst\u00e9mique sont tant pertinentes que n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019atteindre un r\u00e9sultat juste vu les circonstances.\n[19] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public envers le r\u00e8glement juste et judicieux de ces plaintes l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public divergent visant \u00e0 encourager le r\u00e8glement par une confidentialit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nORDONNANCE\n[20] J\u2019ordonne la divulgation du r\u00e8glement aux autres intim\u00e9s, divulgation qui doit \u00eatre faite de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\na) Dans les quatorze jours apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, Harris & Company, le cabinet d\u2019avocats des employeurs intim\u00e9s, fournira une copie du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 Caroline & Gislason, le cabinet d\u2019avocats des autres intim\u00e9s;\nb) Ni Caroline & Gislason ni les autres intim\u00e9s n\u2019utiliseront la copie du r\u00e8glement pour un tout autre objectif que la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019audience ou le r\u00e8glement des plaintes de Mme Palm contre les autres intim\u00e9s;\nc) Caroline & Gislason pourra communiquer les dispositions du r\u00e8glement de fa\u00e7on orale aux autres intim\u00e9s.

Sommaire [1] Sant\u00e9 Canada (SC) soumet \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (ACDI) qui souhaitent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. SC a \u00e9tabli des directives \u2013 Les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u2013 qui s\u2019appliquent express\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale des employ\u00e9s d\u00e9sireux d\u2019obtenir une affectation en Afghanistan. Ces directives, sous la rubrique \u00ab Exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb, pr\u00e9cisent que les employ\u00e9s qui souffrent d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019entra\u00eener une urgence m\u00e9dicale et de mettre leur vie en p\u00e9ril si l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux m\u00e9dicaments ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres traitements prescrits \u00e9tait interrompu pendant une courte p\u00e9riode ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux exigences m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 leur affectation. Dans ce contexte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que son employeur, l\u2019ACDI, a commis un acte discriminatoire en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan parce qu\u2019elle souffrait du diab\u00e8te de type 1. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que SC a commis un acte discriminatoire en recommandant \u00e0 son employeur, l\u2019ACDI, de ne pas l\u2019affecter en Afghanistan \u00e0 cause de son diab\u00e8te. Elle all\u00e8gue en outre que son employeur n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont il disposait pour d\u00e9cider de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la recommandation de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[2] Les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ne refl\u00e8tent pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dont jouissent tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. M\u00eame si elles sont con\u00e7ues pour \u00eatre instructives et informatives, leur libell\u00e9 donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019exigences m\u00e9dicales imp\u00e9ratives, sans \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de chaque personne. Le processus par lequel SC, influenc\u00e9 comme il l\u2019\u00e9tait par les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la plaignante et est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 sa recommandation n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la valeur et de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de celle-ci. \u00c0 cause de l\u2019application de ces directives, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination lors de son \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. SC n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re suffisante que sa conduite n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Il s\u2019ensuit que la plaignante, du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement en raison du libell\u00e9 des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan et de la mani\u00e8re dont SC les a appliqu\u00e9es.\n[3] Il ressort de la preuve que la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan serait une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019ACDI. Les Canadiens qui travaillent dans ce pays sont expos\u00e9s \u00e0 des risques s\u00e9rieux sur le plan de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et ces risques se concr\u00e9tisent souvent. Ce n\u2019est pas uniquement la plaignante qui supporte ces risques, mais aussi les membres des Forces canadiennes et les autres militaires \u00e9trangers. Selon la preuve produite, les recommandations du troisi\u00e8me endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant qui a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la plaignante en vue de la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en sa faveur en Afghanistan ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es en tout temps et risquaient de faire courir un danger \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI. Les installations et les services m\u00e9dicaux sont restreints, et cela inclut l\u2019espace-lits; les lits doivent donc \u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour le traitement des troupes et des civils afghans bless\u00e9s de m\u00eame que pour les situations d\u2019urgence impr\u00e9visibles qui touchent tous les civils affect\u00e9s en Afghanistan. Dans les exigences \u00e0 remplir pour accomplir la mission en Afghanistan, il est justifi\u00e9 de soumettre les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un processus de s\u00e9lection et d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale avant leur d\u00e9ploiement et le crit\u00e8re strict que l\u2019on applique pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est justifiable mais il faudrait qu\u2019il soit appliqu\u00e9 en accord avec les principes li\u00e9s aux droits de la personne et au cas par cas, suivant une d\u00e9marche individualis\u00e9e. Par ailleurs, l\u2019ACDI a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d\u2019envisager pour la plaignante toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables. Elle \u00e9tait tenue d\u2019obtenir toutes les informations pertinentes sur la d\u00e9ficience de son employ\u00e9e et d\u2019examiner s\u00e9rieusement quelles mesures d\u2019accommodement elle pouvait prendre en sa faveur. Elle n\u2019a pas produit assez de preuves montrant qu\u2019elle avait envisag\u00e9 toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables.\n[4] En cons\u00e9quence, les deux plaintes sont justifi\u00e9es au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de SC et au regard des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019ACDI; de plus, le Tribunal ordonne que l\u2019on prenne des mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es pour \u00e9liminer ces pratiques discriminatoires.\nII. Le contexte et les plaintes [5] C\u2019est la guerre en Afghanistan. Les combats sont constants, complexes et dangereux. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont eu lieu, le Canada faisait partie des 41 pays participant \u00e0 la Force internationale d\u2019assistance \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (FIAS), une formation dirig\u00e9e par l\u2019Organisation du Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Atlantique Nord (OTAN) qui m\u00e8ne ses op\u00e9rations en Afghanistan sous l\u2019\u00e9gide de l\u2019Organisation des Nations Unies (ONU)[1]. L\u2019ONU dirige \u00e9galement la Mission d\u2019assistance des Nations Unies en Afghanistan (MANUA), une mission politique cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du gouvernement afghan afin d\u2019aider ce dernier et la population afghane \u00e0 jeter les fondements d\u2019une paix et d\u2019un d\u00e9veloppement durables[2]. Dans le cadre la MANUA, la Division des affaires politiques soutient les mesures qui sont prises sur le plan de la sensibilisation politique, du r\u00e8glement du conflit, du d\u00e9sarmement et de la collaboration r\u00e9gionale. Le mandat politique de la MANUA \u00e9taye la mise en \u0153uvre des objectifs institutionnels et politiques de l\u2019Accord de Bonn, sign\u00e9 en novembre 2001, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un \u00e9ventail d\u2019activit\u00e9s de consolidation de la paix[3].\n[6] Le Canada maintient une pr\u00e9sence en Afghanistan depuis 2001. Le pays a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9chelons aux efforts faits en Afghanistan en faveur du maintien de la paix, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de la reconstruction. La situation dans ce pays requiert une solide coop\u00e9ration internationale, et cette coop\u00e9ration est assur\u00e9e par du personnel tant militaire que civil car les efforts de reconstruction sont souvent supervis\u00e9s par des organisations \u00e0 la fois militaires et civiles. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans les plaintes ont eu lieu, tous les civils canadiens servant \u00e0 Kandahar accomplissaient leurs t\u00e2ches sous la direction du repr\u00e9sentant du Canada \u00e0 Kandahar (RCK), qui rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019ambassadeur du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul[4]. Au Canada, l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (ACDI) est la principale organisation charg\u00e9e de fournir une aide aux pays en d\u00e9veloppement; elle a pour mandat de g\u00e9rer les mesures de soutien, les mesures d\u2019aide et les ressources que le Canada destine aux pays en d\u00e9veloppement tels que l\u2019Afghanistan.\n[7] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une partie du contexte dans lequel sont survenus les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La plaignante, Mme Bronwyn Cruden, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 8 novembre 2008. Premi\u00e8rement, elle all\u00e8gue que son employeur \u2013 l\u2019ACDI \u2013 a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la LCDP) en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan parce qu\u2019elle souffrait du diab\u00e8te de type 1. Selon la seconde plainte, Sant\u00e9 Canada (SC) a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP en recommandant \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan \u00e0 cause de son diab\u00e8te. La plainte contre SC a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, avec le consentement des parties, en vue d\u2019inclure les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Le 18 mars 2010, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal, ou le TCDP) instruise les deux plaintes. Celles-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes car elles mettent essentiellement en cause les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit. La Commission a pris part \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire, qui s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e du 26 janvier au 4 f\u00e9vrier 2011, et elle repr\u00e9sentait l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019instance.\nIII. Les faits [8] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les parties ont fournis, y compris l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, mes conclusions de fait sont les suivantes :\nLa plaignante est une employ\u00e9e de l\u2019ACDI qui travaille \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle \u00e0 Gatineau, \u00e0 l\u2019administration centrale de cette agence. Entre le 6 ao\u00fbt et le 7 septembre 2007 environ, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 titre temporaire \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul (Afghanistan). Avant son d\u00e9part, elle n\u2019a pas subi d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 un d\u00e9ploiement car, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, la politique de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019exigeait pas que les employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode de moins d\u2019un an subissent une telle \u00e9valuation.\n[9] En janvier 2008, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un certain nombre d\u2019affectations d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019un an en Afghanistan que l\u2019ACDI allait offrir sous peu. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste de \u00ab directeur(trice) de Kandahar \u00bb ainsi que pour d\u2019autres postes d\u2019agent de d\u00e9veloppement.\n[10] Le 20 janvier 2008, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9e une deuxi\u00e8me fois en Afghanistan, cette fois-ci \u00e0 Kandahar, dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00c9quipe provinciale de reconstruction (EPR). Cette affectation devait durer jusqu\u2019au 25 f\u00e9vrier 2008.\n[11] Le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2008, t\u00f4t le matin, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un \u00ab incident \u00bb hypoglyc\u00e9mique durant son sommeil. Une coll\u00e8gue de travail, pr\u00e9sente dans la pi\u00e8ce adjacente, l\u2019a entendue faire des bruits et des mouvements dans son sommeil; elle a essay\u00e9 de la r\u00e9veiller et, voyant qu\u2019elle n\u2019y parvenait pas, elle a appel\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin militaire des Forces canadiennes, qui a administr\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante du glucose par voie intraveineuse. La plaignante a par la suite obtenu son cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soign\u00e9e. Plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, on l\u2019a orient\u00e9e vers un consultant en m\u00e9decine interne post\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9rodrome de Kandahar (KAF), qui a fortement recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit rapatri\u00e9e au Canada. Cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la recommandation du consultant en m\u00e9decine interne et a souhait\u00e9 rester en Afghanistan pour terminer son affectation temporaire. L\u2019ACDI a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre un terme \u00e0 l\u2019affectation et a renvoy\u00e9 sans d\u00e9lai la plaignante au Canada.\n[12] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2008, Michael Collins (directeur, Services de gestion, ACDI) a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 certains de ses coll\u00e8gues membres du Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan (GTA) afin de savoir s\u2019ils \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir des affectations de campagne en Afghanistan. Tous ceux qui ont re\u00e7u ce courriel ont depuis lors \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s en Afghanistan, sauf la plaignante.\n[13] \u00c0 son retour au Canada, la plaignante a obtenu une lettre de soutien de la part de l\u2019endocrinologue qui la traitait, la Dre Amel Arnaout. La lettre, dat\u00e9e du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2008, appuie les efforts faits par la plaignante pour retourner travailler en Afghanistan. La Dre Arnaout explique que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2008 et qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab est mentalement et physiquement apte \u00e0 poursuivre son travail en Afghanistan [\u2026] \u00bb. Par un courriel dat\u00e9 du 22 f\u00e9vrier 2008, Marion Parry (gestionnaire, Programmes de mobilit\u00e9 et d\u00e9veloppement de carri\u00e8re, ACDI) a demand\u00e9 que la plaignante subisse une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale afin de v\u00e9rifier si elle pouvait poursuivre son affectation temporaire et de d\u00e9terminer son aptitude \u00e0 recevoir une affectation vu le souhait qu\u2019elle avait exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une affectation officielle d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019un an.\n[14] Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 26 f\u00e9vrier 2008 et adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, le Major Robin Thurlow (Commandement de la Force exp\u00e9ditionnaire du Canada, SSSI) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait du fait que les personnes que l\u2019on d\u00e9ployait en Afghanistan pour une p\u00e9riode de moins d\u2019un an ne subissaient aucun examen m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9alable. Il a ensuite demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on veille \u00e0 ce que toutes les personnes envoy\u00e9es en Afghanistan soient soumises \u00e0 un tel examen. L\u2019ACDI a par la suite chang\u00e9 ses m\u00e9thodes pour exiger que tous les employ\u00e9s envoy\u00e9s en Afghanistan pour une dur\u00e9e quelconque subissent, avant leur d\u00e9ploiement, un contr\u00f4le m\u00e9dical.\n[15] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Directive sur le service ext\u00e9rieur no 9 \u2013 Examens m\u00e9dicaux et dentaires (DSE9) (voir la DSE9, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1) que publie le Conseil national mixte, SC soumet \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI qui souhaitent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. La DSE9 indique aussi comment ces \u00e9valuations doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es. Tant SC que l\u2019ACDI sont tenus de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la DSE9. Pour proc\u00e9der aux \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales, SC a \u00e9tabli et publie le Guide de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la sant\u00e9 au travail (GEST), qui a pour but d\u2019aider \u00e0 guider les m\u00e9decins examinateurs qui proc\u00e8dent aux \u00e9valuations (voir la section 1 du GEST, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 2). Peu apr\u00e8s que le Major Thurlow a envoy\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2008 son courriel indiquant que toutes les personnes affect\u00e9es en Afghanistan devaient subir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale, SC a \u00e9tabli les \u00ab Directives concernant les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales en vue d\u2019une autorisation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 une affectation, \u00e0 un service temporaire ou \u00e0 un voyage en Afghanistan dans des endroits dangereux de niveau 5 avec indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9 \u00bb (les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan) (voir les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 3). Sous la rubrique intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan prescrivent ceci :\nL\u2019employ\u00e9 ne r\u00e9pond pas aux exigences m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 l\u2019affectation ou au service : [\u2026] s\u2019il souffre d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui pourrait entra\u00eener une urgence m\u00e9dicale et mettre en p\u00e9ril sa vie si l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux m\u00e9dicaments ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres traitements prescrits \u00e9tait interrompu pendant une courte p\u00e9riode.\n[16] Le 18 mars 2008, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 la Dre Maureen Peggy Baxter (m\u00e9decin en sant\u00e9 du travail, ou MST) \u00e0 la clinique de sant\u00e9 (la clinique) du Programme de sant\u00e9 au travail et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public (PSTSP) de SC afin que l\u2019on d\u00e9termine si elle \u00e9tait une candidate appropri\u00e9e pour un poste en Afghanistan. La plaignante a remis \u00e0 la Dre Baxter ses dossiers de sant\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs ainsi qu\u2019une copie de la lettre de la Dre Arnaout dat\u00e9e du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2008. \u00c0 la suite de cette \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale, le 9 avril 2008, la Dre Baxter a consult\u00e9 certains de ses coll\u00e8gues MST \u00e0 la clinique. Tous ont convenu de recommander que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Kaboul. La Dre Eva Callay et la Dr Lloyd-Jones ont pris part \u00e0 la discussion et, avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision, n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 l\u2019avis d\u2019un tiers ind\u00e9pendant, ainsi que le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9.05a) de la DSE9. Le m\u00eame jour, la Dre Baxter a indiqu\u00e9 dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Cl\u00e9ment B\u00e9dard (adjoint aux programmes, Centre de gestion des affectations, ACDI) qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e9tait chronique et qu\u2019il y avait un risque de d\u00e9stabilisation, il \u00e9tait impossible de recommander qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9ploy\u00e9e en Afghanistan car elle avait besoin de soins et de traitements sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles au lieu d\u2019affectation en question. La Dre Baxter a toutefois signal\u00e9 que la Dre Arnaout avait fourni des informations indiquant que l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 actuel de la plaignante \u00e9tait stable. La lettre de la Dre Baxter n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, pas plus que SC ne l\u2019a avis\u00e9e de la recommandation qu\u2019il avait faite \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI.\n[17] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la recommandation de SC, l\u2019ACDI a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas envoyer la plaignante en Afghanistan et n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019autres recherches aupr\u00e8s de la Dre Baxter ou de la Dre Arnaout ou, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9.05b) de la DSE9, cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un troisi\u00e8me avis m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant.\n[18] Le 10 avril 2008, la plaignante a re\u00e7u de Mme Parry une lettre l\u2019informant que sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le poste de \u00ab directeur(trice) de Kandahar \u00bb. Mme Parry n\u2019a pas fait part \u00e0 la plaignante du r\u00e9sultat des autres demandes concernant les postes d\u2019agent de d\u00e9veloppement pour lesquels elle avait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature.\n[19] Vers le 15 ou le 16 avril 2008, la plaignante a eu une conversation avec Michael Collins, qui lui a dit que SC avait fait une recommandation d\u00e9favorable quant au fait de la renvoyer ou de l\u2019affecter en Afghanistan.\n[20] La plaignante a voulu obtenir des informations aupr\u00e8s de SC. La Dre Baxter et elle ont \u00e9chang\u00e9 des courriels et se sont parl\u00e9es au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Le 17 avril 2008, la plaignante a appris de la Dre Baxter que c\u2019\u00e9tait SC qui avait pour responsabilit\u00e9 de formuler des recommandations en fonction des \u00e9valuations de sant\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, mais que toutes les d\u00e9cisions concernant le d\u00e9ploiement des employ\u00e9s relevaient de l\u2019ACDI. La plaignante a transmis le courriel de la Dre Baxter \u00e0 Michael Collins (directeur, Services de gestion, ACDI) et a demand\u00e9 si l\u2019ACDI pouvait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 retourner en Afghanistan. Personne \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ce courriel. Le 21 avril 2008, elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Dre Baxter pour demander si SC pouvait fournir une liste de pays pour lesquels il ne recommanderait pas de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une affectation. Le 23 avril 2008, la Dre Baxter a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019une telle liste n\u2019existait pas et que, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les niveaux de contrainte sup\u00e9rieurs ont moins de chances de disposer de services m\u00e9dicaux appropri\u00e9s; elle a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de dresser une liste restreinte de certains des pays qui l\u2019int\u00e9ressaient et de demander \u00e0 son minist\u00e8re d\u2019envoyer une demande d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[21] Le 2 juin 2008, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Danica Shimbashi (directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Ressources humaines, ACDI) et lui a pos\u00e9 des questions pour savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 que l\u2019ACDI ne suive pas une recommandation de SC. Elle a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 si l\u2019ACDI demanderait pour ses affectations que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9alable de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[22] Le 20 juin 2008, Mme Parry, qui avait re\u00e7u la demande que Mme Shimbashi lui avait transmise, a r\u00e9pondu directement \u00e0 la plaignante et l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que SC \u00e9tait le seul organisme de sant\u00e9 au travail qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 des \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales. Mme Parry a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait aviser la direction d\u2019\u00eatre guid\u00e9e en tout temps par la d\u00e9cision de SC, car les gestionnaires et le personnel des ressources humaines de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en mesure de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer un avis m\u00e9dical. De plus, l\u2019ACDI a inform\u00e9 la plaignante que les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales de SC n\u2019\u00e9taient valables que pour six mois, parce qu\u2019elles ne s\u2019appliquaient qu\u2019\u00e0 une mission particuli\u00e8re et que l\u2019ACDI ne pouvait pas les autoriser \u00e0 l\u2019avance. Mme Parry a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de relancer la Dre Baxter afin de d\u00e9terminer quels niveaux de contrainte pourraient raisonnablement disposer des capacit\u00e9s m\u00e9dicales voulues pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 son probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9.\n[23] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2008, M. Wallace, de l\u2019ACDI, a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante pour dire que SC \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 passer en revue les pays dans lesquels une personne dans son \u00e9tat pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elle pouvait communiquer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard avec la Dre Eva Callary (m\u00e9decin-chef, Clinique de sant\u00e9 au travail, PSTSP, SC).\n[24] Le 25 septembre 2008, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 la Dre Eva Callary, qui lui a remis une liste de 19 pays auxquels on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que des personnes soient affect\u00e9es pour 2009. Lors de cette rencontre, la Dre Callary a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de demander une r\u00e9vision interne de sa situation au Comit\u00e9 consultatif m\u00e9dical de SC (CCM-SC). C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que la plaignante \u00e9tait mise au courant d\u2019une telle possibilit\u00e9.\n[25] Le 3 octobre 2008, la Dre Callary, par courriel, a assur\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante que SC respecterait la d\u00e9cision du CCM-SC, quelle qu\u2019elle soit.\n[26] Le 28 novembre 2008, la Dre Baxter a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la plaignante au sujet de la liste de 19 pays que la Dre Callary avait fournie plus t\u00f4t. SC a conclu que cinq de ces pays \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme appropri\u00e9s, cinq comme non appropri\u00e9s et trois comme des [traduction] \u00ab missions pr\u00e9occupantes \u00bb, qui obligeraient \u00e0 subir une \u00e9valuation individuelle. Pour les six autres missions, la Dre Baxter a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les informations re\u00e7ues des m\u00e9decins r\u00e9gionaux responsables \u00e9taient insuffisantes et qu\u2019un addenda suivrait apr\u00e8s que l\u2019on aurait re\u00e7u de plus amples renseignements. Aucun addenda n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni.\n[27] Le m\u00eame jour, la Dre Arnaout a \u00e9crit une lettre d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour la plaignante et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait que le diab\u00e8te dont souffrait cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re optimale et qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait que la lettre lui serait utile dans son processus d\u2019appel relatif aux affectations en Afghanistan. La plaignante a demand\u00e9 par \u00e9crit au CCM-SC que l\u2019on r\u00e9vise sa situation m\u00e9dicale.\n[28] Le 16 janvier 2009, le CCM-SC a produit sa recommandation et a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la Dre Baxter \u00e0 cet effet. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de subir un examen m\u00e9dical aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant, y compris une revue de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, son \u00e9tat clinique et des rapports d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur les conditions m\u00e9dicales en Afghanistan. Le CCM-SC a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si l\u2019endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant exprimait l\u2019avis qu\u2019une affectation en Afghanistan ne poserait pas de risques pour la plaignante ou d\u2019autres personnes, il consid\u00e9rerait que son cas r\u00e9pondrait aux exigences m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 cette affectation. Par contre, s\u2019il exprimait l\u2019avis que l\u2019affectation \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement d\u00e9conseill\u00e9e, la recommandation initiale serait maintenue. La Dre Baxter a envoy\u00e9 une copie de la d\u00e9cision du CCM-SC \u00e0 la plaignante le 30 janvier 2009.\n[29] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2009, la plaignante a inform\u00e9 SC qu\u2019elle serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 subir l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical vers le milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2009.\n[30] Le 22 septembre 2009, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par le Dr Hugues Beauregard, un endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant exer\u00e7ant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et choisi par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 externe (Compremed Canada Inc.). La Dre Joanne Lloyd-Jones (MST, SC) avait envoy\u00e9 au Dr Beauregard l\u2019historique de la plaignante, d\u00e9crit les installations m\u00e9dicales disponibles en Afghanistan et indiqu\u00e9 les questions auxquelles SC voulait que ce m\u00e9decin r\u00e9ponde. Dans son rapport pr\u00e9liminaire, dat\u00e9 du 23 septembre 2009, le Dr Beauregard a dit consid\u00e9rer que la plaignante \u00e9tait capable de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 des conditions de travail difficiles et que, compte tenu de ses connaissances sur la mani\u00e8re de g\u00e9rer son diab\u00e8te, il fallait l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 accepter une affectation en Afghanistan. Dans son rapport dat\u00e9 du 29 septembre 2009, le Dr Beauregard a qualifi\u00e9 la plaignante de personne bien inform\u00e9e, organis\u00e9e et motiv\u00e9e. Selon ce m\u00e9decin, la plaignante \u00e9tait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 des risques de sant\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que dans le cas des non-diab\u00e9tiques, m\u00eame si elle g\u00e9rait efficacement son diab\u00e8te de type 1. Le Dr Beauregard a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9ploy\u00e9e en Afghanistan car il \u00e9tait possible de r\u00e9duire les risques pour la sant\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 un [traduction] \u00ab niveau acceptable \u00bb et que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle pouvait apporter le mat\u00e9riel dont elle avait besoin, elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler sans restrictions \u00e0 Kaboul, au KAF ou au sein de l\u2019EPR. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la suggestion du Dr Beauregard, la plaignante a subi une \u00e9preuve de stress cardiaque et une \u00e9valuation psychologique, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face au stress associ\u00e9 aux zones de conflit. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme psychologiquement apte pour un travail \u00e0 plein temps et une \u00e9ventuelle affectation en Afghanistan. La plaignante a remis des copies du rapport du Dr Beauregard \u00e0 divers fonctionnaires de l\u2019ACDI en octobre 2009, dont son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Dave Metcalfe, Amy Baker (directrice de cabinet de la pr\u00e9sidente, ACDI) et Joanne Marquis (Ressources humaines, ACDI).\n[31] Le 5 novembre 2009, SC a demand\u00e9 au Dr Beauregard de clarifier le contenu de son rapport m\u00e9dical en tenant compte des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan qui \u00e9taient en vigueur. La Dre Lloyd-Jones a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Cl\u00e9ment B\u00e9dard pour lui faire savoir qu\u2019elle avait obtenu des informations du Dr Beauregard, mais qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements.\n[32] Le 19 novembre 2009, le Dr Beauregard a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande d\u2019\u00e9claircissements de la Dre Lloyd-Jones. La plaignante, a-t-il \u00e9crit, serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inapte par l\u2019\u00ab exigence m\u00e9dicale absolue \u00bb de SC selon laquelle aucun employ\u00e9 ne doit [traduction] \u00ab [souffrir] d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui pourrait entra\u00eener une urgence m\u00e9dicale et mettre en p\u00e9ril sa vie si l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux m\u00e9dicaments ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres traitements prescrits \u00e9tait interrompu pendant une courte p\u00e9riode \u00bb (voir les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 3). Cependant, le Dr Beauregard a dit toujours croire que la plaignante pouvait quand m\u00eame \u00eatre d\u00e9ploy\u00e9e car elle \u00e9tait capable de g\u00e9rer son diab\u00e8te dans les conditions existantes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9duire tout risque \u00e0 des niveaux acceptables.\n[33] Le m\u00eame jour, la Dre Lloyd-Jones a \u00e9crit de nouveau \u00e0 M. B\u00e9dard. Dans sa lettre, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Dr Beauregard avait conclu qu\u2019il fallait autoriser la plaignante \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Kaboul, au KAF ou \u00e0 l\u2019EPR \u00e0 Kandahar. La Dre Lloyd-Jones a indiqu\u00e9 que la recommandation de ce m\u00e9decin serait diff\u00e9rente s\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de se conformer au libell\u00e9 des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan qui \u00e9taient en vigueur.\n[34] La Dre Lloyd-Jones a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au Dr Beauregard des \u00e9claircissements sur ce qu\u2019impliquait le fait de voyager jusque dans des r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es. Le 24 novembre 2009, le Dr Beauregard a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le risque de voyager \u00e9tait acceptable, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la plaignante pouvait apporter avec soi un surplus de nourriture et d\u2019insuline. Il a dit en terminant qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas se prononcer sur les risques inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019instabilit\u00e9 politique dans la r\u00e9gion. La Dre Lloyd-Jones a transmis ces informations \u00e0 M. B\u00e9dard dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n[35] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2009, France Genest (directrice, Op\u00e9rations des ressources humaines, ACDI) a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Dre Lloyd-Jones une lettre dans laquelle elle lui a demand\u00e9 de confirmer ce que l\u2019ACDI avait compris, \u00e0 savoir que la recommandation initiale de SC demeurait inchang\u00e9e, et de dire s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019effectuer une autre \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale en rapport avec la demande d\u2019affectation de la plaignante en Afghanistan dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice d\u2019affectations de 2010.\n[36] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la Dre Lloyd-Jones a inform\u00e9 Mme Genest que le Dr Beauregard avait conclu que la plaignante ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le Dr Beauregard \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la plaignante pouvait travailler et voyager en Afghanistan si : i) elle avait acc\u00e8s en tout temps \u00e0 des m\u00e9dicaments, \u00e0 du mat\u00e9riel de contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 des fournitures de r\u00e9serve, ii) elle vivait et dormait dans une pi\u00e8ce avec une personne qui \u00e9tait au courant de son probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et iii) elle disposait d\u2019aliments et de m\u00e9dicaments additionnels pour ses d\u00e9placements. Elle a conclu en disant que la d\u00e9cision finale d\u2019affecter ou non la plaignante relevait de l\u2019ACDI, tout comme celle de demander la tenue d\u2019une autre \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale en l\u2019absence de tout facteur m\u00e9dical nouveau et imp\u00e9rieux.\n[37] Le 11 janvier 2010, la plaignante a appris par Bob Johnston (directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan, ACDI) qu\u2019au vu des informations que l\u2019on avait re\u00e7ues de SC, son affectation en Afghanistan ne ferait l\u2019objet d'aucun autre examen, \u00e0 moins d\u2019un changement dans son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\nIV. Le diab\u00e8te de type 1 [38] On a diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez la plaignante un diab\u00e8te de type 1 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 10 ans et elle a suivi divers traitements au cours de sa vie. Le diab\u00e8te de type 1 est une affection dans laquelle le pancr\u00e9as ne produit plus d\u2019insuline; la plaignante est donc insulinod\u00e9pendante. Elle doit surveiller ses taux de glucose et suit une insulinoth\u00e9rapie. Elle se sert souvent d\u2019une pompe \u00e0 insuline avec capteur pour aider \u00e0 maintenir son taux de sucre dans le sang \u00e0 un niveau normal.\n[39] Les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type 1 ont besoin de suivre une insulinoth\u00e9rapie pour leur survie. Il existe diff\u00e9rents types d\u2019insuline ainsi que diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodes de prise. Une option consiste \u00e0 prendre l\u2019insuline avec une seringue ou un stylo, selon le cas. Une autre option consiste \u00e0 utiliser une pompe \u00e0 insuline, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un dispositif portatif et \u00e0 piles qui est programm\u00e9 pour dispenser de l\u2019insuline 24 heures sur 24 par un petit cath\u00e9ter ins\u00e9r\u00e9 sous la peau.\n[40] Les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type 1 doivent aussi surveiller r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leur taux de sucre dans le sang (glyc\u00e9mie). Ce taux peut \u00eatre influenc\u00e9 par un certain nombre de facteurs, dont l\u2019administration d\u2019insuline, la consommation d\u2019aliments, l\u2019exercice physique, le degr\u00e9 de stress et une maladie intercurrente. Les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type 1 courent un risque de subir \u00e0 court et \u00e0 long terme des complications, dont une maladie des reins (n\u00e9phropathie diab\u00e9tique), une maladie des yeux (r\u00e9tinopathie diab\u00e9tique), une l\u00e9sion d\u2019un nerf (neuropathie diab\u00e9tique) ou d\u2019autres maladies d\u2019organes cibles.\n[41] Les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type 1 risquent \u00e9galement de souffrir d\u2019hypoglyc\u00e9mie et d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Une hypoglyc\u00e9mie survient quand le taux de sucre dans le sang est trop faible. C\u2019est le cas lorsque la personne diab\u00e9tique ne consomme pas assez d\u2019aliments en temps opportun ou prend trop d\u2019insuline, ce qui am\u00e8ne le sucre pr\u00e9sent dans le sang \u00e0 \u00eatre consomm\u00e9 plus vite que pr\u00e9vu. Les sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019hypoglyc\u00e9mie sont les suivants : faim, anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, tremblements, sudation et irritabilit\u00e9. Si ce trouble n\u2019est pas trait\u00e9, les sympt\u00f4mes peuvent se transformer et causer de la confusion, une perte de conscience, des convulsions, voire la mort. Une personne qui subit une grave r\u00e9action hypoglyc\u00e9mique entra\u00eenant une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration des fonctions cognitives, des convulsions et le coma a besoin de l\u2019aide d\u2019une autre personne pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 ing\u00e9rer du sucre, recevoir une injection de glucagon (une hormone qui fait augmenter le taux de sucre dans le sang) ou recevoir du glucose par voie intraveineuse. Ce glucose par voie intraveineuse doit \u00eatre administr\u00e9 par une personne ayant des comp\u00e9tences m\u00e9dicales, comme un technicien m\u00e9dical, une infirmi\u00e8re ou un m\u00e9decin. Cependant, n\u2019importe qui peut suivre une formation pour donner une injection de glucagon. Dans certains cas, on rel\u00e8ve ce que l\u2019on appelle une ignorance hypoglyc\u00e9mique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les premiers signes d\u2019hypoglyc\u00e9mie passent inaper\u00e7us ou sont absents. La gravit\u00e9 des incidents hypoglyc\u00e9miques augmente en fonction de l\u2019\u00e2ge. De plus, plus une personne en est victime, plus elle risque de subir un autre incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique grave dans l\u2019avenir.\n[42] L\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie est une autre complication qui peut d\u00e9couler du diab\u00e8te de type 1. Elle survient lorsque le taux de sucre dans le sang devient trop \u00e9lev\u00e9. L\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie peut \u00eatre caus\u00e9e par de nombreux facteurs, dont une consommation excessive d\u2019aliments ou de sucre, une infection, un traumatisme, un stress accru et le fait de ne pas prendre assez d\u2019insuline en temps opportun. Parmi les sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie figurent la faim, une soif excessive, des mictions fr\u00e9quentes, une vision embrouill\u00e9e ou de la fatigue. La plupart du temps une personne rep\u00e8rera les premiers sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie et rectifiera le probl\u00e8me; par exemple, en prenant de l\u2019insuline. Sans traitement, l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie peut provoquer une complication aigu\u00eb appel\u00e9e acidoc\u00e9tose diab\u00e9tique (AD). L\u2019AD survient lorsqu\u2019un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de sucre dans le sang am\u00e8ne l\u2019organisme \u00e0 transformer les cellules adipeuses en carburant, au lieu de convertir le sucre pr\u00e9sent dans le sang. Ce processus lib\u00e8re des c\u00e9tones, qui peuvent s\u2019accumuler dans le sang et agir sur le m\u00e9tabolisme de l\u2019organisme. Parmi les signes et les sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019AD figure une haleine fruit\u00e9e, de la confusion, des naus\u00e9es, des vomissements et une perte de poids. L\u2019AD peut \u00eatre fatale et elle exige un traitement d\u2019urgence, lequel inclut l\u2019administration de liquides et d\u2019insuline et parfois une hospitalisation.\n[43] Il est souvent possible d\u2019\u00e9viter un grave incident hyperglyc\u00e9mique ou hypoglyc\u00e9mique de diverses fa\u00e7ons, ainsi qu\u2019en utilisant une pompe \u00e0 insuline avec capteur. La plaignante poss\u00e8de un syst\u00e8me appel\u00e9 CGMS (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, ou syst\u00e8me de surveillance continue du glucose). Le syst\u00e8me CGMS v\u00e9rifie automatiquement les taux de glucose dans le sang \u00e0 intervalles de quelques minutes, au moyen d\u2019un capteur ins\u00e9r\u00e9 sous la peau. Il peut faire retentir un avertisseur si les taux sont trop \u00e9lev\u00e9s ou trop bas. Il est con\u00e7u pour interagir avec une pompe \u00e0 insuline. Cette derni\u00e8re remplace l\u2019insulinoth\u00e9rapie par injection. La pompe est capable d\u2019administrer l\u2019insuline de deux fa\u00e7ons : 1) elle injecte un taux d\u2019insuline de base (une s\u00e9rie r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de faibles doses) ou 2) elle injecte un \u00ab bolus \u00bb (une dose accrue d\u2019insuline programm\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 les hydrates de carbone doivent \u00eatre consomm\u00e9s). Il est possible de suspendre ou de rajuster le taux de base au besoin. Si le syst\u00e8me CGMS ne fonctionne pas, la personne atteinte du diab\u00e8te de type 1 peut recourir au syst\u00e8me des seringues et de l\u2019insuline. Le syst\u00e8me CGMS n\u2019est pas un outil \u00e0 toute \u00e9preuve : il aide seulement \u00e0 surveiller et \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les sympt\u00f4mes diab\u00e9tiques. Bien que cet outil puisse aider \u00e0 amoindrir le risque d\u2019incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique, son usage n\u2019est pas une garantie qu\u2019un tel incident ne se r\u00e9p\u00e8tera pas. S\u2019il survenait un tel incident, la plaignante aurait besoin d\u2019une injection de glucagon. Je conclus que l\u2019utilisation du syst\u00e8me CGMS n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s bien document\u00e9e, car aucune \u00e9tude importante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e sur le sujet.\n[44] La plaignante est parfaitement au courant de son probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et des mesures \u00e0 prendre, m\u00eame durant sa grossesse (au moment de l\u2019audience). Elle a \u00e9galement une bonne connaissance de sa pompe \u00e0 insuline avec capteur et en a expliqu\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement le fonctionnement \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il existe des moyens d\u2019\u00e9viter que l\u2019eau, la chaleur et le sable \u2013 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tous pr\u00e9sents en Afghanistan \u2013 endommagent la pompe \u00e0 insuline. La plaignante proc\u00e8de \u00e0 12 lectures par jour de son taux de sucre dans le sang et elle note les r\u00e9sultats dans un calepin. Elle est en mesure de sauter des repas malgr\u00e9 son diab\u00e8te \u00e0 cause de la mani\u00e8re dont elle contr\u00f4le son taux de sucre dans le sang. Elle garde sur elle des cachets de glucose en cas de r\u00e9action hypoglyc\u00e9mique. Elle a aussi donn\u00e9 des exemples d\u2019autres aliments qu\u2019elle peut consommer dans la m\u00eame situation. Elle vit seule et fait face par elle-m\u00eame aux dangers de l\u2019hypoglyc\u00e9mie. Elle n\u2019a jamais eu de grave incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique dans son sommeil depuis qu\u2019elle vit \u00e0 Ottawa. Depuis 2009, la plaignante se sert d\u2019un capteur qui fait retentir un avertisseur; celui-ci peut la r\u00e9veiller si le taux de sucre dans son sang est trop bas. Chaque fois qu\u2019elle voyage ou qu\u2019elle travaille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, elle garde avec elle son insuline, ses aiguilles et d\u2019autres articles au cas o\u00f9 elle en aurait besoin.\nV. Les faits en litige et les positions des parties A. La position de la plaignante [45] Selon la plaignante, l\u2019ACDI et SC ont fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit du fait de son \u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique. En ce qui la concerne, son \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical ne fait nullement obstacle \u00e0 sa carri\u00e8re. Lors de son s\u00e9jour en Afghanistan, elle se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait dans un v\u00e9hicule blind\u00e9 et avait avec elle en tout temps ses fournitures m\u00e9dicales. Le lendemain de son incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique en Afghanistan, la plaignante allait bien et n\u2019a pas eu besoin de soins additionnels. Elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail comme \u00e0 l'accoutum\u00e9e. Avant son incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique, et depuis ce temps, jamais elle n\u2019a d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9e pour son diab\u00e8te. Elle affirme que, depuis l\u2019incident, elle a pris des mesures pr\u00e9ventives afin d\u2019\u00eatre s\u00fbre qu\u2019une telle situation ne se reproduise plus.\n[46] La plaignante soutient que les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan imposent une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 tous les cas de diab\u00e8te de type 1, et que cette interdiction ne tient pas compte des caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res d\u2019un diab\u00e9tique par rapport \u00e0 un autre. Elle g\u00e8re son diab\u00e8te d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui lui permet d\u2019accomplir ses t\u00e2ches sans la mettre elle-m\u00eame ou d\u2019autres personnes en danger. Elle n\u2019a besoin que du m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que celui dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient tous les autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en Afghanistan et il est fort peu probable qu\u2019on ait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vacuer \u00e0 cause de complications li\u00e9es \u00e0 son diab\u00e8te. De plus, aucun membre du personnel de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en otage pendant un s\u00e9jour en Afghanistan.\n[47] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019ACDI ne l\u2019a pas inform\u00e9e de ses droits et de ses obligations quand elle a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des mesures d\u2019accommodement. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les communications entre l\u2019ACDI et elle n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rapides et ont souvent eu lieu apr\u00e8s de longs intervalles. Elle dit qu\u2019on ne lui a jamais remis une copie de la DSE9 et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC.\n[48] Selon la plaignante, l\u2019ACDI doit tenter de trouver des mesures d\u2019accommodement qui att\u00e9nueraient \u00e0 un niveau raisonnable les risques qu\u2019elle pourrait poser et que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a fait qu\u2019une tentative minime pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. Elle dit avoir tent\u00e9 de travailler avec l\u2019ACDI en vue d\u2019\u00e9liminer tous les risques per\u00e7us qu\u2019elle pourrait poser en \u00e9tant affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. La possibilit\u00e9 de limiter toutes ses fonctions \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de protection de l\u2019a\u00e9rodrome de Kandahar a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e, tout comme la recommandation de partager une chambre avec une personne qui soit au courant de son probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et du traitement qu\u2019il exige. De plus, l\u2019ACDI aurait pu d\u00e9cider d\u2019informer ses employ\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019administrer les injections de glucagon. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 signer une d\u00e9charge de responsabilit\u00e9 afin de pouvoir \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan.\n[49] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de sa non-affectation en Afghanistan, elle n\u2019a pas acquis l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de terrain qui est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 son plan de carri\u00e8re. Si elle avait obtenu l\u2019affectation en Afghanistan, elle aurait acquis de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de programmes, de projets ou de probl\u00e8mes de gestion dans le domaine du d\u00e9veloppement international. Elle s\u2019est inscrite \u00e0 d\u2019autres concours \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en vue d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de terrain qu\u2019elle estime avoir perdue.\nB. La position des intim\u00e9s [50] L\u2019ACDI et SC ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse conjointe \u00e0 ces plaintes.\n[51] Selon les intim\u00e9s, la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan imposerait \u00e0 l\u2019employeur une contrainte excessive. Le Canada est en guerre en Afghanistan. Le danger est partout, et il est impossible que la plaignante puisse exercer en tout temps un contr\u00f4le sur son environnement. Les installations m\u00e9dicales disponibles en Afghanistan sont mal \u00e9quip\u00e9es et d\u00e9bord\u00e9es. Les \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales sont co\u00fbteuses et dangereuses, car les h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res que l\u2019on utilise \u00e0 cette fin sont souvent pris pour cible par les forces ennemies. La prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan pose un degr\u00e9 de risque inacceptable pour cette derni\u00e8re, pour les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI ainsi que pour les op\u00e9rations des Forces canadiennes. Comme la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique en Afghanistan, les intim\u00e9s consid\u00e8rent que leur position est raisonnable.\n[52] L\u2019ACDI soutient qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en \u00e9liminant l\u2019exigence de son poste qui l\u2019oblige \u00e0 voyager. De plus, une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de pays o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut d\u00e9ployer la plaignante en fonction de son \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical a \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9e et remise \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re afin de l\u2019aider dans ses plans de carri\u00e8re.\n[53] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire subir un examen m\u00e9dical aux employ\u00e9s avant de les d\u00e9ployer dans un pays \u00e9tranger. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le fait de ne pas envoyer en Afghanistan des personnes souffrant d\u2019une maladie chronique constitue une mesure d\u2019att\u00e9nuation des risques dans un milieu d\u00e9j\u00e0 instable et risqu\u00e9. L\u2019ACDI soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas l\u2019expertise n\u00e9cessaire pour se prononcer sur les questions de sant\u00e9, ce qui explique pourquoi elle se fonde sur les recommandations de SC. L\u2019ACDI n\u2019est pas la seule entit\u00e9 qui compte sur les examens m\u00e9dicaux et les recommandations de SC pour pouvoir d\u00e9ployer ses employ\u00e9s. Le minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du Commerce international (MAECI) compte lui aussi sur SC pour formuler des recommandations avant un d\u00e9ploiement. Les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ACDI ont demand\u00e9 au MAECI si ce dernier avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 une recommandation d\u00e9favorable de SC. Le MAECI a r\u00e9pondu que c\u2019\u00e9tait peu fr\u00e9quent et que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait vraisemblablement arriv\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 deux occasions distinctes.\nC. La position de la Commission [54] La Commission est d\u2019avis que l\u2019on peut consid\u00e9rer que les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan de SC imposent une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale contre l\u2019envoi en Afghanistan de toute personne atteinte du diab\u00e8te de type 1. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019ACDI peut avoir jug\u00e9 que ces directives imposent une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, car elle a cit\u00e9 la recommandation et les directives de SC en d\u00e9cidant de ne pas permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de travailler en Afghanistan.\n[55] La Commission all\u00e8gue que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est efforc\u00e9e de trouver, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, des moyens d\u2019amener \u00e0 un niveau tol\u00e9rable les risques que repr\u00e9sente la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan. Selon la Commission, comme on n\u2019a pas envisag\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019accommodement en Afghanistan, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ne peuvent pas \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es.\n[56] La Commission soutient que l\u2019ACDI a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation proc\u00e9durale d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en omettant de prendre des mesures concr\u00e8tes pour obtenir toutes les informations m\u00e9dicales pertinentes qui \u00e9taient requises pour prendre une d\u00e9cision juste, individualis\u00e9e et exhaustive. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas trait\u00e9 la plaignante de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et transparente, ou n\u2019ont pas respect\u00e9 ses besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019information et de soutien.\nVI. Le droit applicable et l\u2019analyse A. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre SC i. Une plainte peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce [57] La plainte visant SC a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au d\u00e9part en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Avec l\u2019accord des parties, cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure \u00e9galement les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Vu la relation unique qui existe entre la plaignante et SC dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il convient de se demander si les alin\u00e9as 5b), 7b) ou 10a) de la LCDP conf\u00e8rent au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019examiner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une plainte contre SC. J\u2019examinerai chacune de ces dispositions \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[58] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b)\nLe texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP est le suivant :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\n\u2026\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[59] Dans cette disposition, le mot \u00ab services \u00bb s\u2019entend de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u00ab offert \u00bb (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170, au paragraphe 31). Les mots \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb d\u00e9notent que le service offert cr\u00e9e une relation publique entre le fournisseur et l\u2019utilisateur de ce service (Dreaver c. Pankiw, 2009 TCDP 8, au paragraphe 30, et Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 RCS 571, au paragraphe 69).\n[60] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, SC ne fournit pas un service au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la plaignante, mais plut\u00f4t au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019ACDI. Cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas d\u2019expertise m\u00e9dicale et se fonde sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation que fait SC pour rendre sa propre d\u00e9cision. C\u2019est l\u2019ACDI qui demande l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e0 SC, et non l\u2019employ\u00e9e. SC n\u2019offre pas un service qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement offert \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres du public canadien.\n[61] Dans Panacci c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 114 (Panacci), la plaignante \u00e9tait une inspectrice d\u2019envois postaux \u00e0 l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada et elle souffrait d\u2019un certain nombre de troubles m\u00e9dicaux. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a instaur\u00e9 sa politique sur les mesures d\u2019adaptation et il incombait \u00e0 SC de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des \u00e9valuations des limites et des capacit\u00e9s sur le plan de la sant\u00e9. La plaignante avait port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une \u00e9valuation dans le cadre de laquelle les m\u00e9decins avaient imput\u00e9 ses dol\u00e9ances \u00e0 sa satisfaction au travail et avaient recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre division. Au stade du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, l\u2019une des questions que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait \u00e0 r\u00e9gler consistait \u00e0 savoir lequel des articles 5, 7 ou 10 de la LCDP pouvait servir de fondement \u00e0 l\u2019octroi de la comp\u00e9tence dans le cas d\u2019une plainte pour discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de SC. En ce qui concerne l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[\u2026] Les fonctionnaires publics ayant un handicap peuvent tr\u00e8s bien faire partie du public, mais ce serait \u00e9largir abusivement le sens du mot \u00ab public \u00bb que d\u2019y inclure des personnes telles que la demanderesse, une fonctionnaire qui, en ce qui concerne les besoins qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouve dans le cadre de son emploi fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation de Sant\u00e9 Canada \u2013 service qui n\u2019est pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la population canadienne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n(Panacci, au paragraphe 52)\n[62] Au vu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne crois pas qu\u2019une plainte puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre SC sur le fondement de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[63] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b)\nLe texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP est le suivant :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n\u2026\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[64] Dans le cadre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, l\u2019examen porte principalement sur une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi (voir Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 RCS 84, au paragraphe 12). Certaines d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles donnent \u00e0 penser qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, qui cadre avec la nature de la l\u00e9gislation relative aux droits de la personne (voir CN c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 RCS 1114, au paragraphe 24), am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que cette disposition englobe les situations d\u2019emploi qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre des relations directes entre employeur et employ\u00e9. Dans Fontaine c. Canadien Pacifique Lt\u00e9e (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. 288 (TCDP) (Fontaine), le Tribunal a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme suit l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP :\n[\u2026] L\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat v\u00e9ritable ou d\u2019une relation directe entre les deux parties en cause n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le mot \u00ab indirects \u00bb figurant dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne doit signifier quelque chose, ce qui constitue donc une autre raison de conclure qu\u2019un lien contractuel entre C. P. et M. Fontaine n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour autant qu\u2019il existe un degr\u00e9 important de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son emploi.\nA notre avis, il ne faut pas se demander si C. P. est vraiment l\u2019employeur de M. Fontaine, car cela ne r\u00e9pondrait pas \u00e0 la question. Pour que l\u2019article 7 s\u2019applique, il faut simplement prouver que la conduite reproch\u00e9e est attribuable \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qui avait un degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le ou une influence consid\u00e9rable sur l\u2019employeur r\u00e9el et, indirectement, sur son employ\u00e9.\n(Fontaine, aux paragraphes 30 et 31)\n[65] La d\u00e9cision Fontaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Canadien Pacifique Lt\u00e9e. c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1991] 1 CF 571 (Canadien Pacifique)); cependant, pour ce qui est de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que le Tribunal a faite de l\u2019article 7, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab [i]l se peut que le tribunal se soit exprim\u00e9 maladroitement \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards \u00bb (Canadien Pacifique, au paragraphe 11). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u00ab employer \u00bb et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s (employeur, emploi) comme signifiant \u00ab utiliser \u00bb et elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que le Tribunal. M\u00eame si cette d\u00e9cision semble restreindre l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui est faite de l\u2019article 7 dans Fontaine, la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue r\u00e9cemment dans Panacci offre un point de vue nouveau sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cette disposition. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, dans la d\u00e9cision Panacci la question soumise au contr\u00f4le judiciaire consistait \u00e0 savoir si une plainte pour discrimination pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP contre SC sur le fondement de ses \u00e9valuations de l\u2019aptitude du point de vue m\u00e9dical et des limites, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada qui \u00e9tait l\u2019employeur de la plaignante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nL\u2019article 10 pose la question de savoir qui est l\u2019\u00ab employ\u00e9 \u00bb, mais cette disposition peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme englobant des situations allant au-del\u00e0 du lien \u00ab direct \u00bb entre employeur et employ\u00e9 (voir par exemple Canadien Pacifique Lt\u00e9e. c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1991] 1 C.F. 571 (C.A.F.), [1990] A.C.F. no 1028). Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai lorsque la Cour est tenue d\u2019adopter une interpr\u00e9tation \u00ab large et lib\u00e9rale \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une loi r\u00e9paratrice.\nIl n\u2019est par cons\u00e9quent pas \u00ab clair et \u00e9vident \u00bb (selon le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9crit dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Association canadienne des ma\u00eetres de poste et adjoints), [1997] A.C.F. no 578 (1re inst.), conf. par [1999] A.C.F. no 705 (C.A.F.)) que les articles 7 et 10 ne pourraient pas s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la plainte de la demanderesse. La question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du Tribunal, s\u2019il estimait que les faits de l\u2019affaire justifiaient effectivement l\u2019application de ces deux dispositions.\n(Panacci, aux paragraphes 54 et 55)\n[66] En fin de compte, la Cour semble indiquer que la d\u00e9termination de la disposition applicable comporte l\u2019analyse suivante :\nCe qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de savoir, c\u2019est quel minist\u00e8re a commis les actes discriminatoires et devrait donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00ab partie \u00bb pour qu\u2019il puisse se voir enjoindre de prendre des mesures correctives efficaces. Il ne faut pas oublier que la Loi vise essentiellement la prise de mesures correctives et que l\u2019enqu\u00eate doit porter sur ce qui s\u2019est effectivement produit \u00ab dans le cadre de l\u2019emploi \u00bb du plaignant (voir Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84). Personne ne met en doute en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission relativement \u00e0 la plainte de la demanderesse. La question soulev\u00e9e \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t celle de savoir de laquelle des trois dispositions la Commission tenait sa comp\u00e9tence.\n(Panacci, au paragraphe 51)\n[67] En me fondant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de l\u2019article 7 qu\u2019a expos\u00e9e la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Panacci, je conclus que cette disposition s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. SC a \u00e9tabli une directive et une m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale qui s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la plaignante \u00ab en cours d\u2019emploi \u00bb. Cette derni\u00e8re soutient que la directive et le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ont \u00e9tabli contre elle une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, un motif de distinction illicite. Cela \u00e9tant, il existe un fondement factuel qui permet de justifier l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre SC en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[68] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a)\nLe texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP est le suivant :\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\n\u2026\n[69] Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7, \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP, le l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9cise que seuls l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale peuvent \u00eatre tenus responsables d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier, [1999] 1 CF 113 (CAF) (Bell Canada), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les mots op\u00e9rants du paragraphe 11(1) de la LCDP (\u00ab Constitue un acte discriminatoire [\u2026] pour l\u2019employeur [\u2026] \u00bb) tenaient \u00ab [\u2026] uniquement l\u2019employeur responsable des disparit\u00e9s salariales relativement au travail de valeur \u00e9gale \u00bb (Bell Canada, au paragraphe 56). Et d\u2019ajouter la Cour :\n[\u2026] Conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales des syndicats, soit implicitement en vertu de l'article 11, soit indirectement au moyen de dispositions comme l'article 10, pour avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la fixation de salaires diff\u00e9rents relativement \u00e0 un travail de valeur \u00e9gale irait carr\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'encontre du texte clair de la Loi et de l'intention \u00e9vidente du l\u00e9gislateur.\n(Bell Canada, au paragraphe 56)\n[70] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Cour a faite du paragraphe 11(1) de la LCDP dans la d\u00e9cision Bell Canada s\u2019applique tout autant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui est faite de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Seuls les employeurs, les associations patronales ou les organisations syndicales peuvent \u00eatre tenus responsables aux termes de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP. Comme SC n\u2019est pas l\u2019employeur de la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, rien ne permet de fonder une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre SC sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nii. La plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination [71] Dans une instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, la partie plaignante doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28). Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l\u2019unique motif des actes en litige pour qu\u2019un plaignant obtienne gain de cause. Il suffit que la discrimination ne soit qu\u2019un des fondements des actes ou des d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019employeur (voir Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada Limit\u00e9e (1990), 112 N.R. 395 (C.A.F.) et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569). Cependant, les all\u00e9gations que formule un plaignant doivent \u00eatre cr\u00e9dibles pour pouvoir \u00e9tayer une conclusion selon laquelle il existe une preuve prima facie (voir Dhanjal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (1997), 139 FTR 37 (CF)). Une fois qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de donner une explication raisonnable qui montre soit que la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu, soit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire.\n[72] Le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2008, quand l\u2019\u00ab incident \u00bb est survenu, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Canada parce que l\u2019interniste a recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus s\u00fbr pour elle et pour d\u2019autres personnes qu\u2019elle ne reste pas en Afghanistan. \u00c0 la suite de cet incident, les militaires se sont dits m\u00e9contents du fait qu\u2019aucun contr\u00f4le m\u00e9dical n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avant d\u2019envoyer des civils en Afghanistan pour une affectation d\u2019une dur\u00e9e maximale d\u2019un an. Ce m\u00e9contentement a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI dans un courriel du Major Thurlow, qui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi les employ\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas m\u00e9dicalement contr\u00f4l\u00e9s avant d\u2019\u00eatre envoy\u00e9s dans une zone de guerre si leur affectation \u00e9tait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 un an. L\u2019ACDI retient habituellement les services de SC pour \u00e9valuer si les employ\u00e9s sont m\u00e9dicalement aptes avant de les envoyer en mission en Afghanistan ou dans d\u2019autres pays. SC a modifi\u00e9 les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, une annexe du GEST, en vue d\u2019inclure des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb, qualifi\u00e9es par la plaignante et la Commission d\u2019[traduction]\u00ab interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb. Selon les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, une personne souffrant d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 chronique ne peut pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. La plaignante souffre d\u2019une affection, le diab\u00e8te de type 1. La d\u00e9ficience fait partie des motifs de distinction illicites qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP, et elle est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 en ces termes : \u00ab [d]\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, quelle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e \u00bb. \u00c9tant une d\u00e9ficience physique, le diab\u00e8te tombe sous le coup de la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb que l\u2019on trouve dans la LCDP. Quand la plaignante a demand\u00e9 de retourner en Afghanistan et qu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa candidature en vue d\u2019une affectation et a suivi en fin de compte le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale \u00e9tabli pour les affectations, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu\u2019elle ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences relatives \u00e0 une affectation en Afghanistan par tous les m\u00e9decins de SC ainsi que par l\u2019endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant dont les services avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus dans le cadre du processus. M\u00eame si le sp\u00e9cialiste ind\u00e9pendant a tout d\u2019abord conclu que la plaignante \u00e9tait en mesure de satisfaire aux exigences d\u2019une affectation sous certaines conditions, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de renseignements de SC au sujet des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante n\u2019y satisfaisait pas. Je conclus \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 cause des directives et des processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation de SC du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\niii. SC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire [73] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les responsabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019assument les intim\u00e9s sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la plaignante sont entrelac\u00e9es. L\u2019ACDI demande que les employ\u00e9s soient m\u00e9dicalement [traduction] \u00ab aptes \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00bb avant qu\u2019une affectation soit confirm\u00e9e et concr\u00e9tis\u00e9e. La recommandation de SC joue un r\u00f4le crucial dans le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. La d\u00e9cision que prend l\u2019ACDI d\u2019affecter une personne ou non repose sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation et le raisonnement de SC, sauf si l\u2019ACDI exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la recommandation de SC. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que la recommandation m\u00e9dicale de SC a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019ACDI de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan.\n[74] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la Dre Baxter, le CCM-SC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il obtiendrait un troisi\u00e8me avis m\u00e9dical et que l\u2019avis de ce troisi\u00e8me endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant serait retenu. SC a inform\u00e9 la plaignante de la d\u00e9cision du CCM-SC. Quand l\u2019endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant, le Dr Beauregard, a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que la plaignante \u00e9tait jug\u00e9e apte, et apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a obtenu un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 la suite de ses \u00e9valuations psychologiques et de degr\u00e9 de stress, des \u00e9valuations reposant sur les garanties de SC selon lesquelles l\u2019avis de l\u2019examinateur ind\u00e9pendant serait accept\u00e9, la plaignante s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. Au lieu de souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019avis exprim\u00e9, SC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises des \u00e9claircissements au Dr Beauregard, en insistant pour qu\u2019il jette un coup d\u2019\u0153il aux Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan dans le cadre de son processus d\u2019\u00e9claircissement. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 SC, le Dr Beauregard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s\u2019il fallait interpr\u00e9ter les exigences comme une [traduction] \u00ab absence absolue de troubles m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb susceptibles de mettre la vie en p\u00e9ril, la plaignante ne serait pas une candidate id\u00e9ale \u00e0 un d\u00e9ploiement. SC a alors recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan.\n[75] Les exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues que comportent les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ont \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur d\u00e9terminant qui a amen\u00e9 l\u2019endocrinologue \u00e0 changer d\u2019avis. Ce dernier a jug\u00e9 que ces exigences instauraient une [traduction] \u00ab interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb, une description des directives qui, selon moi, ne vient pas du m\u00e9decin lui-m\u00eame (ce terme a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par la plaignante et la Commission); cependant, je suis fermement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les exigences m\u00e9dicales \u00e9taient absolues. Il ressort de la preuve que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb que le Dr Beauregard a faite n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e ou clarifi\u00e9e par SC. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je conclus qu\u2019il y a un probl\u00e8me dans la fa\u00e7on dont les \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan sont libell\u00e9es et que ces derni\u00e8res donnent donc lieu \u00e0 plus d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation.\n[76] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada d\u00e9clare :\n[\u2026] Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[...]\nLes employeurs qui con\u00e7oivent des normes pour le milieu de travail doivent \u00eatre conscients des diff\u00e9rences entre les personnes et des diff\u00e9rences qui caract\u00e9risent des groupes de personnes. Ils doivent int\u00e9grer des notions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans les normes du milieu de travail. En adoptant des lois sur les droits de la personne et en pr\u00e9voyant leur application au milieu de travail, les l\u00e9gislatures ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les normes r\u00e9gissant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail devraient tenir compte de tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est raisonnablement possible de le faire. Les cours de justice et les tribunaux administratifs doivent avoir cela \u00e0 l\u2019esprit lorsqu\u2019ils sont saisis d\u2019une demande dans laquelle l\u2019existence de discrimination li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emploi est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La norme qui fait inutilement abstraction des diff\u00e9rences entre les personnes va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des interdictions contenues dans les diverses lois sur les droits de la personne et doit \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e. La norme elle-m\u00eame doit permettre de tenir compte de la situation de chacun, lorsqu\u2019il est raisonnablement possible de le faire. Il se peut que la norme qui permet un tel accommodement ne soit que l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente de la norme existante, mais il reste qu\u2019elle constitue une norme diff\u00e9rente.\n(Meiorin, aux paragraphes 62 et 68)\n[77] M\u00eame si les directives sont con\u00e7ues pour \u00eatre instructives et informatives, leur libell\u00e9 d\u00e9note qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019exigences m\u00e9dicales imp\u00e9ratives qui ne tiennent pas compte de la situation individualis\u00e9e de chaque personne. Les m\u00e9decins de SC pourraient comprendre la nature informative des directives, mais un m\u00e9decin ind\u00e9pendant, comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, pourrait consid\u00e9rer que les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan sont imp\u00e9ratives ou absolues. En fait, en contre\u2011interrogatoire, l\u2019un des auteurs des Directives a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus que probable qu\u2019une personne lisant ces derni\u00e8res interpr\u00e9terait les exigences m\u00e9dicales qu\u2019elles renferment comme \u00e9tant absolument n\u00e9cessaires. La terminologie utilis\u00e9e dans les Directives donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019aucune personne souffrant d\u2019une affection chronique ne sera admissible \u00e0 une affectation en Afghanistan. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Dr Beauregard, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ne d\u00e9notent pas que l\u2019on tient compte de ce que sont exactement les restrictions li\u00e9es au probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de la personne et si ces restrictions peuvent tout de m\u00eame satisfaire aux exigences m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 une affectation en Afghanistan. Si l\u2019on veut faire \u00e9voluer les droits de la personne, les principes qui s\u2019y rapportent doivent \u00eatre pris en compte au moment d\u2019\u00e9laborer une politique et une directive. Les organisations doivent veiller \u00e0 ce que les politiques ou les directives sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme aux principes relatifs aux droits de la personne.\n[78] Le processus par lequel SC a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la situation et est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 sa recommandation, sous l\u2019influence des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, n\u2019a pas non plus tenu compte de la valeur et de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de la plaignante. L\u2019article 2 de la LCDP prescrit que la Loi a pour objet de donner effet aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de tous les individus. La notion d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 signifie : \u00ab [\u2026] le respect de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 tout \u00eatre humain, sans \u00e9gards \u00e0 sa couleur, \u00e0 sa race, \u00e0 sa langue, \u00e0 son sexe ou \u00e0 sa religion \u00bb (Warman c. Tremaine, 2007 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 97). La valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque individu sont \u00e9galement reconnues dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme, R\u00e9s. AG 217 A (III), Doc. N.U. A\/810 (1948) 71 :\nAttendu que la reconnaissance de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente et des droits \u00e9gaux et inali\u00e9nables de chacun constitue le fondement de la libert\u00e9, de la justice et de la paix dans le monde; [\u2026]\n[79] De plus, l\u2019article premier de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme indique :\nTous les \u00eatres humains naissent libres et \u00e9gaux en dignit\u00e9 et en droits. Ils sont dou\u00e9s de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternit\u00e9.\n[80] Par ailleurs, le pr\u00e9ambule du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, 19 d\u00e9cembre 1966, 999 RTNU 171, art. 9-14, R.T. Can. 1976 no 47, 6 I.L.M. 368 (entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 23 mars 1976, adh\u00e9sion par le Canada le 19 mai 1976), indique :\nLes \u00c9tats parties au pr\u00e9sent Pacte,\nConsid\u00e9rant que, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Charte des Nations Unies, la reconnaissance de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 tous les membres de la famille humaine et de leurs droits \u00e9gaux et inali\u00e9nables constitue le fondement de la libert\u00e9, de la justice et de la paix dans le monde,\nReconnaissant que ces droits d\u00e9coulent de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la personne humaine, [\u2026]\n[81] En outre, la Convention relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es, adopt\u00e9e le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2006 lors de la soixante et uni\u00e8me session de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par la r\u00e9solution A\/RES\/61\/106, et que le Canada a sign\u00e9e le 30 mars 2007 et ratifi\u00e9e le 11 mars 2010, mentionne \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a h) de son pr\u00e9ambule :\nReconnaissant \u00e9galement que toute discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap est une n\u00e9gation de la dignit\u00e9 et de la valeur inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la personne humaine, [\u2026]\n[82] La dignit\u00e9 humaine est bafou\u00e9e lorsque \u00ab [\u2026] des personnes et des groupes sont marginalis\u00e9s, mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et d\u00e9valoris\u00e9s [\u2026] \u00bb (Law c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 1 RCS 497, au paragraphe 53). Le t\u00e9moin de SC a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il \u00e9tait erron\u00e9 de dire \u00e0 la plaignante que l\u2019on se conformerait \u00e0 l\u2019avis de l\u2019endocrinologue ind\u00e9pendant [traduction] \u00ab quel qu\u2019il soit \u00bb. Ce t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re avait conclu que le Dr Beauregard \u00e9tait partial car il n\u2019avait pas pris en consid\u00e9ration la totalit\u00e9 des informations qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises la premi\u00e8re fois et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par la motivation personnelle de la patiente \u00e0 aller en Afghanistan. Sous serment, le Dr Beauregard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante paraissait \u00eatre une employ\u00e9e tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tente et que, s\u2019il se trouvait \u00e0 la place des employeurs, il l\u2019aurait certainement embauch\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que s\u2019il survenait un enl\u00e8vement, les ravisseurs voudraient que leur otage reste en vie. M\u00eame si j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au Dr Beauregard qu\u2019il devait t\u00e9moigner sur son champ d\u2019expertise, il ressort de ces commentaires que les pr\u00e9occupations de SC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la partialit\u00e9 du Dr Beauregard \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es. Selon moi, quand le CCM-SC a recommand\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un troisi\u00e8me avis et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y souscrirait, il s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 dans une situation difficile lorsqu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce troisi\u00e8me avis \u00e9tait partial. Apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu\u2019il souscrirait au troisi\u00e8me avis, quel qu\u2019il soit, le CCM-SC a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des attentes chez la plaignante. M\u00eame s\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9claircissements quand il a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019avis d\u00e9clarait que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, il n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements quand l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9. Comme cela ne faisait pas partie de sa pratique, SC n\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 ou tent\u00e9 de rencontrer le Dr Beauregard afin de d\u00e9terminer le fondement de son avis selon lequel la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, ou d\u2019expliquer la nature instructionnelle des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan.\n[83] De plus, la section 1 du GEST indique ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLe GEST a pour but d\u2019aider l\u2019examinateur \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions, et non \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une s\u00e9rie de normes strictes. Aucun manuel ou aucune s\u00e9rie de normes ne peut se substituer au jugement fond\u00e9 sur la connaissance qu\u2019a l\u2019examinateur de la personne, du travail et des circonstances dans lesquelles ce dernier sera accompli.\nLes normes contenues dans le pr\u00e9sent guide sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es \u00e0 dessein d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui oblige \u00e0 exercer une saine expertise m\u00e9dicale, en tenant compte des exigences de la t\u00e2che \u00e0 accomplir et des pratiques en vigueur dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 au travail.\nQuand une personne est incapable de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 au travail qui sont expos\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent guide pour un poste donn\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re employeur est tenu de r\u00e9aliser, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, des tests m\u00e9dicaux additionnels ou de prendre d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019accommodement. Dans le cadre de son obligation de prendre toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la personne, l\u2019examen sera fait en consultation avec le MST r\u00e9gional de SC.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[84] Il ressort de la preuve que, m\u00eame s\u2019il participe activement \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 jour des directives du GEST en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales et qu\u2019il demeure disponible pour toute consultation men\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019employeur au sujet du GEST, de la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement ou de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de tests m\u00e9dicaux additionnels, SC n\u2019a jamais \u00e9clairci aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ACDI que l\u2019avis du Dr Beauregard avait chang\u00e9 quand ce dernier avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les exigences figurant dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab absolues \u00bb. SC n\u2019a jamais expliqu\u00e9 au Dr Beauregard que le GEST n\u2019a pas pour but de pr\u00e9senter une s\u00e9rie de normes strictes. SC a simplement souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion du Dr Beauregard \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des [traduction] \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb et a transmis les informations \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI. M\u00eame si la Dre Lloyd\u2011Jones, de SC, a transmis \u00e0 Cl\u00e9ment B\u00e9dard (adjoint aux programmes, Centre de gestion des affectations, ACDI) les deux avis du Dr Beauregard dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 novembre 2009, \u00e0 savoir que la plaignante pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e si certaines conditions \u00e9taient respect\u00e9es, ainsi que l\u2019autre avis, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019au vu des exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues, la plaignante ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas la candidate id\u00e9ale, cela ne suffit pas pour montrer que SC a agi de mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire. Dans la transmission et la communication des \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales, il manquait de contexte et d\u2019information. Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2009, France Genest (directrice, Ressources humaines, Op\u00e9rations, ACDI) a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la Dre Lloyd-Jones pour demander si ses conclusions selon lesquelles la Dre Baxter et le Dr Beauregard partageaient le m\u00eame avis \u00e9taient exactes. SC n\u2019a rien fait pour clarifier la nuance entre les deux. L\u2019\u00e9valuation que la Dre Baxter a faite de la plaignante ne tenait pas compte des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la Dre Baxter a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation, les directives existaient sous forme d\u2019\u00e9bauche et n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en application. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de la Dre Baxter a amen\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 conclure que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une candidate id\u00e9ale \u00e0 une affectation en Afghanistan. Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que le Dr Beauregard est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Cependant, une seule \u00e9valuation a tenu compte des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb qui figuraient dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Le Dr Beauregard a tout d\u2019abord conclu que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 recevoir une affectation en Afghanistan sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan que le Dr Beauregard a chang\u00e9 sa recommandation et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas la candidate id\u00e9ale. Sans l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la Dre Baxter est que la plaignante ne devrait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, et l\u2019\u00e9valuation du Dr Beauregard est que la plaignante pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions. Sachant que la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive relevait de l\u2019ACDI, SC devait veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019information soit la plus exacte et compl\u00e8te que possible.\n[85] Je conclus que le probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side, en partie, dans la fa\u00e7on dont SC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire face \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 per\u00e7ue du m\u00e9decin. M\u00eame si SC a conclu que le Dr Beauregard \u00e9tait partial, il a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la recommandation de ce dernier selon laquelle il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9aliser des tests additionnels. D\u2019une part, SC a suivi ce que recommandait le Dr Beauregard (soumettre la plaignante \u00e0 des tests) et, d\u2019autre part, il a mis en doute le jugement de ce m\u00e9decin parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait ind\u00e9pendant. Quand les r\u00e9sultats des tests se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s en fin de compte positifs, SC a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une difficult\u00e9 parce que, l\u00e0 encore, il a amplifi\u00e9 les attentes de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une affectation.\n[86] Pendant tout le processus, on n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de la plaignante : de fausses attentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suscit\u00e9es et, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de SC, le processus n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 opportun. Dans l\u2019ensemble, il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus d\u2019un an et demi entre le moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 travailler en Afghanistan par l\u2019entremise du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC, et celui o\u00f9 l\u2019ACDI a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la plaignante ne pouvait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. Les m\u00e9decins de SC sont occup\u00e9s, mais cela n\u2019explique pas ce long d\u00e9lai, si l\u2019on tient compte du fait que ces \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales ne sont valables que pour six mois. La preuve montre aussi que le processus d\u2019affectation d\u00e9bute habituellement au mois de septembre d\u2019une certaine ann\u00e9e et qu\u2019une fois que la p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e9sentation des candidatures est termin\u00e9e, il faut attendre au mois de septembre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante pour avoir de nouveau la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature. Le processus \u00e9tant con\u00e7u de cette mani\u00e8re, il est d\u00e9raisonnable d\u2019exiger qu\u2019une personne attende plusieurs mois avant d\u2019obtenir des informations m\u00e9dicales et de perdre ainsi la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre part \u00e0 un processus d\u2019affectation.\n[87] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il est \u00e9vident que le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan donnent des r\u00e9sultats qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 leur objet. Il est important de refl\u00e9ter les droits de la personne non seulement dans la teneur d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019une directive, mais aussi dans sa communication et dans son r\u00e9sultat ultime. L\u2019intention d\u2019une directive ou d\u2019une politique peut \u00eatre l\u00e9gitime, mais la fa\u00e7on dont elle est exprim\u00e9e ou appliqu\u00e9e peut \u00eatre lacunaire. Dans cette optique, il est important d\u2019en surveiller les effets. La communication d\u2019un message et d\u2019une directive par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019une ligne directrice aura un meilleur effet si ce message ou cette directive sont non seulement bien communiqu\u00e9s, mais aussi bien surveill\u00e9s. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de surveiller les directives et les politiques, de m\u00eame que leurs effets, surtout dans le contexte des droits de la personne :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Surveillance \u00bb collecte active, v\u00e9rification et utilisation imm\u00e9diate de renseignements en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la protection des droits de l\u2019homme.\n(Bureau du Haut-commissariat aux droits de l\u2019homme, Training Manual on Human Rights Monitoring, UN Doc. E.01.X1V.2 (2001), aux pages 3, 9)\n[88] Une fois qu\u2019une ligne directrice ou une politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, il est important de mettre en place de bons processus de gestion des risques afin d\u2019\u00e9viter de commettre d\u2019autres violations ou injustices en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de sondages et de rapports, un bon syst\u00e8me de gestion des risques \u00e9valuera souvent l\u2019effet d\u2019une ligne directrice ou d\u2019une politique afin de garantir que l\u2019on s\u2019acquitte de son objet sans violer un droit ou une obligation quelconque. Cette surveillance et ce syst\u00e8me de correction des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s peuvent aider \u00e0 rectifier tout effet n\u00e9gatif et rehausser la politique ou la ligne directrice afin qu\u2019elle refl\u00e8te mieux son objet. Pour mettre en \u0153uvre une ligne directrice ou une politique efficace, il faudrait qu\u2019une organisation consulte des experts dans divers domaines, dont des sp\u00e9cialistes en droit de la personne. Dans tout processus ayant une incidence sur les droits d\u2019une personne, comme dans les questions relatives au travail, il est indispensable d\u2019informer cette personne de ses droits et recours. Il est important aussi d\u2019entretenir un dialogue transparent avec la personne de mani\u00e8re opportune, compl\u00e8te et \u00e0 jour. Le but est de respecter la dignit\u00e9 humaine dans ces questions li\u00e9es au travail, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 il est n\u00e9cessaire de subir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale en vue d\u2019une affectation professionnelle. Le fait de prendre en compte tous ces facteurs contribue \u00e0 rehausser les normes de justice dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux droits de la personne qui sont consacr\u00e9s dans notre Constitution et au caract\u00e8re quasi constitutionnel de la LCDP.\n[89] Dans les affaires de discrimination, la norme de preuve est la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve. Il est donc possible de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination quand les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la discrimination rendent cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles. (Voir Premakumar c. Air Canada (2002), 42 CHRR D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 81). Je conclus qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ne refl\u00e8tent pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019application de ces directives \u00e0 la plaignante a eu pour r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au cours de son \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. SC n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que sa conduite n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019en cours d\u2019emploi, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience par le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Sur le fondement du raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, SC a viol\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\nB. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACDI i. La plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination [90] La plaignante travaillait dans le cadre du programme de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019ACDI en Afghanistan et elle y a contribu\u00e9. Elle a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 deux missions temporaires diff\u00e9rentes dans ce pays, et tous les membres de son \u00e9quipe ont fini par y \u00eatre affect\u00e9s, sauf elle. Selon la preuve factuelle, elle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une employ\u00e9e comp\u00e9tente et, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9ficience et de l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e dans ce pays comme le reste de son \u00e9quipe. L\u2019ACDI, dans sa d\u00e9cision finale de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan, a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019information et les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales de SC ainsi que le fait que la plaignante ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. De ce fait, l\u2019ACDI a poursuivi, conform\u00e9ment aux politiques et aux directives de SC, une pratique relative aux \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales qui a priv\u00e9 la plaignante d\u2019une occasion d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite : sa d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP.\n[91] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, une \u00ab diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019une \u00ab distinction entre des personnes ou des groupes de personnes, laquelle distinction est pr\u00e9judiciable ou dommageable \u00e0 une personne ou \u00e0 un groupe de personnes \u00bb (Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2009 CF 1009, au paragraphe 44; d\u00e9cision modifi\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs dans Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2010 CAF 192). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, la plaignante a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre elle et ses coll\u00e8gues de travail du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience par l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Cette distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 la carri\u00e8re de la plaignante car celle-ci a perdu l\u2019occasion de travailler et d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience de terrain en Afghanistan. Je conclus donc qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre l\u2019ACDI au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\n[92] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP, il incombe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de prouver que ces pratiques discriminatoires \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ).\nii. La pratique discriminatoire de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e [93] Le texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP est le suivant :\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[\u2026]\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[94] Aux termes du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mentionner express\u00e9ment les facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse des mesures d\u2019accommodement : la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les co\u00fbts. Cependant, dans la d\u00e9cision Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada c. Kelly, 2011 CF 120 (Kelly), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 :\nCela ne veut pas dire que des questions telles que le moral et la mobilit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s, l\u2019ing\u00e9rence dans les droits d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s et la rupture d\u2019une convention collective ne seront jamais pertinentes dans le cadre d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. [\u2026] ces questions, pour \u00eatre prises en compte dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse de l\u2019accommodement, doivent \u00eatre suffisamment graves pour avoir un effet d\u00e9montrable sur les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un employeur, et ce, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui est li\u00e9e aux co\u00fbts, \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n(Kelly, au paragraphe 402)\n[95] De plus, bien que le paragraphe 15(2) soit assujetti au paragraphe 15(9) de la LCDP, lequel pr\u00e9voit l\u2019obligation de service impos\u00e9e aux membres des Forces canadiennes, la plaignante n\u2019est pas membre des Forces canadiennes et, de ce fait, le paragraphe 15(9) ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (voir Irvine c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2004 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32; d\u00e9cision confirm\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans Irvine c.

British Columbia Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, [1999] 3 RCS 3 (Meiorin), comme suit :\n1) qu\u2019il [l\u2019employeur] a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\n2) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n3) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n(Meorin, au paragraphe 54)\nLes volets Un et Deux\n[97] Le premier volet de l\u2019analyse expos\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin examine la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme. Le deuxi\u00e8me volet \u00e9value l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait l\u2019employeur au moment d\u2019adopter cette norme. Ces volets garantissent que \u00ab la norme, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e sur le plan aussi bien objectif que subjectif, ne comporte pas de fondement discriminatoire \u00bb (Kelly, au paragraphe 356; voir aussi l\u2019arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, au paragraphe 14 (Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill)). Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le premier et le deuxi\u00e8me volets de l\u2019analyse issue de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits. Par cons\u00e9quent, je traiterai bri\u00e8vement de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils s\u2019appliquent dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\n[98] Les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan pr\u00e9cisent que les employ\u00e9s sont tenus de satisfaire \u00e0 certaines exigences m\u00e9dicales pour pouvoir \u00eatre affect\u00e9s en Afghanistan. Elles font \u00e9tat de conditions climatiques d\u00e9favorables qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s, dont une chaleur extr\u00eame, une pollution atmosph\u00e9rique \u00e9lev\u00e9e et une exposition \u00e0 des maladies infectieuses. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan mentionnent que l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux traitements m\u00e9dicaux est fort restreint ou peut m\u00eame ne pas \u00eatre disponible. Elles indiquent aussi que les voyages en Afghanistan pr\u00e9sentent un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 de blessure ou de mort et que les employ\u00e9s vivent sous la menace d\u2019attaques physiques, m\u00eame dans les zones s\u00e9curis\u00e9es. Les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan sont donc con\u00e7ues de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour d\u00e9terminer si un employ\u00e9 est capable de r\u00e9sister aux stress qu\u2019imposent les conditions de guerre en Afghanistan, ainsi que pour r\u00e9duire le plus possible la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de recevoir des soins m\u00e9dicaux, qui sont principalement mis en place pour les militaires en vue de traiter les maladies et les blessures que subissent les troupes, les civils afghans bless\u00e9s et les situations d\u2019urgence impr\u00e9visibles qui touchent tous les civils en mission en Afghanistan.\n[99] Il ressort de la preuve que les pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan sont l\u00e9gitimes et que, en Afghanistan, les soins m\u00e9dicaux sont bel et bien limit\u00e9s. Un aper\u00e7u d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019une norme relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 est rationnellement li\u00e9e aux conditions de travail auxquelles sont expos\u00e9s les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI en Afghanistan.\n[100] Rien n\u2019indique dans la preuve que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019imposition de la norme n\u2019\u00e9tait pas jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire ou \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par une animosit\u00e9 discriminatoire \u00bb (Meiorin, au paragraphe 60). Je conclus donc que l\u2019on a adopt\u00e9 les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan en croyant honn\u00eatement et de bonne foi qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un but professionnel l\u00e9gitime et que les deux premiers volets de l\u2019analyse issue de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin sont satisfaits.\nLe volet Trois\n[101] Le troisi\u00e8me volet de l\u2019analyse issue de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin \u00ab [\u2026] consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la norme est exig\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser un but l\u00e9gitime, et si l\u2019employeur peut composer avec la plaignante sans subir une contrainte excessive \u00bb (Kelly, au paragraphe 356; voir aussi Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill, au paragraphe 14). L\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab excessive \u00bb implique qu\u2019une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque la contrainte est \u00ab excessive \u00bb qu\u2019elle satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re (voir Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, \u00e0 la page 984). En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb signifie \u00ab disproportionn\u00e9, ill\u00e9gitime, immod\u00e9r\u00e9, excessif ou oppressif \u00bb et ce stade est atteint \u00ab [\u2026] lorsque les moyens raisonnables d\u2019accommoder ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ne reste que des options d\u2019accommodement d\u00e9raisonnables ou irr\u00e9alistes \u00bb (Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2007 CSC 15, aux paragraphes 130 et 140). La partie plaignante se doit de faciliter la recherche d\u2019une mesure s\u00e9rieuse en r\u00e9pondant aux demandes raisonnables que formule l\u2019employeur en vue d\u2019obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents sur ses limites et de lui permettre ainsi de formuler une proposition (Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 CHRT 8 et Graham c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 CHRT 40). Toutefois, un employ\u00e9 ne peut pas dicter \u00e0 un employeur les conditions exactes d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement et il ne peut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on trouve une solution parfaite (voir Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill, et Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Environnement), 2003 CAF 133).\n[102] L\u2019id\u00e9al serait peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019un employeur adopte une pratique ou une norme qui soit d\u2019une rigidit\u00e9 absolue, mais pour qu\u2019elle soit justifi\u00e9e, il faut qu\u2019elle prenne en compte des facteurs qui sont li\u00e9s aux capacit\u00e9s uniques et \u00e0 la valeur et \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque individu, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019impose aucune contrainte excessive (Meiorin, au paragraphe 62.). De plus, lorsqu\u2019un employeur \u00e9value s\u2019il est en mesure de prendre une mesure d\u2019accommodement en faveur d\u2019un employ\u00e9, il est tenu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de cet employ\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [l]e caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 du processus d\u2019accommodement ne saurait \u00eatre minimis\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[103] \u00c0 ce stade, l\u2019analyse porte sur \u00ab [\u2026] d\u2019abord, la proc\u00e9dure [\u2026] qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l\u2019accommodement et, ensuite, la teneur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte ou, subsidiairement, celle des raisons pour lesquelles l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas offert une telle norme \u00bb (Meiorin, au paragraphe 66). Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019examinerai, en premier lieu, la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019ACDI a adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer le probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante et les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles et, en second lieu, si le fait de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan causerait \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI une contrainte excessive.\nLa proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer le probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante et les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles\n[104] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019ACDI ne poss\u00e8de pas d\u2019expertise m\u00e9dicale et elle s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC et les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan pour d\u00e9cider que la plaignante ne pouvait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. En avril 2008, s\u2019appuyant sur la recommandation de SC, l\u2019ACDI a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour une affectation en Afghanistan. Apr\u00e8s avoir appris que l\u2019ACDI avait en fin de compte le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider si elle pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan, ind\u00e9pendamment de la recommandation de SC, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI d\u2019exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 travailler en Afghanistan : pour tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, l\u2019ACDI s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e dans l\u2019obligation d\u2019obtenir tous les renseignements pertinents sur la d\u00e9ficience de l\u2019employ\u00e9e et d\u2019examiner s\u00e9rieusement s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en sa faveur (voir ADGA Group Consultants Inc. c. Lane et al., 91 O.R. (3d) 649, au paragraphe 107 (Lane)). L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande initiale de la plaignante, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour lui permettre d\u2019aller en Afghanistan. L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 la plaignante des proc\u00e9dures d\u00e9crites dans la DSE9, du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC ou du GEST, et les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ACDI qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne les connaissaient pas. La preuve soumise au Tribunal contient un courriel de Marion Parry, qui travaille au sein des Programmes de mobilit\u00e9 et d\u00e9veloppement de carri\u00e8re, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des ressources humaines, \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, \u00e0 l\u2019intention de deux autres gestionnaires de l\u2019ACDI, Joanne Nolan et Michael Collins. Elle a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nPour ce qui est des prochaines \u00e9tapes\u2026, il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le m\u00e9dical pour tout agent que vous pr\u00e9voyez envoyer en Afghanistan en vue d\u2019une affectation temporaire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e quelconque. La pr\u00e9sente note fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la situation avec le MDN \u00e0 Kandahar... mais nous devrions simplement le faire de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour Kaboul aussi. Je dois \u00e9crire une r\u00e9ponse au Major Thurlow; pourriez-vous m\u2019appeler pour que nous puissions discuter de la rigueur du processus que nous allons maintenant mettre en place?\n[105] Selon la preuve et ce courriel, je conclus que l\u2019ACDI a pris une part active dans les changements que l\u2019on a finalement int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan et qui ont servi \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la plaignante. Je conclus \u00e9galement qu\u2019il ressort de la preuve que m\u00eame si l\u2019ACDI soutient qu\u2019elle ne fait que suivre les recommandations de SC, qu\u2019elle ne participe pas au processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas l\u2019expertise voulue pour faire plus que suivre les directives de SC, elle exerce nettement plus d\u2019influence dans tout le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation que ce qu\u2019elle a dit.\n[106] Pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019une norme est \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb, il incombe \u00e0 un employeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a pris en consid\u00e9ration toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne peut r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9 en question sans subir une contrainte excessive (voir Meiorin, au paragraphe 62, ainsi que l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, au paragraphe 32 (Grismer)). L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas soumis de preuve qu\u2019elle a analys\u00e9 toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande. M\u00eame si l\u2019ACDI a discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9liminer les exigences en mati\u00e8re de voyage de son poste, cela ne r\u00e9pondait pas au besoin qu\u2019avait la plaignante d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience de terrain op\u00e9rationnelle qui lui permettrait d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019avancement sur le plan professionnel. Quand la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir une liste de pays o\u00f9 elle pourrait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, il a fallu plus de deux mois \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI pour d\u00e9cider que SC se chargerait de cette d\u00e9cision. Il a fallu deux autres mois avant que SC d\u00e9cide que l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u assez d\u2019informations au sujet de six des 19 pays retenus, et qu\u2019un addenda serait produit apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les informations n\u00e9cessaires. SC n\u2019a jamais fourni l\u2019addenda et l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a rien fait pour veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 cette demande. L\u2019ACDI \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le fait d\u2019offrir les choix susmentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e9tait une mesure d\u2019accommodement, car, dit-elle, cela ne faisait pas partie de sa pratique habituelle. Cependant, on ne s\u2019acquitte pas de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement en allant simplement au-del\u00e0 des pratiques habituelles. On le fait en analysant toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables, \u00e0 la condition de n\u2019imposer aucune contrainte excessive, comme il est dit dans les arr\u00eats Meorin et Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s.\n[107] L\u2019\u00e9valuation que l\u2019ACDI a faite des mesures d\u2019accommodement reposait, presque exclusivement, sur les informations \u00e9manant de SC, car l\u2019ACDI ne poss\u00e8de pas l\u2019expertise voulue sur le plan m\u00e9dical pour ses employ\u00e9s. M\u00eame si l\u2019ACDI a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas suivre une recommandation m\u00e9dicale de SC, il ressort de la preuve que l\u2019ACDI conteste rarement ces recommandations. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la recommandation m\u00e9dicale de SC est un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019ACDI de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan. De plus, le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC est directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse des mesures d\u2019accommodement de l\u2019ACDI. Cependant, SC n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI toutes les informations dont il s\u2019est servi dans le cadre du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation, y compris les renseignements concernant [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 actuel, le pronostic de r\u00e9tablissement, l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches professionnelles et la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter un travail de substitution \u00bb (Lane, au paragraphe 107). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, conform\u00e9ment au libell\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, le caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante, y compris ses \u00ab [\u2026] capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes \u00bb n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration (Meiorin, au paragraphe 62). L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un autre avis m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant et n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante pour que l\u2019ACDI exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas suivre la recommandation de SC. Par contre, si l\u2019ACDI n\u2019est pas form\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d\u2019une personne, comment va\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e9tablir \u00e0 quel moment ne pas suivre une recommandation de SC? Va-t-elle devoir cr\u00e9er un autre comit\u00e9 d\u2019experts pour valider les recommandations de SC? Si l\u2019ACDI d\u00e9cide de ne pas suivre les recommandations, quelles sont les cons\u00e9quences s\u2019il survient un autre incident, en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit l\u2019obligation de diligence qu\u2019a l\u2019employeur envers ses employ\u00e9s?\n[108] Par ailleurs, je conclus que l\u2019ACDI a tent\u00e9 de faciliter la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 certaines des questions de cette derni\u00e8re sur les affectations disponibles et leurs exigences. Il ressort de la preuve que lorsqu\u2019ils pr\u00e9sentent leur candidature en vue d\u2019une affectation, les employ\u00e9s classent les pays par ordre de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence et qu\u2019ils inscrivent souvent un deuxi\u00e8me et un troisi\u00e8me choix. L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, de veiller \u00e0 ce que la plaignante obtienne son deuxi\u00e8me ou son troisi\u00e8me choix d\u2019affectation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Bien qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 ne puisse s\u2019attendre \u00e0 obtenir une solution parfaite dans le cadre du processus d\u2019accommodement (voir Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, 2007 1 RCS 161, au paragraphe 22), l\u2019ACDI avait pour pratique d\u2019utiliser le plan de carri\u00e8re d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Michael Collins, gestionnaire au sein du Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, a \u00e9crit ce qui suit dans un courriel non dat\u00e9, adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son \u00e9quipe :\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sent courriel a pour but de reconna\u00eetre officiellement que nous avons re\u00e7u votre demande ou sommes au courant de votre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019affectations \u00e0 venir en Afghanistan. Notre intention est d\u2019examiner cet int\u00e9r\u00eat en priorit\u00e9. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, nous pr\u00e9voyons organiser des r\u00e9unions (ou faire un suivi par \u00e9crit pour les personnes se trouvant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger) avec chacun d\u2019entre vous individuellement (p. ex., avec Steve Hallihan) au cours des prochains jours afin d\u2019approfondir votre int\u00e9r\u00eat, sur le plan du lieu, des dates, etc., et aussi d\u2019examiner la situation dans le contexte de vos int\u00e9r\u00eats professionnels g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et de votre orientation au sein du GTA. Plus de nouvelles sur le sujet sous peu.\n[109] M\u00eame si la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019un certain nombre de r\u00e9unions ont eu lieu et que certains efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour aider le plan de carri\u00e8re de la plaignante, celle-ci a re\u00e7u un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui de ses pairs \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan et a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule de son groupe que l\u2019on a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une affectation dans ce pays. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 y aller \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience et, par-dessus tout, \u00e0 cause de la fa\u00e7on dont la norme figurant dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e. L\u2019ACDI a fait des efforts pour prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante, mais ne lui a offert aucune solution de rechange autre que celle de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature en vue d\u2019autres affectations et d\u2019un poste au sein du Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e0 Ottawa, sans exigence de voyage.\n[110] La plaignante \u00e9tait tenue de collaborer au processus d\u2019accommodement. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019ACDI a fait valoir que la plaignante avait envoy\u00e9 des messages contradictoires et n\u2019avait pas suffisamment collabor\u00e9 au processus d\u2019accommodement. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019ACDI a mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bl\u00e2m\u00e9e pour certaines des mesures qu\u2019elle avait prises en rapport avec sa situation \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI. Je conclus que la plaignante a bel et bien collabor\u00e9 au processus d\u2019accommodement, m\u00eame si certaines de ses mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es inappropri\u00e9es.\n[111] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, l\u2019ACDI ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation proc\u00e9durale de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante. Cela \u00e9tant, l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas fourni de motif justifiable pour ses actes discriminatoires au regard des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, sur le fondement de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante, je conclus que l\u2019ACDI a soumis la plaignante \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi et a poursuivi une pratique qui a priv\u00e9 la plaignante d\u2019une occasion d\u2019emploi.\niii. La prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan constituerait une contrainte excessive [112] La preuve a clairement \u00e9tabli le contexte singulier dans lequel se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les faits qui ont men\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes devant le Tribunal. Ce contexte singulier invalide-t-il l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive? La Commission a fait valoir qu\u2019il serait erron\u00e9 en droit de ne pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une telle analyse. Je suis du m\u00eame avis. L\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive doit \u00eatre faite m\u00eame dans une zone de guerre. Il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas toujours possible de prendre de telles mesures dans une zone de guerre \u00e0 cause des conditions singuli\u00e8res de la guerre qui pourraient causer une contrainte excessive; cependant, je r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019une approche individualis\u00e9e, au cas par cas, est importante, car une norme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e pourrait cr\u00e9er des injustices si l\u2019on ne tient pas compte des caract\u00e9ristiques individuelles dans le cadre du processus suivi.\n[113] M\u00eame si l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle a pris en consid\u00e9ration toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, j\u2019examinerai si le fait que l\u2019ACDI prenne de telles mesures en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan lui imposerait une contrainte excessive. Il est n\u00e9cessaire selon moi de faire cette analyse, parce que les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019importantes observations sur ce point et que cette d\u00e9termination est li\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines des mesures de redressement que la plaignante souhaite obtenir.\n[114] J\u2019ai conclu plus t\u00f4t que le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019effet des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ont eu pour r\u00e9sultat que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au moment d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e sur le plan m\u00e9dical en vue d\u2019une affectation professionnelle en Afghanistan. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement conclu que SC s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan pour formuler sa recommandation \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI au sujet de l\u2019aptitude de la plaignante sur le plan m\u00e9dical \u00e0 recevoir une affectation en Afghanistan et que l\u2019ACDI s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur la recommandation de SC et les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan pour d\u00e9cider en fin de compte de ne pas affecter la plaignante en Afghanistan. Le 11 janvier 2010, Bob Johnston, de l\u2019ACDI, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante une lettre, qui figure dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, pour l\u2019informer que, vu la recommandation de SC, son affectation ne serait plus prise en consid\u00e9ration. Cette lettre indique :\n[traduction]\nSC a confirm\u00e9 que le sp\u00e9cialiste en m\u00e9decine ind\u00e9pendant a conclu que vous \u00ab n\u2019avez pas satisfait aux exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues du GEST \u00bb. SC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de plus que la conclusion que le sp\u00e9cialiste en m\u00e9decine ind\u00e9pendant a tir\u00e9e est \u00ab compatible avec celles qu\u2019a tir\u00e9es le m\u00e9decin \u00e9valuateur initial \u00bb.\nLa position et la conduite de l\u2019ACDI dans cette affaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et demeurent coh\u00e9rentes avec le cadre technique proc\u00e9dural et de principe applicable et existant. De plus, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de l\u2019ACDI sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales pour 2010, SC a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune nouvelle \u00e9valuation n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[115] Bob Johnston conclut sa lettre \u00e0 la plaignante en soulignant que la conduite de l\u2019ACDI correspondait au cadre proc\u00e9dural et de principe en vigueur. Je conclus que cela confirme l\u2019effet qu\u2019ont eu les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante ainsi que sur la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ACDI de ne pas affecter cette derni\u00e8re en Afghanistan. La lettre expliquait aussi que le Dr Beauregard \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que les autres m\u00e9decins qui l\u2019avaient \u00e9valu\u00e9e, mais uniquement sous l\u2019angle des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb.\n[116] Cela \u00e9tant dit, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de fonder mon analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une contrainte excessive dans les mesures d\u2019accommodement qui auraient pu \u00eatre prises en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan sur le troisi\u00e8me avis m\u00e9dical (l\u2019\u00e9valuation du Dr Beauregard), en faisant abstraction de sa conclusion concernant les \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb. Le CCM\u2011SC \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 se fier au troisi\u00e8me avis m\u00e9dical mais, pour des raisons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9es, il a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Sans l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, les conditions et les recommandations que le Dr Beauregard a formul\u00e9es sont les mesures d\u2019accommodement que l\u2019ACDI aurait d\u00fb prendre en consid\u00e9ration au moment de d\u00e9cider si la plaignante pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. Pour que la plaignante puisse \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan, le Dr Beauregard a recommand\u00e9 les conditions suivantes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 obtenir un degr\u00e9 de risque acceptable pour la plaignante en Afghanistan.\n[traduction]\nAcc\u00e8s en tout temps \u00e0 ses m\u00e9dicaments, \u00e0 son mat\u00e9riel de contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 ses fournitures de r\u00e9serve afin qu\u2019elle puisse contr\u00f4ler souvent, pendant toute la journ\u00e9e, son propre \u00e9tat.\nVivre et dormir dans une pi\u00e8ce avec une autre personne qui est au courant de son \u00e9tat pour plus de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nLors de ses d\u00e9placements, s\u2019organiser pour avoir avec elle des r\u00e9serves suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019aliments et d\u2019insuline.\n[117] J\u2019ai en main suffisamment de preuves pour conclure que l\u2019ACDI a envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de mettre en \u0153uvre ces conditions et est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible. La preuve fait \u00e9tat des risques s\u00e9rieux que court la plaignante sur le plan de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en travaillant en Afghanistan, ainsi que les risques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que courent les personnes combattant en Afghanistan s\u2019il faut qu\u2019elles portent assistance \u00e0 la plaignante. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que, pour l\u2019ACDI, le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan constituerait une contrainte excessive.\nLes risques pour la sant\u00e9\n[118] Les agents de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019ACDI qui sont affect\u00e9s en Afghanistan contribuent de diverses fa\u00e7ons au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et politique de ce pays. Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode en cause, ces agents pouvaient \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul, au KAF ou aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019EPR \u00e0 Kandahar. M. Johnston a d\u00e9crit les fonctions qu\u2019ils ex\u00e9cutaient \u00e0 ces trois endroits. \u00c0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul, les responsabilit\u00e9s comprenaient le fait d\u2019assurer une liaison \u00e9troite avec les services gouvernementaux afghans, de contribuer des ressources pour les programmes administr\u00e9s par des organismes internationaux ou non gouvernementaux et de se d\u00e9placer fr\u00e9quemment dans Kaboul. Au sein de l\u2019EPR, o\u00f9 \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s la majorit\u00e9 des agents de l\u2019ACDI, les agents de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s de g\u00e9rer un portefeuille de divers projets et initiatives. L\u2019aide canadienne totalisait une somme d\u2019environ 10 millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e, r\u00e9partie entre une vingtaine de projets, et chaque agent assumait la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un nombre maximal de quatre ou cinq projets. Comme \u00e0 Kaboul, les agents de d\u00e9veloppement devaient se d\u00e9placer pour rencontrer des partenaires et visiter et surveiller des sites de projet. L\u2019ACDI n\u2019affectait pas de nombreux agents au KAF. Les fonctions qu\u2019ils y ex\u00e9cutaient avaient principalement trait \u00e0 la coordination avec les militaires. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Bob Johnston a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLeur r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 garantir qu\u2019il [le commandant] tenait compte de la dimension \u00ab d\u00e9veloppement \u00bb. Au KAF, les activit\u00e9s quotidiennes comprenaient des r\u00e9unions tenues sur place mais, quand le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou le RCK \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s \u00e0 Shura, ou faisaient une visite des sites, on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils les accompagnent; il arrivait parfois qu\u2019ils sortent par eux-m\u00eames, pour accompagner un groupe qui s\u2019occupait d\u2019un probl\u00e8me mettant en cause des biens civils ou militaires.\n[119] Les Dres Callary et Baxter se sont rendus en Afghanistan pour visiter les diff\u00e9rents endroits o\u00f9 travaillaient les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI, sauf un : l\u2019EPR. \u00c0 cause d\u2019une temp\u00eate de sable, ils n\u2019ont pas pu se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019EPR. S\u2019il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 que la plaignante subisse une blessure et doive \u00eatre \u00e9vacu\u00e9e, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus \u00e0 risque que les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, et le risque aurait empir\u00e9 dans une situation telle qu\u2019une temp\u00eate de sable, qui pouvait limiter son \u00e9vacuation. Les m\u00e9decins ont tenu compte de ce fait dans leur analyse. Les Dres Callary et Baxter ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et produit un rapport \u00e9crit au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan. Elles ont fait \u00e9tat des facteurs de stress locaux \u00e0 Kaboul, au KAF et aux installations de l\u2019EPR, et elles ont \u00e9crit dans le rapport que ces facteurs comprenaient [traduction] \u00ab la fatigue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale due aux longues heures de travail, les niveaux de bruit et les difficult\u00e9s de sommeil, l\u2019exigu\u00eft\u00e9 des logements, de m\u00eame que l\u2019absence de libert\u00e9 de d\u00e9placement et les dangers que pr\u00e9sentent les auteurs d\u2019attentats-suicides lors des d\u00e9placements \u00bb. \u00c0 leur avis, et de l\u2019avis aussi de l\u2019ACDI, il \u00e9tait difficile de faire en sorte que la plaignante travaille \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sans aucune exigence de d\u00e9placement parce que cela voulait dire que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s auraient \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer davantage pour compenser, ce qui les exposerait davantage aux dangers pr\u00e9sents dans le secteur. Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 ensemble tous les facteurs, les m\u00e9decins ont conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan car cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019exposerait \u00e0 un stress accru, \u00e0 des infections et \u00e0 des risques de blessure qui requi\u00e8rent plus d\u2019attention m\u00e9dicale si la personne souffre du diab\u00e8te de type 1.\n[120] Le Tribunal a aussi entendu le t\u00e9moignage du Dr John Dupr\u00e9, sp\u00e9cialiste en endocrinologie, pour le compte des intim\u00e9s. Le Dr Dupr\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que, dans le cas de la plaignante, on ne peut pas \u00e9liminer enti\u00e8rement le risque d\u2019un incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des incidents hypoglyc\u00e9miques graves, comme celui qu\u2019a subi la plaignante en 2008, peuvent se reproduire et qu\u2019ils s\u2019aggravent suivant l\u2019\u00e2ge et la fr\u00e9quence des incidents hypoglyc\u00e9miques. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 toutes les preuves m\u00e9dicales disponibles au sujet de la plaignante et de la situation en Afghanistan, le Dr Dupr\u00e9 a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la plaignante repr\u00e9sentait un risque pour elle-m\u00eame et pour d\u2019autres et n\u2019a dit entrevoir aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement. Dans son rapport concernant le risque d\u2019un grave incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique, il a \u00e9crit que, dans le cas de la plaignante, un tel risque \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable.\n[121] Dans son rapport, le Dr Beauregard a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab [j]\u2019ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan, \u00e0 la condition d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de la nourriture, \u00e0 de l\u2019insuline et au mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire pour administrer l\u2019insuline et surveiller le taux de glucose dans le sang. J\u2019ai reconnu toutefois que si elle \u00e9tait prise en otage, elle courrait un plus grand risque de mourir si elle \u00e9tait priv\u00e9e de nourriture ou d\u2019insuline. Le fait de vivre et de travailler dans des conditions difficiles impose des difficult\u00e9s additionnelles \u00e0 une personne souffrant du diab\u00e8te de type 1, mais j\u2019ai \u00e9valu\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les qualifications et la motivation de Mme Cruden sur le plan de la gestion du diab\u00e8te, elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e pour une affectation en Afghanistan, mais \u00e0 la condition seulement de pouvoir disposer du mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] Selon le Dr Beauregard, il y avait un risque [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9el \u00bb que la plaignante soit victime d\u2019un incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique grave. La Dre Arnaout a not\u00e9 que le risque d\u2019un incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable. Je conclus que les risques que la plaignante soit victime d\u2019un autre incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique grave sont pr\u00e9sents et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9s.\n[122] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement entendu le Colonel Ricard et le Major Thurlow. Les deux poss\u00e9daient une bonne connaissance et une bonne expertise de l\u2019Afghanistan et du contexte de la zone de guerre dans ce pays, et ils ont d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail le fonctionnement, les emplacements et les objectifs des installations m\u00e9dicales pr\u00e9sentes en Afghanistan. Les deux t\u00e9moins ne se sont pas contredits et j\u2019ai conclu que leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible. Dans l\u2019ensemble, il ressort de ces t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019en Afghanistan, les installations m\u00e9dicales sont restreintes et fonctionnent \u00e0 plein rendement.\n[123] Les militaires classent les installations m\u00e9dicales en quatre cat\u00e9gories, depuis le R\u00f4le 1 jusqu\u2019au R\u00f4le 4, le R\u00f4le 1 \u00e9tant le moins fonctionnel et le R\u00f4le 4 le plus fonctionnel. En Afghanistan, l\u2019installation la plus fonctionnelle qu\u2019exploitaient les Canadiens \u2013 aujourd\u2019hui prise en charge par les Am\u00e9ricains \u2013 \u00e9tait l\u2019installation de R\u00f4le 3 situ\u00e9e au KAF. Il n\u2019existe aucune installation de R\u00f4le 4 en Afghanistan. Une personne qui aurait besoin d\u2019une installation de R\u00f4le 4 serait \u00e9vacu\u00e9e vers l\u2019Allemagne ou le Canada si elle \u00e9tait suffisamment stable pour voyager.\n[124] \u00c0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul, il n\u2019existe aucune installation m\u00e9dicale canadienne. De plus, il n\u2019y a pas de services d\u2019ambulance ou d\u2019appels d\u2019urgence de type 911. Dans n\u2019importe quelle situation d\u2019urgence, un patient doit \u00eatre transport\u00e9 dans un v\u00e9hicule blind\u00e9. Il est possible aussi que le voyage soit retard\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d\u2019un conflit. Les h\u00f4pitaux afghans sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme trop dangereux pour les ressortissants occidentaux. Dans les environs de Kaboul, il existe deux bases militaires de l\u2019OTAN dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations m\u00e9dicales. Il y a une installation de R\u00f4le 1 au Camp Souter, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 20 minutes de distance de l\u2019ambassade. La seule installation de R\u00f4le 3 se trouve au Camp Warehouse, une base de l\u2019OTAN fran\u00e7aise, \u00e0 10 kilom\u00e8tres \u00e0 l\u2019est de Kaboul. La route menant du Camp Souter au Camp Warehouse est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme dangereuse, et exige, pour le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un seul malade, le soutien complet de huit militaires. Le Camp Warehouse fournira des services m\u00e9dicaux \u00ab in extremis \u00bb si l\u2019intervention n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9judiciable au soutien m\u00e9dical du personnel de la FIAS. Enfin, pour pouvoir entrer sur la base, il faut d\u00e9tenir un laissez-passer de la FIAS. Sans un tel laissez-passer, l\u2019entr\u00e9e d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule peut \u00eatre refus\u00e9e ou longuement retard\u00e9e.\n[125] Tant le KAF que l\u2019EPR sont dot\u00e9es d\u2019une installation de R\u00f4le 1 et d\u2019une installation de R\u00f4le 3. \u00c0 ces deux endroits, l\u2019installation de R\u00f4le 1 est en mesure de traiter les patients ayant besoin d\u2019une intervention mineure. Cette installation n\u2019est pas dot\u00e9e d\u2019un laboratoire ou d\u2019un appareil de radiographie, et la pharmacie ne poss\u00e8de pas un stock complet de m\u00e9dicaments. Les heures d\u2019ouverture sont de 7 h 30 \u00e0 16 h 30. Une installation de R\u00f4le 1 est dot\u00e9e d\u2019un m\u00e9decin militaire et d\u2019un adjoint et ressemble, comme on l\u2019a d\u00e9crite, \u00e0 un cabinet de m\u00e9decine familiale. Le m\u00e9decin militaire joue le m\u00eame r\u00f4le qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin de famille ou un g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste. L\u2019adjoint est comme un prolongement du m\u00e9decin militaire, et son r\u00f4le est celui d\u2019une infirmi\u00e8re ou d\u2019un infirmier praticien ax\u00e9 sur les traumatismes plut\u00f4t que sur les maladies. Tant le m\u00e9decin militaire que l\u2019adjoint se remplacent mutuellement quand l\u2019un des deux est absent pour une \u00ab situation r\u00e9elle \u00bb. Une installation de R\u00f4le 1 ne sert qu\u2019\u00e0 des fins de triage et, de ce fait, n\u2019est pas dot\u00e9e de lits.\n[126] Une installation de R\u00f4le 2 est elle aussi d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 restreinte. Un patient peut y rester pendant une p\u00e9riode de quelques heures \u00e0 quelques jours. Dans un tel endroit, seules sont pratiqu\u00e9es des interventions chirurgicales de sauvetage visant \u00e0 stabiliser le patient. Pour une intervention chirurgicale plus pouss\u00e9e, ce dernier doit \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 une installation de R\u00f4le 3.\n[127] \u00c0 l\u2019EPR, l\u2019installation de R\u00f4le 3 \u00e9tait une installation dirig\u00e9e par les Canadiens, mais il s\u2019agit de par sa nature d\u2019une installation multinationale. Des repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019autres pays s\u2019y trouvent parfois, mais ce sont principalement des Canadiens et des Am\u00e9ricains qui y sont affect\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une installation plus ou moins improvis\u00e9e, \u00e0 laquelle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont ajout\u00e9s. Cent soixante personnes y travaillent. On y trouve 6 lits d\u2019unit\u00e9 de soins intensifs (USI), 6 lits de triage, 12 lits tampon et 3 salles d\u2019op\u00e9ration. Les goulots d\u2019\u00e9tranglement sont les lits de triage et d\u2019USI.\n[128] Au KAF, l\u2019installation de R\u00f4le 3 est dot\u00e9e de deux \u00e9quipes chirurgicales, d\u2019un chirurgien orthop\u00e9diste, d\u2019un psychiatre et d\u2019un interniste. Elle compte 12 lits ordinaires et 4 lits d\u2019USI, soit 16 lits en tout, tous dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce. Le Colonel Ricard, (premier m\u00e9decin-chef de la Force op\u00e9rationnelle servant au KAF) a qualifi\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019installation de [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s restreinte \u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les 16 lits sont occup\u00e9s dans une proportion de 80 % \u00e0 90 % en tout temps. \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2009, les Am\u00e9ricains ont pris le commandement de l\u2019installation. Le KAF est aujourd\u2019hui une structure moderne, qui comporte un h\u00f4pital ax\u00e9 sur les traumatismes, mais qui peut s\u2019occuper des maladies en cas de besoin. Le KAF compte aujourd\u2019hui 12 lits d\u2019USI et 12 lits de triage, ce qui en augmente la capacit\u00e9.\n[129] Le Colonel Ricard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la charge de travail des m\u00e9decins militaires du KAF est extr\u00eamement charg\u00e9e et, tous les jours, ils pratiquent en moyenne trois interventions chirurgicales traumatologiques importantes. Les m\u00e9decins de l\u2019installation travaillent \u00e0 un rythme intensif qui ne peut pas \u00eatre soutenu pendant plus de six mois. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Colonel Ricard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ceci :\n[traduction]\nEn tant que commandant, vous voyez donc votre effectif, bien entra\u00een\u00e9 et d\u00e9vou\u00e9, se fatiguer de plus en plus. Et, selon moi, nous pressons ces personnes comme des citrons pendant les six mois o\u00f9 elles sont l\u00e0; il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule p\u00e9riode de vacances de trois semaines durant ces six mois. Nous les \u00e9puisons compl\u00e8tement et ensuite nous les envoyons au pays pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer, mais nous ne pourrions pas faire cela pendant un an, deux ans, trois ans de travail \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Civic d\u2019Ottawa dans le cadre de mon travail ordinaire, vu l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de ce qui se passe l\u00e0-bas.\n[130] Le Major Thurlow \u00e9tait l\u2019officier de quart au Centre d\u2019op\u00e9rations interarm\u00e9es du KAF. \u00c0 ce titre, il avait pour t\u00e2che de r\u00e9pondre aux appels d\u2019urgence m\u00e9dicale et aidait \u00e0 trouver la fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9vacuer une victime. Dans le cadre de ce travail, il poss\u00e9dait des informations r\u00e9centes sur l\u2019\u00e9tat des lits dans toutes les installations hospitali\u00e8res pr\u00e9sentes dans sa zone d\u2019op\u00e9rations. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet des codes hospitaliers indiquant le degr\u00e9 d\u2019occupation d\u2019une installation :\n[traduction]\nUn code couleur d\u00e9termine la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019admettre des patients. Et, au Centre d\u2019op\u00e9rations interarm\u00e9es, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une chose que l\u2019on suit de minute en minute. Le code vert signifie qu\u2019une installation est en mesure d\u2019accepter des victimes, sans restriction. Le code jaune signifie qu\u2019une installation a atteint 75 % de sa capacit\u00e9. Il pourrait s\u2019agir de lits d\u2019USI, de lits de triage, de lits de guerre. Le code rouge indique que l\u2019h\u00f4pital est occup\u00e9 \u00e0 90 %. Enfin, il y a la couleur noire. Elle signifie 100 %, ce qui veut dire que l\u2019on a atteint le maximum; l\u2019installation ne peut plus recevoir d\u2019autres victimes.\n[131] Le Major Thurlow a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au KAF l\u2019installation de R\u00f4le 3 \u00e9tait souvent aux prises avec des sc\u00e9narios de code rouge ou noir. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le degr\u00e9 d\u2019occupation de l\u2019h\u00f4pital se r\u00e9percutait \u00e0 la fois sur les op\u00e9rations militaires et sur les traitements m\u00e9dicaux. Il se pouvait qu\u2019un commandant suspende une op\u00e9ration militaire s\u2019il apprenait qu\u2019une installation avait atteint le stade rouge et ne pourrait pas traiter de victimes. Un code rouge ou noir signifie aussi que les militaires d\u00e9terminent l\u2019ordre de priorit\u00e9 des victimes qui recevront des soins. Dans ce contexte, les h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res de l\u2019OTAN priorisaient les \u00e9vacuations en fonction du r\u00f4le et de la nationalit\u00e9 de la victime et donnaient la priorit\u00e9 aux forces de coalition, aux ressortissants occidentaux, etc.\n[132] Les patients sont cat\u00e9goris\u00e9s en fonction de leur type de blessure, soit A, B ou C. Un patient de cat\u00e9gorie A doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 dans l\u2019heure qui suit, une p\u00e9riode qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab l\u2019heure d\u2019or \u00bb. Un patient de cat\u00e9gorie A a priorit\u00e9 sur tous les autres. Son \u00e9tat est urgent et l\u2019on recourt aux moyens les plus exp\u00e9ditifs pour le soigner. Ce patient est toujours transport\u00e9 par la voie des airs. Dans le cas d\u2019un patient de cat\u00e9gorie B, la fen\u00eatre dans laquelle il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019intervenir s\u2019\u00e9tend jusqu\u2019\u00e0 4 heures et une fois son \u00e9tat stabilis\u00e9, il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 ailleurs. Le patient de cat\u00e9gorie B a une blessure qui met sa vie en p\u00e9ril, mais le risque est moins grave que dans le cas d\u2019un patient de cat\u00e9gorie A. Le patient de cat\u00e9gorie C est un patient ordinaire et il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de 24 heures.\n[133] En Afghanistan il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019ambulances ou de service 911. Lorsqu\u2019il survient une situation d\u2019urgence m\u00e9dicale, il y a plut\u00f4t une limite aux soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019il est possible de prodiguer sur place, comme c\u2019est le cas, par exemple, \u00e0 l\u2019EPR. Si la situation est une cat\u00e9gorie A ou B, une mission d\u2019\u00e9vacuation m\u00e9dicale est n\u00e9cessaire et les soins ne seront pas donn\u00e9s sur place; il faut d\u00e9placer la personne \u00e0 un autre endroit, ce qui pr\u00e9sente des risques additionnels pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la victime et celle des fournisseurs de soins et des militaires. Selon la preuve, lorsqu\u2019une personne souffrant du diab\u00e8te de type 1 est touch\u00e9e par une balle, cela repr\u00e9sente des risques accrus pour sa sant\u00e9. Les risques d\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9 ou touch\u00e9 par une balle, m\u00eame dans l\u2019EPR, \u00e9taient, a-t-on dit, [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9els, et non pas minces \u00bb.\nLes risques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9\n[134] Outre les pr\u00e9occupations pour la sant\u00e9, les employ\u00e9s civils travaillant en Afghanistan vivent sous la menace constante d\u2019une attaque. Les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI affect\u00e9s dans ce pays touchent une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration additionnelle appel\u00e9e \u00ab indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s \u00bb en reconnaissance des dangers inh\u00e9rents au fait de travailler dans une zone de guerre et des conditions de vie difficiles qu\u2019entra\u00eene la mission. Aux trois endroits o\u00f9 travaillent des agents de l\u2019ACDI \u2013 le KAF, Kaboul et le complexe de l\u2019EPR \u2013 les conditions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es de tr\u00e8s dangereuses.\n[135] Le Major Thurlow a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le KAF est bombard\u00e9 assez r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et de mani\u00e8re constante. Le Colonel Ricard a \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin-chef de la Force op\u00e9rationnelle au KAF pendant neuf mois et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le KAF a essuy\u00e9 durant ce temps 70 attaques \u00e0 la roquette. Au moment de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Major Thurlow a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le KAF avait subi r\u00e9cemment une attaque \u00e0 la roquette qui avait touch\u00e9 les installations de repas, blessant plusieurs personnes et tuant une autre. En contre-interrogatoire, le Colonel Ricard a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord \u00e0 l\u2019avocate de la plaignante, qui laissait entendre que les risques de blessures au KAF \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s faibles \u00bb : [traduction] \u00ab les risques de se blesser \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame du KAF sont r\u00e9els \u2013 pas tr\u00e8s faibles. [\u2026] Au KAF, les risques de mort sont s\u00e9rieux \u2013 chacun doit avoir \u00e0 sa disposition une veste pare-\u00e9clats et un casque \u00bb.\n[136] Bob Johnston a d\u00e9crit l\u2019aggravation des conditions dangereuses \u00e0 Kaboul au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2008. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, un h\u00f4tel que fr\u00e9quentaient des ressortissants \u00e9trangers avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une br\u00e8che de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Cet \u00e9tablissement \u00e9tait auparavant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme [traduction] \u00ab s\u00fbr \u00bb. Cette br\u00e8che de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie du premier des attentats \u00e0 la bombe contre l\u2019ambassade de l\u2019Inde, un incident dans lequel on avait fait sauter des v\u00e9hicules bourr\u00e9s d\u2019engrais. On avait retrouv\u00e9 des restes humains \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame de l\u2019ambassade du Canada, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 un demi-mille de distance. Selon M. Johnston, les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada \u00e0 Kaboul sont les plus co\u00fbteuses qui soient, comparativement \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle autre ambassade du Canada ailleurs dans le monde. Apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019ambassade a retenu les services d\u2019une entreprise de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comptant \u00e0 la fois du personnel afghan et d\u2019anciens membres des Forces sp\u00e9ciales britanniques. Les agents de l\u2019ACDI qui assistaient \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada y \u00e9taient conduits par un chauffeur arm\u00e9, dans un v\u00e9hicule blind\u00e9. En 2009, l\u2019ambassade a instaur\u00e9 des protocoles de [traduction] \u00ab protection rapproch\u00e9e \u00bb dans le cadre desquels les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient accompagn\u00e9s par les anciens membres des Forces sp\u00e9ciales britanniques jusqu\u2019aux r\u00e9unions afin d\u2019aider \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les mesures d\u2019extraction en cas d\u2019attentat \u00e0 la bombe suicidaire, souvent suivi de tir d\u2019armes.\n[137] Le complexe qu\u2019occupe l\u2019EPR est lui aussi sous la menace d\u2019une attaque. Les Dres Callary et Baxter ont signal\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab des \u00e9changes de coup de feu ont lieu \u00e0 une distance de 300 \u00e0 400 m\u00e8tres des murs du complexe, ce qui oblige les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 rester dans des abris fortifi\u00e9s \u00bb. Bob Johnston a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2009, toutes les personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans les installations de l\u2019EPR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vacu\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de la menace d\u2019une attaque d\u2019envergure.\n[138] La constante menace d\u2019une attaque a \u00e9galement une incidence sur les \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales. Ces derni\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre faites soit par v\u00e9hicule blind\u00e9 soit par h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re. Vu les dangers d\u2019un d\u00e9placement par v\u00e9hicule, la plupart des \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales se font par h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re. Le Major Thurlow, qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de surveiller les combats et d\u2019exp\u00e9dier des h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res pour sauver les victimes, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait 15 h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res \u2013 la plupart, sinon tous, Am\u00e9ricains \u2013 qui s\u2019occupaient de toutes les \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales dans la zone d\u2019op\u00e9rations connue sous le nom de Commandement r\u00e9gional (Sud), qui englobe cinq provinces du sud de l\u2019Afghanistan. En 2009, ces 15 h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res ont effectu\u00e9 5 300 \u00e9valuationsm\u00e9dicales et transport\u00e9 7 500 victimes. Ces chiffres n\u2019incluent pas les transferts de patients d\u2019une installation \u00e0 une autre, dont se chargent les 15 m\u00eames h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res. Il y avait en moyenne 16 \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales par jour, mais ce chiffre pouvait augmenter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 32 :\n[traduction]\nun jour, nous avons fait 32 missions d\u2019\u00e9vacuation m\u00e9dicale \u2013 et cela signifie que tout le monde travaille \u00e0 plein rendement \u2013 le personnel vole sans cesse d\u2019une mission \u00e0 une autre \u2013 les installations se remplissent et, ce jour-l\u00e0, nous avons d\u00fb refuser de prodiguer des soins.\n[139] Le Major Thurlow a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 des dangers que pr\u00e9sente l\u2019\u00e9vacuation des victimes en Afghanistan. Chaque mission n\u00e9cessite l\u2019utilisation de deux h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res, transportant chacun trois personnes \u00e0 son bord. L\u2019un des deux h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res se pose pendant que l\u2019autre le prot\u00e8ge. Selon le Major Thurlow :\n[traduction]\nIl faut donc deux h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res pour aller chercher la victime \u00e0 cause du risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9; le 2e h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re fait office de second h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9vacuation ou, si le secteur est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, il fait office d\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re d\u2019attaque. Mais les deux sont capables de se d\u00e9fendre eux-m\u00eames. Les deux iront chercher la victime. L\u2019un des deux se pose, l\u2019\u00e9quipe m\u00e9dicale, on compte environ 3 personnes par h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re. Ils descendent, \u00e9valuent l\u2019\u00e9tat de la victime, chargent la victime dans l\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re. L\u2019autre reste dans les airs et assure la protection de l\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re au sol, il repousse tout ennemi qui peut appara\u00eetre ou qui tente d\u2019intervenir dans la situation. Les mesures d\u2019interdiction sont fr\u00e9quentes \u2013 pas impr\u00e9vues. On tire sur ces h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res \u2013 on tire sur tous les h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res. Quand ils volent, on leur tire dessus. C\u2019est un travail dangereux.\n[140] Le Major Thurlow a ajout\u00e9 que les engins explosifs improvis\u00e9s (EEI) sont un autre danger auquel sont confront\u00e9s les militaires qui proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 une \u00e9vacuation m\u00e9dicale. \u00c0 une occasion, en revenant \u00e0 leur h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re apr\u00e8s avoir couch\u00e9 une victime sur une civi\u00e8re, deux brancardiers ont d\u00fb \u00eatre amput\u00e9s apr\u00e8s avoir mis le pied sur un tel engin.\nD\u2019autres questions relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9\n[141] Je consid\u00e8re aussi que les facteurs qui suivent sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019on \u00e9value la question de la contrainte excessive dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n1. La prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan et l\u2019effet que cela peut avoir sur le succ\u00e8s de la mission\n[142] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de toutes les autres missions de maintien de la paix ou \u00e0 caract\u00e8re politique de l\u2019ONU, le succ\u00e8s de la mission men\u00e9e en Afghanistan est optimal lorsqu\u2019il existe un bon climat de collaboration. Ce principe s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux missions de l\u2019ACDI. La prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement dans une zone de guerre a-t-elle un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la relation entre les divers intervenants qui se trouvent sur place? Il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le succ\u00e8s des missions de l\u2019ONU et d\u2019autres missions internationales, comme celle que m\u00e8ne l\u2019ACDI en Afghanistan, d\u00e9pendent de partenariats efficaces et de bonnes relations entre les militaires et les diff\u00e9rents intervenants. Plus cet effet est n\u00e9gatif, plus on se rapproche de la contrainte excessive, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019incidence que cela aura sur la mission et sur les personnes en cause. Les Forces canadiennes ne dictent pas au gouvernement canadien comment g\u00e9rer ses projets, mais, quand il est question de zones de combat, ces forces sont des sp\u00e9cialistes. Leur \u00e9valuation est indispensable quand il est question des conditions de vie dans la zone de combat et du degr\u00e9 de risque dans ces situations. Selon la preuve, les militaires sont charg\u00e9s de d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quelle installation m\u00e9dicale une victime sera envoy\u00e9e, ainsi que de planifier toutes les \u00e9vacuations et le moindre mouvement des civils canadiens entre les diff\u00e9rents camps et d\u2019autres parties du pays. Pour accomplir la mission avec succ\u00e8s, il est n\u00e9cessaire de collaborer avec les militaires et d\u2019entretenir avec eux de bonnes relations.\n[143] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les relations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perturb\u00e9es par l\u2019absence d\u2019un processus n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention des incidents m\u00e9dicaux, comme celui dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime la plaignante en 2008.\n[144] Au moment de l\u2019incident, Ron Shatz, directeur du D\u00e9veloppement au sein de l\u2019EPR \u00e0 Kandahar, a transmis un courriel \u00e0 MM. Hallihan et Metcalfe, du GTA, \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] l'incident a inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 ceux qui ont pris soin d\u2019elle. Aucun d\u2019entre nous ici n\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une rechute.\n[145] Tant la plaignante que les intim\u00e9s se sont fond\u00e9s dans leur t\u00e9moignage sur ce courriel de Ron Shatz :\n[traduction]\nCe matin, le personnel m\u00e9dical m\u2019a dit qu\u2019en aucun cas il ne l\u2019aurait laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019EPRK, qu\u2019elle faisait courir un risque aux autres; m\u00eame si je trouve cela un peu exag\u00e9r\u00e9, on a imm\u00e9diatement demand\u00e9 un h\u00e9lico et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vacu\u00e9e vers le KAF dans les 90 minutes suivantes. Il estime que ce type de trouble (son personnel m\u00e9dical lui a dit que B. se trouvait dans un \u00e9tat proche du coma diab\u00e9tique) est inacceptable ici et que si cet incident devait se produire dans une BOA il n\u2019y aurait aucune mesure de maintien des fonctions vitales, ce qui pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9sastreuses. Il a clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019accepterait pas B. ici, que l\u2019affectation soit de courte dur\u00e9e ou de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[146] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique que la plaignante a subi en 2008, les militaires, en consultation avec leur interniste, ont conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas avis\u00e9 de la part de l\u2019ACDI d\u2019envoyer des civils dans une zone de guerre sans v\u00e9rifier comme il faut si ces employ\u00e9s souffraient d\u2019une affection chronique qui risquait de mettre ces derniers, d\u2019autres personnes et la mission tout enti\u00e8re en p\u00e9ril. De ce fait, les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es et il ressort de la preuve que cela a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les relations avec les militaires. Ces derniers ne sont pas \u00e0 la t\u00eate des missions de l\u2019ACDI, mais ils ont certainement un mot \u00e0 dire sur la fa\u00e7on dont ils souhaitent agir quand ils mettent leurs soldats dans une situation \u00e0 risque. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019objet des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e9tait d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la collaboration et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 entre les divers partenaires participant \u00e0 la mission en Afghanistan. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les militaires et son employeur ont r\u00e9agi de mani\u00e8re excessive \u00e0 l\u2019incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en 2008. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Je conclus que la situation aurait pu \u00eatre nettement pire si personne n\u2019avait entendue la plaignante dans son sommeil ou si la base avait essuy\u00e9 une attaque au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante \u00e9tait frapp\u00e9e d\u2019incapacit\u00e9. Au vu de la preuve, une personne atteinte du diab\u00e8te de type 1 peut avoir besoin de l\u2019aide d\u2019une autre personne pour recevoir une injection de glucagon ou du glucose par voie intraveineuse en cas d\u2019incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique grave, sans quoi les cons\u00e9quences pourraient \u00eatre d\u00e9sastreuses. La plaignante a omis \u00e9galement de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les cons\u00e9quences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qu\u2019un autre incident hypoglyc\u00e9mique pourrait avoir sur sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sur celle d\u2019autres personnes, sans parler des r\u00e9percussions que cela pourrait avoir sur les relations entre l\u2019ACDI et les militaires et le succ\u00e8s de la mission en Afghanistan.\n2. Le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 sur le milieu ambiant\n[147] Plus il est possible d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur un milieu donn\u00e9, moins une EPJ et une contrainte excessive sont justifiables; moins on peut exercer un contr\u00f4le sur un milieu donn\u00e9, plus le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019EPJ jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive s\u2019applique.\n[148] Selon ce crit\u00e8re, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019analyser qui exerce le contr\u00f4le sur le milieu ambiant. Plus l\u2019employeur a une emprise sur ce milieu ainsi que sur les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019une mission, plus il devrait \u00eatre possible de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement sans imposer de contrainte excessive. Si l\u2019employeur est oblig\u00e9 de se fier \u00e0 des tiers pour ma\u00eetriser le milieu, il est n\u00e9cessaire de prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019effet que la situation peut avoir sur ces tiers dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse de la contrainte excessive. Les autres parties qui assurent le succ\u00e8s de la mission vont-elles soutenir les mesures d\u2019accommodement?\n[149] Dans une zone de guerre, le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 sur le milieu ambiant pr\u00e9sente un certain nombre de difficult\u00e9s; si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas, il n\u2019y aurait aucune victime civile parce que leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 serait assur\u00e9e. La preuve que nous avons vue plus t\u00f4t au sujet du contexte de la zone de guerre en Afghanistan \u00e9tablit que les dangers l\u00e0-bas sont r\u00e9els et que les vies sont constamment en p\u00e9ril. Dans ce contexte, il est indispensable de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les r\u00e9ponses aux questions suivantes :\nQuelles sont les cons\u00e9quences si l\u2019on applique les mesures d\u2019accommodement? D\u2019autres personnes seront-elles mises en danger \u00e0 cause de ces mesures? Quels en sont les effets sur les droits des autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI, les civils, les militaires, les installations, etc.?\n[150] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les mesures d\u2019accommodement obligent-elles d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 prendre, pour le compte de la plaignante, des mesures qui leur imposent une contrainte excessive? Est-il raisonnable, voire possible, pour un employeur de respecter par lui-m\u00eame les mesures d\u2019accommodement sans la collaboration de ses partenaires?\n[151] Le travail qu\u2019accomplit l\u2019ACDI en Afghanistan d\u00e9pend des militaires \u00e0 diverses fins et, surtout, \u00e0 des fins de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M\u00eame si l\u2019ACDI administre des projets civils en Afghanistan, les militaires participent directement aux aspects op\u00e9rationnels de ces missions et, dans les faits, certains y participent de si pr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils perdent la vie dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions.\n[152] Dans mon \u00e9valuation de la preuve relative \u00e0 la question de savoir qui exerce un contr\u00f4le sur le milieu ambiant ainsi que sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 assur\u00e9e dans la zone de guerre, j\u2019opte pour celle de l\u2019ACDI plut\u00f4t que pour celle de la plaignante. Quand cette derni\u00e8re a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, elle a tent\u00e9 d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les dangers en Afghanistan. En m\u00eame temps, elle r\u00e9clame l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de redressement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 ou enlev\u00e9. Je ne consid\u00e8re pas que cette preuve est pertinente, car un diplomate canadien a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 et d\u2019autres civils canadiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 blesses ou enlev\u00e9s en Afghanistan. Le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante sur cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincant. Il est ressorti de la preuve que l\u2019ACDI \u00e0 elle seule n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur le milieu en Afghanistan et d\u2019assurer \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 raisonnable. De plus, il est difficile, sinon impossible, pour les militaires de contr\u00f4ler la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du milieu en Afghanistan. Je conclus que l\u2019ACDI exerce un degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le tr\u00e8s faible sur le milieu de travail de la plaignante en Afghanistan. Je conclus \u00e9galement que les militaires exercent un certain degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le, mais qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas garantir un degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le total dans la zone de guerre en Afghanistan.\nLa conclusion au sujet de la contrainte excessive\n[153] La Commission a fait valoir qu\u2019il faudrait prendre en consid\u00e9ration les risques d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sents dans le milieu au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer si le fait de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante constituerait un degr\u00e9 de risque inacceptable. La Commission et la plaignante ont soutenu que tout civil affect\u00e9 en Afghanistan accepte un certain degr\u00e9 de risque, tout comme les militaires qui collaborent avec l\u2019ACDI. Cela est vrai, mais la question demeure : est-il sage d\u2019envisager d\u2019ajouter plus de risques \u00e0 un milieu d\u00e9j\u00e0 risqu\u00e9? Cette optique est-elle acceptable dans une zone de guerre?\n[154] La Commission a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Multani c. Commission scolaire Marguerite\u2011Bourgeoys, 2006 CSC 6 (Multani) \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position concernant les risques en cause. Dans l\u2019affaire Multani, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole publique du Qu\u00e9bec, au Canada, un pays pacifique o\u00f9 personne ne s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une roquette tombe sur le toit d\u2019une \u00e9cole. S\u2019il survient une situation d\u2019urgence, aucun insurg\u00e9 n\u2019emp\u00eachera les ambulanciers param\u00e9dicaux ou les policiers de venir rapidement \u00e0 l\u2019aide. En Afghanistan, le sc\u00e9nario est nettement diff\u00e9rent de celui dont il \u00e9tait question dans Multani. Cependant, je trouve que l\u2019arr\u00eat Multani est instructif en ce sens que chaque milieu est diff\u00e9rent et que le degr\u00e9 de risque qui y est pr\u00e9sent doit \u00eatre analys\u00e9 au cas par cas. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ceci :\nBien que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notre Cour n\u2019ait pas \u00e0 comparer le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 souhaitable dans un environnement donn\u00e9 avec celui du milieu scolaire, ces d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9montrent que chaque milieu est particulier et poss\u00e8de des caract\u00e9ristiques qui lui sont propres et qui justifieront un niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent selon les circonstances.\n(voir Multani, au paragraphe 66)\n[155] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, dans la d\u00e9cision Nijjar c. Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canada 3000 Limit\u00e9e (1999), 36 CHRR D\/76 (Nijjar), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nAfin de d\u00e9terminer si la politique de l'intim\u00e9e concernant les armes peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par mesure d'accommodement envers les Sikhs auxquels elle est pr\u00e9judiciable, il faut examiner le milieu dans lequel la r\u00e8gle doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous sommes convaincus qu'un avion repr\u00e9sente un milieu unique. Un certain nombre d'individus sont regroup\u00e9s et doivent demeurer ensemble, dans un espace clos, pendant une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e. Les services m\u00e9dicaux et la police ne sont pas facilement accessibles en cas d'urgence.\nLa Commission a fait remarquer que les avions renferment toute sorte d'objets (bouteilles de vin, b\u00e9quilles, cannes, etc.) qui sont admis \u00e0 bord et qui pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s comme armes. S'il est vrai que ces diff\u00e9rents types d'objets pourraient en th\u00e9orie \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s comme armes, nous ne croyons pas, compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage du Dr McAuliffe en ce qui concerne la capacit\u00e9 offensive des bouteilles de vin, et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'exigu\u00eft\u00e9 de l'espace dans lequel des b\u00e9quilles ou une canne pourraient \u00eatre brandies, que le risque que pr\u00e9sentent ces objets soit comparable \u00e0 celui que constituent les kirpans.\nContrairement au milieu scolaire en cause dans Pandori, o\u00f9 il existe une relation durable entre l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve et l'\u00e9cole et, ce faisant, une possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle d'\u00e9valuer la situation de l'individu qui demande l'accommodement, le secteur du transport a\u00e9rien dessert une population qui se d\u00e9place. On traite chaque jour avec un grand nombre d'individus qu'on n'a gu\u00e8re l'occasion d'\u00e9valuer. [\u2026]\n(Nijjar, aux paragraphes 123 \u00e0 125)\n[156] Cela dit, une preuve de contrainte excessive peut rev\u00eatir \u00ab [\u2026] autant de formes qu\u2019il y a de circonstances \u00bb (Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000, 2008 CSC 43, au paragraphe 12). En fait, la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un employ\u00e9 dans une zone de guerre est une situation unique, et les intim\u00e9s ont produit une preuve des conditions de travail particuli\u00e8res qui r\u00e8gnent en Afghanistan, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit plus t\u00f4t. Comme la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019ampleur du risque et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui le supportent sont des facteurs pertinents \u00bb (Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 RCS 489, \u00e0 la page 521). La preuve d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t indique que non seulement il existe de s\u00e9rieux risques pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Canadiens travaillant en Afghanistan, mais que ces risques se mat\u00e9rialisent souvent et que le danger est bien r\u00e9el. Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que ce ne sont pas seulement la plaignante ou les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI qui supportent ces risques, mais aussi les membres des Forces canadiennes et d\u2019autres militaires \u00e9trangers, et tout particuli\u00e8rement les \u00e9quipes d\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res qui proc\u00e8dent aux \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales. La Convention relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es traite de la fa\u00e7on de contrebalancer la situation des personnes handicap\u00e9es au moyen d\u2019autres droits :\nArticle 10 \u2013 Droit \u00e0 la vie\nLes \u00c9tats Parties r\u00e9affirment que le droit \u00e0 la vie est inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la personne humaine et prennent toutes mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour en assurer aux personnes handicap\u00e9es la jouissance effective, sur la base de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec les autres.\nArticle 11 \u2013 Situations de risque et situations d\u2019urgence humanitaire\nLes \u00c9tats Parties prennent, conform\u00e9ment aux obligations qui leur incombent en vertu du droit international, notamment le droit international humanitaire et le droit international des droits de l'homme, toutes mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer la protection et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 des personnes handicap\u00e9es dans les situations de risque, y compris les conflits arm\u00e9s, les crises humanitaires et les catastrophes naturelles.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[157] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, les services m\u00e9dicaux sont limit\u00e9s et l\u2019espace-lits doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour le traitement des troupes, des civils afghans bless\u00e9s et les situations d\u2019urgence impr\u00e9visibles qui touchent tous les civils affect\u00e9s en Afghanistan. La plaignante a essay\u00e9 de montrer que la situation en Afghanistan n\u2019est pas aussi dangereuse que les intim\u00e9s le pr\u00e9tendent, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019amener tous les risques \u00e0 un niveau acceptable. Cependant, les conditions de guerre en Afghanistan sont telles que le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 sur le milieu de travail de la plaignante est fort limit\u00e9 en raison des conditions instables que cr\u00e9e la guerre et du fait que l\u2019ACDI d\u00e9pend des militaires pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents en Afghanistan. Malgr\u00e9 toutes les mesures de protection et de pr\u00e9caution que prennent les militaires, de nombreuses personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9es et tu\u00e9es en Afghanistan, des attaques sont men\u00e9es contre les complexes militaires, des convois sont pris en embuscade et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 parfois n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9vacuer du personnel de l\u2019ACDI de certains endroits. La plaignante a fait valoir qu\u2019aucun employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 ou tu\u00e9, mais cela ne fait rien pour att\u00e9nuer le risque ou r\u00e9duire la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle situation se produise. Le fait d\u2019ajouter des risques \u00e0 la situation pr\u00e9existante ainsi qu\u2019aux autres circonstances impr\u00e9vues en Afghanistan met davantage en p\u00e9ril des vies, \u00e0 part celle de la plaignante.\n[158] Toute personne affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan accepte qu\u2019il existe un certain risque pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La plaignante et la Commission soutiennent que le degr\u00e9 de risque auquel s\u2019expose la plaignante est un peu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre amen\u00e9 \u00e0 un niveau acceptable si l\u2019employeur mettait en application les conditions que le Dr Beauregard a prescrites et autorisait la plaignante \u00e0 travailler sans d\u00e9placements. Toutes deux font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 raisonnable et soutiennent que la norme qu\u2019applique l\u2019ACDI est un niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 absolue. Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019ACDI applique une norme de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 absolue, qui aurait pour effet de n\u2019autoriser qu\u2019aucun employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ACDI ne soit affect\u00e9 en Afghanistan compte tenu de tous les risques qui y sont pr\u00e9sents. Je conclus que la norme est \u00e9lev\u00e9e, mais lorsque des vies et la sant\u00e9 sont en jeu, c\u2019est ce qui devrait \u00eatre le cas. Les militaires risquent tous les jours leurs vies en Afghanistan, mais ils assument ce risque en vue de favoriser l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la mission que m\u00e8ne le Canada en Afghanistan. Ce serait un risque d\u00e9raisonnable pour eux de mettre leurs vies en danger \u00e0 seule fin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la plaignante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00ab [l]es facteurs permettant de conclure que la contrainte est excessive [\u2026] doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s avec souplesse et bon sens \u00bb (Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, au paragraphe 15). Le droit \u00e0 la vie exige que l\u2019on applique la norme de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 la plus stricte qui soit, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme (DUDH). Toute mesure d\u2019accommodement doit respecter la vie des autres, une vie qui serait affect\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan. L\u2019argument selon lequel les militaires prennent tous les jours des risques n\u2019est pas suffisant pour imposer \u00e0 ceux dont la vie est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en p\u00e9ril des risques additionnels en vue de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[159] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je crois que dans un milieu stable la plaignante g\u00e8re tr\u00e8s bien les sympt\u00f4mes de son affection. Elle est bien inform\u00e9e au sujet de cette derni\u00e8re et a expliqu\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement comment elle la g\u00e8re. Sur ce point, elle est tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible. Mais on ne peut pas dire la m\u00eame chose de la gestion de son affection en Afghanistan. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait administr\u00e9e par erreur deux doses d\u2019insuline, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019en fallait qu\u2019une seule, et qu\u2019elle avait oubli\u00e9 de mesurer son taux de sucre dans le sang avant de se coucher. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 quel \u00e9tait le motif de cette erreur, elle a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce qu\u2019elle jouait aux cartes et \u00e9tait distraite. Je la crois quand elle dit qu\u2019elle a tir\u00e9 une le\u00e7on de cette exp\u00e9rience; mais je signale aussi qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 de maladie en juin 2008 parce que les contacts qu\u2019elle avait avec SC et l\u2019ACDI la stressaient et agissaient sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, et la preuve a \u00e9tabli le lien existant entre un faible dosage d\u2019A1C \u2013 un type d\u2019\u00e9preuve qui mesure la concentration sanguine de sang \u2013 et la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 la plaignante avait ressenti du stress. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin, son m\u00e9decin traitant, la Dre Arnaout, qui avait tout d\u2019abord dit que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 recevoir une affectation en Afghanistan. J\u2019ai soupes\u00e9 cette information par rapport au reste des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits. Le stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination est n\u00e9gligeable par rapport au degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de stress que l\u2019on ressent en Afghanistan. Mes conclusions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne changent pas, m\u00eame si les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019une \u00e9preuve de stress psychologique invasif r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au Canada ont indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte. Je ne puis donner \u00e0 ces r\u00e9sultats plus de poids que la preuve solide que l\u2019ACDI a avanc\u00e9e, avec une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de la part des militaires \u00e0 propos des conditions qui r\u00e8gnent dans la zone de guerre en Afghanistan. Des d\u00e9tails ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis sur la mission, sur les \u00e9vacuations m\u00e9dicales, et la plaignante n\u2019est pas parvenue \u00e0 contredire ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si l\u2019on appliquait les restrictions sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es par le Dr Beauregard, elles ne peuvent pas \u00eatre respect\u00e9es en tout temps s\u2019il survient une urgence ou une situation mettant la vie en p\u00e9ril. Rien ne garantit que la plaignante aurait toujours avec elle tout le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019administrer de l\u2019insuline, surtout dans le cas d\u2019une attaque \u00e0 la roquette ou d\u2019une embuscade. De plus, rien dans la preuve ne montre qu\u2019elle g\u00e8rerait convenablement son \u00e9tat lors d\u2019une embuscade ou d\u2019une attaque \u00e0 la roquette, et la situation devient encore plus hypoth\u00e9tique lorsqu\u2019il faut compter sur les r\u00e9actions d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI pour aider la plaignante.\n[160] Au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des motifs que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t, et sous r\u00e9serve de mes conclusions quant au manquement proc\u00e9dural de l\u2019ACDI \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, je crois que l\u2019on imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI s\u2019il fallait qu\u2019elle prenne des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan, compte tenu des risques pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante, ainsi que pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI et celle des combattants en Afghanistan.\nVII. Conclusion [161] Selon la preuve, la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan imposerait \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI une contrainte excessive. N\u00e9anmoins, cette derni\u00e8re a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation proc\u00e9durale d\u2019\u00e9tudier toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles pour la plaignante et, de ce fait, une violation des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre l\u2019ACDI.\n[162] Pour sa part, SC a \u00e9tabli les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan, qui ne refl\u00e8tent pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En cours d\u2019emploi, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience par l\u2019application de ces Directives. Pour cette raison, SC a viol\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\n[163] En cons\u00e9quence, les deux plaintes sont justifi\u00e9es et le Tribunal envisagera des mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es en vue d\u2019\u00e9liminer ces actes discriminatoires.\nVIII. Les mesures de redressement [164] Lorsqu\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal a le pouvoir r\u00e9parateur de rendre une ordonnance en application des paragraphes 53(2), (3) et(4) de la LCDP, dont le texte est le suivant :\n53. (2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17;\nb) d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\nd) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\ne) d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n(4) Sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 48.9, le membre instructeur peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu\u2019il estime justifi\u00e9s.\n[165] L\u2019objet de la LCDP est de nature r\u00e9paratrice et \u00ab [\u2026] ne vise pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la faute ni \u00e0 punir une conduite \u00bb (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor)), [1987] 2 RCS 84, au paragraphe 13 (Robichaud)). La Loi vise plut\u00f4t principalement \u00e0 \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9celer les actes discriminatoires et \u00e0 les supprimer \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 13). Le Tribunal a affaire \u00e0 des conflits \u00e9motifs et complexes entre des parties, ce qui l\u2019oblige \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00ab [\u2026] capable de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et de souplesse dans la recherche de r\u00e9parations efficaces et la Loi est organis\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 encourager cette souplesse \u00bb (Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherche \u2013 CNRC) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (CF 1re inst.) (Grover)). M\u00eame si le Tribunal jouit d\u2019une certaine souplesse et d\u2019un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 53, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire n\u2019est pas sans limites. En analysant la limite \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268 (Chopra) :\n[\u2026] La premi\u00e8re limite a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue unanimement par les membres formant la Cour dans Morgan : il doit exister un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La deuxi\u00e8me limite, consacr\u00e9e par la Loi m\u00eame, consiste dans le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner l\u2019indemnisation de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. L\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des principes.\n(Chopra, au paragraphe 37)\nPour dire les choses de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\n[\u2026] les ordonnances de redressement doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9es au litige ou au sujet de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e : le \u00ab cadre de la plainte \u00bb ou le \u00ab sujet r\u00e9el \u00bb. Le redressement doit \u00eatre \u00e9gal \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Les ordonnances doivent aussi \u00eatre raisonnables et le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n(Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 (Hughes), au paragraphe 50)\n[166] Pour ce qui est d\u2019appliquer une ordonnance r\u00e9paratrice, la CCDP ou d\u2019autres parties peuvent intervenir, \u00e0 des fins de consultation ou de contr\u00f4le. La participation d\u2019autres intervenants d\u00e9montre que le Tribunal a un r\u00f4le juridictionnel qui se traduit mal dans les aspects techniques ou sp\u00e9cifiques de l\u2019application d\u2019une ordonnance, qui affecte souvent le fonctionnement au jour le jour d\u2019un gouvernement intim\u00e9 ou d\u2019une entreprise intim\u00e9e (voir Hughes, au paragraphe 51).\n[167] Compte tenu de ces principes, voici mes motifs concernant les mesures de redressement que la plaignante et la Commission ont demand\u00e9es.\nUne indemnit\u00e9 pour les primes et les indemnit\u00e9s perdues\n[168] La plaignante souhaite \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP pour les primes et les indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a perdues en rapport avec la p\u00e9riode de 18 mois d\u2019affectation en Afghanistan qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas obtenue. Ces primes et ces indemnit\u00e9s comprennent ce qui suit : une indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s perdue et une prime diff\u00e9rentielle de poste de 17 627 $ pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois ou de 26 440 $ pour une p\u00e9riode de 18 mois; une prime de risque sp\u00e9ciale de 10 015 $ pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 ou de 18 mois; une prime pour faux frais de r\u00e9installation perdue de 4 106 $ pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 \u00e0 18 mois; une indemnisation pour une allocation voyage de vacances perdue [l\u2019allocation moins les heures \u00e0 utiliser pour un cong\u00e9 de d\u00e9tente] au niveau PM-05 d\u2019un montant de 32 708 $ pour une affectation de 12 mois (un an) et de 49 062 $ pour une affectation de 18 mois pour une p\u00e9riode de 6 mois et une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an, au niveau PM-06, au montant de 31 779 $ pour 12 mois et de 47 505 $ pour 18 mois; une indemnit\u00e9 pour les occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues, moins le temps suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquis au Canada, au niveau PM-05 [5 034 $ moins 774 $ par mois] pour 12 mois, 38 340 $, au niveau PM-06 niveau 2 2008 [5 682 $ moins 774 $ par mois] pour 12 mois, 44 174 $, au niveau PM-06 niveau 3 2009 [5 767 $ moins 774 $ par mois] pour 18 mois 66 642 $, en prenant pour base le niveau 2 pour 12 mois plus le niveau 3 pour 6 mois; une indemnit\u00e9 pour un revenu locatif perdu pendant 12 mois de 14 400 $ et pendant 18 mois de 21 600 $; une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9nage engag\u00e9es pendant 12 mois (5 808 $) et pendant 18 mois (8 712 $).\n[169] L\u2019ACDI a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle subirait une contrainte excessive si elle prenait des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante en Afghanistan. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accorderai aucun montant directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affectation en Afghanistan, comme la prime de risque sp\u00e9ciale ou l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s. Cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019applique sp\u00e9cifiquement aux secteurs dangereux qui pr\u00e9sentent les niveaux de contrainte les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s et elle n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e dans toutes les missions internationales. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, pour pouvoir accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une compensation pour l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour risque d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s, le Tribunal doit \u00eatre convaincu qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e en Afghanistan. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que cette mesure aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive, aucune somme li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019affectation en Afghanistan ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) vise \u00e0 indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Je ne puis trouver aucune explication logique dans le fait de r\u00e9clamer des frais de r\u00e9installation, un revenu locatif perdu, des d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9nage, etc. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de d\u00e9penses que la plaignante a engag\u00e9es. Les d\u00e9penses ne doivent \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es que si elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, et non pas demand\u00e9es sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es. Cela dit, je crois que si la plaignante n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle a subie pendant tout le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et d\u2019affectation, elle aurait obtenu un poste dans un autre pays. M\u00eame si on lui a refus\u00e9 l\u2019affectation en Afghanistan, elle aurait pu \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, \u00e0 tout le moins, dans un pays ami. Je conclus qu\u2019elle aurait eu \u00e0 faire du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire plus souvent qu\u2019au Canada, mais pas autant qu\u2019en Afghanistan, o\u00f9 les conditions sont difficiles. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas grand-chose \u00e0 faire en Afghanistan, de sorte que, en bout de ligne, les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI accomplissent habituellement plus d\u2019heures de travail qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019accoutum\u00e9e. La preuve a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il est raisonnable de pr\u00e9sumer que la plaignante se serait trouv\u00e9e au niveau PM-06 \u00e0 cause du travail qu\u2019elle avait fait auparavant. Je d\u00e9velopperai plus loin mes motifs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, dans la section intitul\u00e9e \u00ab La nomination et le d\u00e9ploiement \u00bb. Je n\u2019ai pas assez de documents en main pour quantifier la quantit\u00e9 moyenne de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire qu\u2019effectuerait un employ\u00e9 de niveau PM-06 dans un pays ami. De ce fait, j\u2019accorderai un d\u00e9lai de deux mois aux parties pour me fournir des observations sur le montant appropri\u00e9, et je demeurerai saisie de l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que cette information soit disponible.\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral\n[170] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral d\u2019un montant de 20 000 $, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. Le montant de 20 000 $ est le maximum autoris\u00e9 dans les limites de la LCDP sous ce chef de dommages. Le pr\u00e9judice moral est difficile \u00e0 quantifier. Lorsqu\u2019une personne souffre, la seule personne qui a une v\u00e9ritable connaissance de cette souffrance particuli\u00e8re est celle qui la subit. Lorsqu\u2019une personne ressent de la douleur, il n\u2019existe aucune somme d\u2019argent qui peut la compenser de mani\u00e8re juste. La douleur morale que l\u2019on associe \u00e0 la discrimination est subjective et varie d\u2019une personne \u00e0 une autre. Du point de vue de la personne qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, il faudrait accorder d\u2019importantes sommes d\u2019argent pour refl\u00e9ter ce que cette personne a v\u00e9cu et lui rendre justice. Nul ne devrait souffrir, et aucun montant ne peut refl\u00e9ter cette injustice. Le montant accord\u00e9 ne remettra jamais enti\u00e8rement la personne dans la situation o\u00f9 elle se serait trouv\u00e9e si la discrimination n\u2019avait jamais eu lieu, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment subjectif de la discrimination et des limites de la LCDP et de la jurisprudence. Les cicatrices psychologiques prennent souvent un temps consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir et peuvent avoir une incidence sur l\u2019estime qu\u2019une personne a de soi. Cela dit, quand une preuve \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une douleur et d\u2019une souffrance \u2013 un pr\u00e9judice moral \u2013 il faut tenter d\u2019accorder une compensation. La plaignante a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 cause de la fa\u00e7on dont elle se sentait au travail face \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019ACDI et SC traitaient l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et le processus d\u2019accommodement. Elle a attendu des r\u00e9ponses des deux intim\u00e9s, mais ces r\u00e9ponses ne sont jamais arriv\u00e9es. On a dit \u00e0 la plaignante que le CCM-SC accepterait le troisi\u00e8me avis m\u00e9dical mais, en fin de compte, il ne l\u2019a pas fait et, dans l\u2019intervalle, il a fait passer \u00e0 la plaignante des tests qui maintenaient ses espoirs. Ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 an\u00e9antis par la fa\u00e7on dont les deux intim\u00e9s se sont occup\u00e9s de la situation. Elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de ses droits et a \u00e9t\u00e9 induite en erreur de deux fa\u00e7ons : 1) en se faisant dire qu\u2019une liste de pays o\u00f9 elle pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e serait fournie, et 2) aussit\u00f4t que des m\u00e9decins pr\u00e9sents dans ces pays fourniraient les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires, elle obtiendrait plus d\u2019information. Ces renseignements n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s et aucun suivi n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les intim\u00e9s. La plaignante a perdu des occasions d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u00e0 cause de ces d\u00e9lais. Dans tout le processus, la plaignante s\u2019est sentie d\u00e9favorablement trait\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019on empi\u00e9tait sur sa dignit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les montants que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9s, ainsi que l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, j\u2019ordonne aux intim\u00e9s de payer chacun la somme de 5 000 $ \u00e0 la plaignante.\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9\n[171] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pour un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 20 000 $ en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Elle n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette demande, pas plus que des arguments d\u00e9taill\u00e9s n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s, mais la preuve est suffisante pour poursuivre l\u2019analyse de cette affaire. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que SC a dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019il souscrirait \u00e0 l\u2019avis m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant, quel qu\u2019il soit. SC \u00e9tait au courant de ce qu\u2019il avait dit et a modifi\u00e9 son approche quand l\u2019avis n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 celui auquel il s\u2019attendait. Il a \u00e9galement r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb et a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un mauvais choix de mots qui, en fait, pouvait induire en erreur une personne qui proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation. SC n\u2019a pas essay\u00e9 de rectifier le texte des directives lorsqu\u2019il a transmis les renseignements au Dr Beauregard, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019a remis \u00e0 ce dernier la premi\u00e8re section du GEST, o\u00f9 il est dit que les directives sont de nature instructive et non imp\u00e9rative. SC savait donc ce qu\u2019il faisait. Pour sa part, l\u2019ACDI a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre au courriel dans lequel la plaignante lui demandait d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de l\u2019affecter en Afghanistan. L\u2019ACDI ne peut ignorer le fait qu\u2019aucun renseignement additionnel n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante au sujet d\u2019autres affectations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les autres d\u00e9cisions que le Tribunal a rendues sous ce chef d\u2019indemnisation, je conclus que les deux intim\u00e9s, en se comportant d\u2019une telle fa\u00e7on, ont commis un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. J\u2019ordonne aux intim\u00e9s de payer chacun \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 5 000 $.\nLes cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie\n[172] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, la plaignante demande le r\u00e9tablissement de cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie totalisant 55 jours. Cette p\u00e9riode de 55 jours est li\u00e9e au cong\u00e9 de maladie qu\u2019elle a pris au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2009, en juin. Elle correspond \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 son m\u00e9decin lui a dit que le stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination et aux probl\u00e8mes relatifs au travail avait une incidence sur sa glyc\u00e9mie et son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. La preuve corroborait la recommandation du m\u00e9decin. J\u2019ordonne donc le r\u00e9tablissement de la totalit\u00e9 des cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie dus \u00e0 la plaignante.\nLes cr\u00e9dits de jours de vacances\n[173] La plaignante demande aussi que l\u2019on r\u00e9tablisse les cr\u00e9dits de jours de vacances totalisant 15 jours, p\u00e9riode qu\u2019elle a prise pour se pr\u00e9parer et assister aux proc\u00e9dures li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa plainte. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne le r\u00e9tablissement des cr\u00e9dits relatifs \u00e0 15 jours de vacances.\nLa nomination et le d\u00e9ploiement\n[174] La plaignante demande qu\u2019on la nomme \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX-01 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP. Elle demande aussi qu\u2019on la d\u00e9ploie \u00e0 un poste op\u00e9rationnel au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes g\u00e9ographiques (DGPG) de l\u2019ACDI, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, et qu\u2019elle soit affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un pays de son choix o\u00f9 elle pourrait amener sa famille.\n[175] En d\u00e9cembre 2008, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 promue au poste de gestionnaire du programme de d\u00e9veloppement international \u00e0 l\u2019Unit\u00e9 d\u2019examen des r\u00e9sultats et de la reddition de comptes, un poste de niveau PM-06 (poste qu\u2019elle occupait \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire depuis le mois de mai 2007). En m\u00eame temps, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u2013 avec succ\u00e8s \u2013 \u00e0 une affectation int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 titre d\u2019adjointe minist\u00e9rielle sup\u00e9rieure au cabinet du ministre, un poste de niveau A\/EX-1. Elle a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste d\u2019adjointe minist\u00e9rielle sup\u00e9rieure par int\u00e9rim et a pris un cong\u00e9 pour raison de sant\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir du 20 juin 2009, ou aux environs de cette date. Vers le 1er septembre 2009, la plaignante a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le poste qu\u2019elle occupait ant\u00e9rieurement, en tant que gestionnaire du programme de d\u00e9veloppement international au sein de l\u2019Unit\u00e9 d\u2019examen des r\u00e9sultats et de la reddition de comptes, o\u00f9 elle continue de travailler. Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que rien n\u2019oblige \u00e0 accorder une affectation \u00e0 la plaignante car elle occupe d\u00e9j\u00e0 un poste int\u00e9ressant au sein de l\u2019ACDI et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste d\u2019un niveau sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel d\u00e9butent de nombreux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI. Je ne suis pas du m\u00eame avis. Je conclus que la plaignante, sans sa d\u00e9ficience, aurait obtenu une affectation en Afghanistan ou ailleurs \u00e0 cause de son aptitude \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions requises. L\u2019ACDI n\u2019a jamais contest\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est une bonne employ\u00e9e, apte \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 des postes d\u2019un niveau sup\u00e9rieur. En fait, il ressort de la preuve, dans un courriel \u00e9manant de Dave Metcalfe (Examen des r\u00e9sultats et de la reddition de comptes, GFA, ACDI) et destin\u00e9 \u00e0 Michael Collins, que ces derniers l\u2019ont qualifi\u00e9e de [traduction] \u00ab remarquable, une ressource et une employ\u00e9e d\u2019excellente qualit\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] nous pourrions peut-\u00eatre faire de notre mieux pour la placer ailleurs dans l\u2019Agence, \u00e0 un endroit qui m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 une affectation \u00e0 un pays diff\u00e9rent pour lequel SC donnerait son soutien compte tenu de la situation [\u2026] nous devrions essayer de la garder au sein du GTA ou du moins au sein de l\u2019Agence.\n[176] Sur ce fondement, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 la DGPG au niveau PM-06 et de prendre avec elle les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019affecter dans un pays ami, faisant partie de ses trois premiers choix o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\nLe dossier du personnel\n[177] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on \u00e9limine sur-le-champ de son dossier du personnel tout bl\u00e2me li\u00e9 \u00e0 la poursuite de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP. Selon la preuve que l\u2019ACDI a produite, ce bl\u00e2me \u00e9tait li\u00e9 au comportement de la plaignante au travail, qui avait envoy\u00e9 des courriels et parl\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de gens qu\u2019il le fallait au sujet des plaintes. La preuve a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait parfois exprim\u00e9e d\u2019un ton cassant dans ses courriels. La plaignante a fait valoir qu\u2019on lui avait demand\u00e9 de retirer sa plainte en \u00e9change d\u2019un poste. Cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9e, et la personne qui lui avait cens\u00e9ment fait cette d\u00e9claration n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Je n\u2019y accorde donc aucun poids. Si le bl\u00e2me avait eu lieu parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ACDI, j\u2019aurais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cela comme une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles. Je ne crois pas que c\u2019\u00e9tait pour cette raison-l\u00e0, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle avait fait plusieurs tentatives, m\u00eame aupr\u00e8s du cabinet du ministre, pour faire valoir son point. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait formul\u00e9 des menaces et des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs \u00e0 propos de certains membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de direction de l\u2019ACDI, la plaignante a admis ne pas avoir agi de mani\u00e8re rationnelle. Il est l\u00e9gitime de d\u00e9fendre ses propres droits, mais il y a des limites \u00e0 respecter; sinon, il faut en subir les cons\u00e9quences. La demande est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nLes honoraires juridiques\n[178] La plaignante demande d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e d\u2019honoraires juridiques d\u2019un montant de 2 712,68 $. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309 (Mowat), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le TCDP n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 adjuger des d\u00e9pens en vertu des dispositions de la LCDP. L\u2019autorisation de porter l\u2019affaire en appel devant la CSC a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. Cependant, sur le fondement de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mowat, je n\u2019accorde aucun montant au titre des honoraires juridiques.\nLes mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques\n[179] La plaignante demande ce qui suit :\n- une ordonnance portant que les intim\u00e9s mettent fin \u00e0 leurs actes discriminatoires contre les employ\u00e9s qui souhaitent obtenir une affectation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et qui tombent sous le coup de l\u2019interdiction m\u00e9dicale absolue que contiennent les politiques que les intim\u00e9s appliquent au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s;\n- une ordonnance portant que les intim\u00e9s consultent la Commission (CCDP), conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, en vue de dresser un plan pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019il survienne d\u2019autres incidents de discrimination fond\u00e9s sur une d\u00e9ficience lors de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale des employ\u00e9s qui souhaitent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger;\n- une ordonnance portant que les intim\u00e9s \u00e9tablissent des politiques \u00e9crites qui soient satisfaisantes pour Mme Cruden et la Commission, en vue de traiter de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019aptitude sur le plan m\u00e9dical \u00e0 une affectation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger dans un d\u00e9lai de moins de six mois, et que ces politiques comprennent un processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e pour les personnes \u00e9valu\u00e9es;\n- des conclusions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es au sujet du caract\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9 des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Les \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb cr\u00e9ent une preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes atteintes d\u2019une affection chronique et, lorsqu\u2019elles sont appliqu\u00e9es, ces exigences occasionnent une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable. Il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et d\u2019affectation pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette discrimination;\n- la Convention relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a o) de son pr\u00e9ambule, mentionne : \u00ab Estimant que les personnes handicap\u00e9es devraient avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de participer activement aux processus de prise de d\u00e9cisions concernant les politiques et programmes, en particulier ceux qui les concernent directement [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[180] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019ordonne que toutes les mesures qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent soient prises, au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits et des conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nLes modifications \u00e0 apporter aux politiques et aux directives de SC ainsi qu\u2019aux politiques de l\u2019ACDI\n[181] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits et les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ont permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan et, par-dessus tout, les \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb, doivent \u00eatre remplac\u00e9es pour \u00e9viter toute diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et pour \u00e9valuer les personnes au cas par cas. Les directives doivent \u00eatre clarifi\u00e9es afin de garantir que leur interpr\u00e9tation n\u2019am\u00e8ne pas les m\u00e9decins \u00e0 \u00e9carter toute personne souffrant d\u2019une affection chronique. L\u2019ACDI doit veiller \u00e0 ce que ses employ\u00e9s soient pleinement inform\u00e9s de leurs droits ainsi que du processus d\u2019affectation tout entier, ce qui inclut les exigences m\u00e9dicales et la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019a un employ\u00e9 de solliciter en temps opportun un troisi\u00e8me avis. Le libell\u00e9 des \u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb doit \u00eatre chang\u00e9 afin de refl\u00e9ter l\u2019existence d\u2019un crit\u00e8re m\u00e9dical strict pour les affectations en Afghanistan, mais sans instaurer une interdiction compl\u00e8te. Il est ressorti de la preuve que les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ACDI n\u2019\u00e9taient pas familiers avec le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de SC, ni avec l\u2019existence de la DSE9. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les intim\u00e9s ont produits n\u2019ont pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient une r\u00e9elle connaissance des mesures d\u2019accommodement, ni des dispositions de la LCDP. Il est donc justifi\u00e9 de prendre des mesures de formation. Je ne souscris tout simplement pas au temps que demande la Commission pour ce qui est d\u2019offrir la formation requise. La Commission a demand\u00e9 que la formation soit suivie dans un d\u00e9lai de six mois. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Je suis consciente qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de fixer un d\u00e9lai, mais je conclus qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai de six mois est d\u00e9raisonnable pour des organisations d\u2019une taille aussi grande que celle de l\u2019ACDI et de SC. Je tendrais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 dire : dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable d\u2019au plus un an.\n[182] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne ce qui suit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que la Commission a demand\u00e9 :\na) que SC modifie le GEST de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9liminer dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan toute mention d\u2019\u00ab exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb et qu\u2019il adopte plut\u00f4t une d\u00e9marche qui \u00e9num\u00e8re simplement les facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans le cadre d\u2019une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, tout en reconnaissant express\u00e9ment qu\u2019aucun facteur unique ne sera n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9terminant;\nb) que SC modifie ses politiques ou en cr\u00e9e une nouvelle, afin d\u2019exiger que, dans les cas o\u00f9 un m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialiste traitant donne, au sujet de l\u2019aptitude d\u2019un employ\u00e9, un avis qui diff\u00e8re de l\u2019avis initial du MST et o\u00f9 SC ne souscrit pas \u00e0 l\u2019avis du sp\u00e9cialiste :\ni) qu\u2019il consulte le sp\u00e9cialiste traitant afin d\u2019analyser les fondements des avis diff\u00e9rents;\nii) que, s\u2019il n\u2019est toujours pas d\u2019accord, il offre sans d\u00e9lai de faire subir \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant par un sp\u00e9cialiste du domaine appropri\u00e9;\niii) que, s\u2019il est insatisfait de l\u2019avis du sp\u00e9cialiste ind\u00e9pendant, il consulte ce dernier pour analyser les fondements des avis diff\u00e9rents;\niv) que, en fin de compte, si aucun r\u00e8glement n\u2019est conclu, il soumette au minist\u00e8re employeur une description compl\u00e8te, objective et impartiale de toutes les

l\u2019ACDI modifient leurs politiques, ou en cr\u00e9ent une nouvelle, afin d\u2019indiquer clairement que la LCDP et l\u2019\u00ab obligation d\u2019accommodement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive \u00bb doivent \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration et appliqu\u00e9es chaque fois que l\u2019on formule une recommandation ou que l\u2019on prend une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l\u2019aptitude m\u00e9dicale d\u2019un employ\u00e9 civil \u00e0 une affectation, quel que soit le lieu de cette affectation;\nd) que l\u2019ACDI modifie ses politiques, ou en cr\u00e9e une nouvelle, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 mettre en place un m\u00e9canisme qui garantira que tous les employ\u00e9s qui pr\u00e9senteront leur candidature en vue d\u2019une affectation (ainsi qu\u2019en vue d\u2019une affectation temporaire, dans le cas de l\u2019Afghanistan) seront tout d\u2019abord mis au courant :\ni) que tous les candidats retenus auront \u00e0 subir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 leur d\u00e9ploiement, de la part de SC, ou d\u2019un autre fournisseur si l\u2019ACDI l\u2019estime appropri\u00e9;\nii) que s\u2019ils obtiennent une \u00e9valuation n\u00e9gative, ils auront le droit aux termes de la DSE9 de soumettre un avis \u00e9crit d\u2019un m\u00e9decin traitant \u00e0 SC, qui transmettra alors une nouvelle \u00e9valuation \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, peut-\u00eatre apr\u00e8s avoir offert \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 en question la possibilit\u00e9 de subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant;\niii) que si SC ne demande pas un avis m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant, l\u2019ACDI pourra elle-m\u00eame offrir \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 une possibilit\u00e9 de subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant, dont les r\u00e9sultats seront transmis \u00e0 SC pour une \u00e9valuation additionnelle;\niv) en fin de compte, c\u2019est l\u2019ACDI, et non SC ou un autre minist\u00e8re, qui prendra la d\u00e9cision finale au sujet de la soumission d\u2019un candidat \u00e0 l\u2019assentiment du chef de mission.\ne) que SC dispense une formation \u00e0 tous les gestionnaires et tous les MST qui s\u2019occupent de faire subir des \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 un d\u00e9ploiement sur :\ni) l\u2019application de la DSE9 \u00e0 leur travail;\nii) l\u2019application de la LCDP \u00e0 leur travail, dans la

Les plaignants all\u00e8guent que le refus d\u2019octroyer le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit en application de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens est une pratique discriminatoire fond\u00e9e [Traduction] \u00ab [...] sur le motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille et sur celui du sexe au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb (la LCDP). \u00c0 la derni\u00e8re page de chacune des plaintes, sous le titre [Traduction] \u00ab Motifs de distinction illicites \u00bb, chaque plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription dans la Loi sur les Indiens sont discriminatoires parce que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au statut d\u2019Indien inscrit se rendrait plus loin dans leur lign\u00e9e si leur grand\u2011parent indien avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un homme plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une femme :\n[Traduction]\nJe crois que la r\u00e8gle d\u00e9coulant du projet de loi C\u201131 est discriminatoire envers moi et envers [mes fr\u00e8res\/mon fr\u00e8re et ma soeur] en raison des motifs de distinction illicite fond\u00e9s sur la situation de famille et sur le sexe au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne parce que le projet de loi C\u201131 continue de faire une distinction et d\u2019\u00e9tablir une discrimination envers les descendants de femmes indiennes qui se sont mari\u00e9es \u00e0 des hommes non indiens, en limitant l\u2019acc\u00e8s au statut d\u2019Indien inscrit \u00e0 un certain niveau de la lign\u00e9e, qui ne s\u2019appliquerait pas \u00e0 un homme indien qui a le m\u00eame h\u00e9ritage.\n[3] Le 9 novembre 2009, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au Tribunal, en application du paragraphe 40(4) et de l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP, pour instruction commune.\n- Les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en date du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2010.\n- La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en date du 9 f\u00e9vrier 2010.\n- L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en date du 1er mars 2010.\n[4] Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il suffit de d\u00e9crire la situation des plaignants telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et dans celui de la Commission, comme suit :\na) Les plaignants sont tous n\u00e9s avant 1985. Ils ont un grand\u2011parent indien : une femme qui a perdu son statut lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est mari\u00e9e avec un non-Indien avant 1985, et dont le statut a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens lorsque les modifications du projet de loi C\u201131 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es en 1985. En application de ces modifications, les enfants de son mariage avec un homme non indien (dont l\u2019un \u00e9tait le p\u00e8re des plaignants, Eugene) ont pu obtenir le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit en application du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Comme les modifications de 1985 ne donnaient \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re qu\u2019un statut suivant le paragraphe 6(2), et comme leur m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas indienne, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes, ils n\u2019avaient droit \u00e0 aucun statut sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, puisque le paragraphe 6(2) ne permet pas \u00e0 une personne de l\u00e9guer son statut \u00e0 des enfants que cette personne a eus avec un non\u2011Indien. Par cons\u00e9quent, les enfants que les plaignants ont eus avec des non\u2011Indiens depuis 1985 n\u2019ont pas droit \u00e0 un statut.\nb) Les plaignants ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un tableau qui \u00e9tablit l\u2019historique de leur famille et de leur statut et le compare \u00e0 l\u2019historique d\u2019une famille hypoth\u00e9tique qui est tout \u00e0 fait identique, sauf pour le sexe du grand\u2011parent indien. En d\u2019autres mots, dans l\u2019historique de la famille hypoth\u00e9tique, le grand\u2011parent indien est un homme plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une femme. Toutes les dates de naissance, de mariage et de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sont les m\u00eames dans les deux sc\u00e9narios. Comme le montre le tableau, les plaignants dans le sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique patrilin\u00e9aire, au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, auraient eu droit au statut d\u2019Indien inscrit suivant le paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, et pourraient donner \u00e0 leurs enfants un statut suivant le paragraphe 6(2), alors que dans leur sc\u00e9nario r\u00e9el matrilin\u00e9aire, ils n\u2019ont aucun statut, que ce soit suivant le paragraphe 6(1) ou le paragraphe 6(2).\nc) Les plaignants soutiennent que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement, qui d\u00e9coule d\u2019une discrimination caus\u00e9e par la Loi sur les Indiens, a eu deux effets pr\u00e9judiciables : premi\u00e8rement, eux\u2011m\u00eames se sont vu refuser le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit et les avantages qui en d\u00e9coulent et, deuxi\u00e8mement, ils se sont vu refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de donner un statut \u00e0 leurs enfants.\n[5] Le 6 avril 2009, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire McIvor c. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), dans laquelle elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019ont aucun effet parce que ces dispositions enfreignent le droit du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, droit garanti par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte) et que cette infraction n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e par l\u2019article premier de la Charte. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a suspendu sa d\u00e9claration pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an et a par la suite prolong\u00e9 cette suspension \u00e0 deux occasions \u2013 la derni\u00e8re suspension a eu lieu du 5 juillet 2010 jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011 et visait \u00e0 donner au l\u00e9gislateur le temps d\u2019examiner et de consid\u00e9rer de nouvelles modifications \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[6] En avril et en ao\u00fbt 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal, qu\u2019il a obtenu, pendant que le Parlement discutait de l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la Loi favorisant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans McIvor c. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs).\n[7] Le projet de loi C-3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 11 mars 2010, a obtenu la sanction royale le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2010 et est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 31 janvier 2011.\n[8] Entre autres choses, le projet de loi C\u20113 modifiait les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription en ajoutant un nouvel alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens. Cet alin\u00e9a a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie de statut au sens du paragraphe 6(1) pour les personnes admissibles dont les m\u00e8res avaient perdu leur statut lorsqu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9taient mari\u00e9es \u00e0 des non-Indiens avant les modifications de 1985. Cependant, les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, conf\u00e8rent le statut pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(1) aux personnes qui ont le m\u00eame historique familial que les plaignants, mais dont le seul grand\u2011parent indien \u00e9tait un homme, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une femme. Les personnes qui ont un statut au sens du paragraphe 6(1) peuvent donner le statut d\u2019Indien aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont avec des non-Indiens. Les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, n\u2019accordent pas aux plaignants le statut pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(1) et, par cons\u00e9quent les plaignants ne peuvent pas donner le statut d\u2019Indien aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont eus, ou qu\u2019ils auront, avec une personne non indienne.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s la sanction royale du projet de loi C\u20113, les trois plaignants ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouvelles demandes au Bureau du registraire des Indiens, demandant leur inscription. Jeremy Matson a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande pour obtenir l\u2019inscription de sa fille, Iris Matson.\n[10] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Jeremy Matson en date du 9 mai 2011, le registraire des Indiens a confirm\u00e9 que (i) le p\u00e8re des plaignants, Eugene Matson, pouvait maintenant \u00eatre inscrit suivant le du nouvel alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1), plut\u00f4t que suivant le paragraphe 6(2), ii) Jeremy Matson \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent admissible \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en application du paragraphe 6(2), en tant qu\u2019enfant qui a un parent indien et (iii) Jeremy Matson \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent inscrit suivant la Loi sur les Indiens en date du 9 mai 2011. La lettre expliquait aussi que la nation Squamish, \u00e0 laquelle les anc\u00eatres de Jeremy Matson appartenaient, \u00e9tait l\u2019une des bandes qui avait choisi, depuis les modifications de 1985, de contr\u00f4ler elle-m\u00eame les adh\u00e9sions \u00e0 la bande.\n[11] Par courriels dat\u00e9s du 13 juin et du 14 juin 2011, Mardy Matson et Melody Schneider ont avis\u00e9 la Commission que leurs demandes avaient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es et qu\u2019eux aussi \u00e9taient admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019inscription suivant le paragraphe 6(2) et qu\u2019ils avaient obtenu le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit.\n[12] Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Jeremy Matson dat\u00e9e du 20 mai 2011, le registraire des Indiens a rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019inscription pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de la fille de Jeremy Matson, Iris Matson. La lettre d\u00e9clarait que, bien que le projet de loi C\u20113 avait chang\u00e9 le droit au statut du p\u00e8re de Jeremy Matson (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire Eugene Matson), il n\u2019avait pas chang\u00e9 le droit au statut de sa fille (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire Iris Matson), qui n\u2019\u00e9tait toujours pas admissible.\n[13] En raison de la situation d\u00e9crite aux paragraphes 7 \u00e0 12 inclusivement, les plaignants et la Commission ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s en date du 28 juin 2011 et du 4 juillet 2011 (les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s) respectivement afin que les plaintes se poursuivent avec les modifications qu\u2019ils croyaient n\u00e9cessaires pour refl\u00e9ter le fait que le projet de loi C\u20113 leur avait accord\u00e9 un statut suivant le paragraphe 6(2), sans leur donner le droit de donner un statut aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont ou qu\u2019ils auront avec des non-Indiens, mais ne leur a pas donn\u00e9 un statut suivant le paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, comme cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans leur sc\u00e9nario comparatif hypoth\u00e9tique patrilin\u00e9aire, tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, suivant lequel ils auraient pu donner leur statut d\u2019Indien \u00e0 leurs enfants dont l\u2019autre parent n\u2019est pas un Indien.\n[14] \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l\u2019audience, que j\u2019ai tenue avec les parties le 11 juillet 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019opposait \u00e0 l\u2019acceptation par le Tribunal des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s des plaignants et de la Commission. J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 aux plaignants et \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9poser des avis de requ\u00eate demandant l\u2019acceptation du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s. La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate et ses observations le 11 ao\u00fbt 2011, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur requ\u00eate et leurs observations le 15 ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate le 29 ao\u00fbt 2011, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9moire relatif \u00e0 la requ\u00eate le 1er septembre 2011 et les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9moire relatif \u00e0 la requ\u00eate le 3 septembre 2011.\n[15] Compte tenu de leur interpr\u00e9tation des faits, les observations de la Commission et des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs requ\u00eates sont les suivantes :\na) Le Tribunal a le pouvoir l\u00e9gal d\u2019ordonner l\u2019acceptation du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s ou d\u2019ordonner que les plaintes soient modifi\u00e9es, si n\u00e9cessaire.\nb) Les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ne doivent pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9es et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on trop \u00e9troite ou technique et l\u2019instruction du Tribunal n\u2019est pas strictement li\u00e9e par les limites du formulaire de plainte initial.\nc) C\u2019est l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui \u00e9tablit les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises d\u2019une audience, et non le formulaire de plainte.\nd) En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019essence des plaintes est exactement la m\u00eame que la substance des all\u00e9gations dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens sont discriminatoires en fonction du sexe ou de la situation de famille parce qu\u2019elles permettent au statut d\u2019Indien d\u2019\u00eatre transmis plus loin dans une famille issue d\u2019un grand\u2011p\u00e8re indien, par comparaison avec une famille issue d\u2019une grand-m\u00e8re indienne, mais qui sont semblables en tous autres points.\ne) Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s ne soul\u00e8vent pas de nouvelles all\u00e9gations. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils reconnaissent l\u2019octroi d\u2019un statut aux plaignants apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, et qu\u2019ils soulignent la diff\u00e9rence de traitement continue en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 de donner leur statut \u00e0 leurs enfants, les expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s clarifient simplement et rendent explicites les consid\u00e9rations juridiques actuelles de la situation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans les plaintes originales.\nf) Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s ont correctement avis\u00e9 toutes les parties des questions d\u00e9coulant des plaintes originales et ils satisfont \u00e0 leur fonction pr\u00e9vue qui est d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019audience.\ng) L\u2019acceptation du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s ne causerait aucun pr\u00e9judice aux parties. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est au courant de la question du statut des enfants depuis un certain temps.\nh) Le fait d\u2019exiger que l\u2019\u00e9tape suppl\u00e9mentaire officielle de la modification des plaintes soit respect\u00e9e serait contraire aux directives selon lesquelles l\u2019instruction des plaintes au Tribunal se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\ni) Subsidiairement, si la modification des plaintes est requise avant que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s soient accept\u00e9s, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019accepter les plaintes modifi\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles respectent la substance de la plainte originale, n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019autre partie et ne visent pas \u00e0 soulever des all\u00e9gations qui ne peuvent, de toute \u00e9vidence, \u00eatre accueillies. Les modifications ont leurs \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00bb dans les circonstances qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission dans la plainte et ne soul\u00e8vent pas une \u00ab nouvelle plainte \u00bb qui n\u2019est pas, en droit ou dans les faits, li\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte originale.\n[16] Compte tenu de son interpr\u00e9tation des faits, les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en opposition aux observations de la Commission et des plaignants sont, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les suivantes :\na) L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ne peut pas cr\u00e9er une nouvelle plainte, mais il d\u00e9coule du libell\u00e9 et des all\u00e9gations du formulaire de plainte.\nb) Comme les formulaires de plainte manquent de pr\u00e9cision, il n\u2019est pas juste que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions cr\u00e9e un nouveau fondement pour une plainte qui n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9cise.\nc) Les modifications propos\u00e9es ont l\u2019effet de cr\u00e9er de toutes nouvelles questions, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la loi en vertu de laquelle l\u2019inscription est effectu\u00e9e et les personnes qui pourraient \u00eatre affect\u00e9es par cette loi.\nd) Les modifications propos\u00e9es aux plaintes ne sont pas appropri\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas d\u2019 \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00bb dans la plainte originale et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit essentiellement d\u2019une nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission et d\u2019un renvoi au Tribunal.\ne) Les plaintes des plaignants sont maintenant th\u00e9oriques en raison de leur inscription en application du paragraphe 6 (2) de la Loi sur les Indiens et devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\nf) Les modifications propos\u00e9es aux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions ou aux formulaires de plaintes originaux repr\u00e9sentent un changement si important au renvoi initial qu\u2019elles ne rel\u00e8vent pas du cadre de la LCDP.\ng) De nouvelles plaintes devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et la Commission devrait tenir une nouvelle enqu\u00eate.\n[17] \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9sentation des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions est acceptable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La plainte, pour l\u2019essentiel n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9, cependant, la loi a chang\u00e9. Avant l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, lorsque les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes, ils n\u2019avaient aucun statut d\u2019Indien inscrit en application de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Leurs plaintes, sans qu\u2019elles soient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par rapport au paragraphe 6(1) ou au paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, visaient l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, existait par rapport au statut entre eux et leurs comparateurs dans le sc\u00e9nario th\u00e9orique patrilin\u00e9aire, qui avaient un statut en application du paragraphe 6(1) et le droit de donner leur statut \u00e0 leurs enfants dont l\u2019autre parent n\u2019\u00e9tait pas Indien. Il n\u2019est pas surprenant que les plaignants n\u2019aient pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les paragraphes 6(1) ou 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, compte tenu de la nature plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du formulaire de plainte, du fait qu\u2019ils ne sont pas des avocats et de la probabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 mon avis, qu\u2019ils s\u2019attendaient simplement \u00e0 ce que leurs plaintes couvrent toute la diff\u00e9rence entre eux et leurs comparateurs th\u00e9oriques. Ils n\u2019auraient pas su \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque que le projet de loi C\u20113, serait adopt\u00e9 sans une modification qui leur donnerait le m\u00eame statut en application du paragraphe 6(1) que celui auquel leurs comparateurs th\u00e9oriques ont droit.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C-3 et l\u2019inscription des plaignants en application du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, il est devenu appropri\u00e9 que des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, compte tenu des circonstances. Cela ne devrait pas \u00eatre surprenant pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 et cela ne soul\u00e8ve rien qui soit essentiellement nouveau, \u00e0 mon avis. Il existe un lien raisonnable et logique entre les plaintes et les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une perte de temps et de ressources et il ne serait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public que les plaignants doivent retourner devant la Commission pour pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles plaintes dans les circonstances.\n[19] Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s mettront l\u2019affaire \u00e0 jour afin qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre trait\u00e9e ad\u00e9quatement. Les plaintes des plaignants au sujet de leur propre inscription suivant la Loi sur les Indiens sont maintenant th\u00e9oriques puisque les plaignants sont maintenant inscrits. Cependant, la partie de leurs plaintes qui, \u00e0 mon avis, portait implicitement sur la possibilit\u00e9 de donner ce statut \u00e0 tout enfant qu\u2019ils auront avec un non-Indien, comme c\u2019est pr\u00e9sentement le cas pour leurs comparateurs th\u00e9oriques, demeure une question pertinente.\n[20] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s soit accept\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Plainte et requ\u00eate. 1\nII........... La position des parties. 1\nIII......... Ordonnance. 1\nI. Plainte et requ\u00eate [1] Le plaignant, M. Ashok Tiwari, est un agent de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le chez Air Canada. Le 14 septembre 2009, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) fond\u00e9e sur le motif de l\u2019\u00e2ge au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP). En particulier, le plaignant soutient que les intim\u00e9s, son employeur Air Canada et son syndicat, le Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses canadien(ne)s de l\u2019automobile (TCA), ont agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire lorsqu\u2019ils ont mis fin \u00e0 son emploi le premier jour du mois suivant le mois au cours duquel il a eu 65 ans, le 8 septembre 2009, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique de retraite obligatoire pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[2] Le 3 mars 2011, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en obtention d\u2019une ordonnance sur les trois points suivants :\n1) Que le Tribunal conclue que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination de la part des intim\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils ont mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant en raison de son \u00e2ge, en contravention des dispositions de la LCDP;\n2) Que le Tribunal conclue qu\u2019il est li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada c. Kelly, 2011 CF 120 (Kelly), et qu\u2019il conclue que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fense par les intim\u00e9s pour justifier la contravention pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00e0 la LCDP;\n3) Que le Tribunal conclue que le fait de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant constituait une pratique discriminatoire en l\u2019absence de toute autre r\u00e9ponse des intim\u00e9s au sujet de la preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nII. La position des parties [3] La position du plaignant se r\u00e9sume comme suit :\n(a) Les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019entendent sur le fait que la seule raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant \u00e9tait la disposition de retraite obligatoire pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective en cours entre les intim\u00e9s.\n(b) Dans la d\u00e9cision Kelly et dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven c. Air Canada, 2009 CF 367, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP viole le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte) et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 par l\u2019article premier de la Charte; cette d\u00e9cision lie le Tribunal.\n(c) Le fait de juger \u00e0 nouveau la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP par le Tribunal constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure et pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives importantes sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et de l\u2019administration de la justice.\n(d) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penchent en faveur de la pr\u00e9d\u00e9termination par le Tribunal de la possibilit\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s se pr\u00e9valent de la d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n(e) Le TCA n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate officielle en ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure, par cons\u00e9quent, cette requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e correctement au Tribunal.\n(f) Air Canada ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP est inconstitutionnel et Air Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9voit pas pr\u00e9senter de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet.\n(g) Le plaignant accepte toute d\u00e9fense au sujet du bien fond\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) et soutient seulement qu\u2019en raison de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de cet alin\u00e9a, Air Canada ne peut pas se pr\u00e9valoir de cette d\u00e9fense. La requ\u00eate vise seulement \u00e0 \u00e9viter qu\u2019on juge \u00e0 nouveau la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9.\n(h) Rien n\u2019exige qu\u2019il y ait une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 selon laquelle une disposition l\u00e9gale est inop\u00e9rante pour que cette conclusion lie le Tribunal.\n(i) Il n\u2019y a aucune exigence l\u00e9gale ou raison valable pour suspendre l\u2019application de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019entendre et de trancher des affaires semblables au sujet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que toutes les voies d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision Kelly aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9es, en effet, il existe de fortes raisons l\u00e9gales et constitutionnelles de ne pas le faire.\n(j) Par deux fois, Air Canada n\u2019a pu persuader le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet de l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) est inop\u00e9rant.\n(k) Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre des intim\u00e9s ne nient l\u2019affirmation du plaignant au sujet de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; ils soutiennent seulement que la d\u00e9cision ne lie pas le Tribunal.\n(l) Air Canada ne compte pas appeler de t\u00e9moins au sujet de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP. Dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, Air Canada a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quelle serait la conclusion au sujet de la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9. Comme aucune cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a donn\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal pour s\u2019interposer dans les conclusions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9tentions des parties et comme le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour s\u2019interposer dans la d\u00e9cision des deux intim\u00e9s de ne pas d\u00e9poser de d\u00e9fense, de ne pas pr\u00e9senter de preuve et de ne pas contester l\u2019affirmation du plaignant au sujet de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c), le Tribunal ne peut pas examiner ou accepter une d\u00e9fense au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c).\n(m) Le Tribunal doit acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la proc\u00e9dure en concluant, compte tenu de tous les arguments susmentionn\u00e9s par le plaignant, qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une raison valable d\u2019agir autrement, il doit suivre les d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal et de la Cour en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question fondamentale dont il est saisi au sujet de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) et mettre fin \u00e0 ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations au sujet de la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e0 tenir une audience qui ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[4] Air Canada est d\u2019avis que le Tribunal devrait rejeter la requ\u00eate du plaignant pour les motifs suivants :\n(a) Air Canada a le droit fondamental de pr\u00e9senter une pleine d\u00e9fense au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP.\n(b) Les intim\u00e9s peuvent se fonder sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP parce que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que soutient le plaignant, Air Canada a toujours recours \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense.\n(c) La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Vilven c. Air Canada, 2009 TCDP 24, et la d\u00e9cision Kelly de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne servaient pas de d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c).\n(d) En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la Charte, dans Kelly, elle ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux deux pilotes dans cette affaire.\n(e) La retraite obligatoire continue d\u2019\u00eatre permise en vertu de la LCDP.\n(f) En l\u2019absence de l\u2019accueil de la contestation constitutionnelle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP soulev\u00e9e dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il est tout \u00e0 fait possible et appropri\u00e9 pour Air Canada de se fonder sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fense. Le Tribunal peut entendre une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans pour les agents de ventes \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et les agents de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par TCA.\n(g) Air Canada peut, par cons\u00e9quent, se fonder sur l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite comme il l\u2019a fait dans les deux plaintes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par la Commission avant leur renvoi au Tribunal.\n(h) Air Canada soutient que la d\u00e9cision Kelly de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale fait pr\u00e9sentement l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La conclusion du Tribunal au sujet de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP et de l\u2019article premier de la Charte fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le.\n(i) Le plaignant ne peut pas simplement se fonder sur la d\u00e9cision Kelly pour soutenir que les conclusions dans cette d\u00e9cision appuient une conclusion de discrimination prima facie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(j) L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que les intim\u00e9s aient l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8te.\n(k) Les intim\u00e9s ne tentent pas de faire juger \u00e0 nouveau une question qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par les Cours.\n(l) Le plaignant ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e, parce que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli dans son poste et qu\u2019il ne subira pas de dommages continus.\n[5] TCA est d\u2019avis que le Tribunal devrait rejeter la requ\u00eate pour les motifs suivants :\n(a) Le plaignant semble se fonder sur la d\u00e9cision Kelly de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui porte sur la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCPD, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la d\u00e9cision finale des Cours du Canada \u00e0 ce sujet, alors que \u00e7a ne l\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas.\n(b) La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas rendu une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP est inop\u00e9rant en application du paragraphe 52(1) de la Charte.\n(c) TCA, au nom du plaignant et d\u2019autres personnes, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief et une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par l\u2019arbitre Martin Teplitsky dans laquelle il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que toute r\u00e8gle portant sur la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans pour les employ\u00e9s repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le syndicat du TCA est inop\u00e9rante et ill\u00e9gale jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale soit rendue par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada au sujet de la d\u00e9cision Kelly. L\u2019arbitre a ordonn\u00e9 la r\u00e9embauche des employ\u00e9s et le r\u00e9tablissement des employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils avaient atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans, y compris le plaignant.\n(d) En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la doctrine stare decisis, selon laquelle le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision Kelly de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 52(1) est une question th\u00e9orique. TCA a agi apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief au nom du plaignant et a obtenu une ordonnance le r\u00e9tablissant dans ses fonctions en attendant la d\u00e9cision finale de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou de la Cour supr\u00eame.\n(e) TCA souhaite agir de la fa\u00e7on la plus \u00e9conomique et la plus pratique et demande au Tribunal d\u2019ajourner la proc\u00e9dure en attendant une d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision Kelly devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n(f) La seule question \u00e0 trancher est celle de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP.\n(g) Le plaignant ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice puisqu\u2019il sera au travail en attendant le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019affaire.\n(h) TCA ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 payer les dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats tant que le droit n\u2019est pas clair.\nIII. Ordonnance [6] En application du paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner et appliquer la Charte et fournir des redressements pour des violations \u00e0 la Charte conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs que la LCDP lui accorde (voir R c. Conway, 2010 CSC 22). Cependant, aucune disposition de la LCDP ne donne au Tribunal comp\u00e9tence pour faire une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au sujet de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gale qui s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 toutes les plaintes \u00e0 venir. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nouvelle \u00c9cosse (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Martin, 2003 CSC 54 (Martin), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nEn outre, les r\u00e9parations constitutionnelles relevant des tribunaux administratifs sont limit\u00e9es et n\u2019incluent pas les d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal administratif qu\u2019une disposition de sa loi habilitante est invalide au regard de la Charte ne lie pas les d\u00e9cideurs qui se prononceront ult\u00e9rieurement dans le cadre ou en dehors du r\u00e9gime administratif de ce tribunal. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en obtenant d\u2019une cour de justice une d\u00e9claration formelle d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie peut \u00e9tablir, pour l\u2019avenir, l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative.\n(Martin, au paragraphe 31)\n[7] Ces principes ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven c. Air Canada, 2010 TCDP 27, au paragraphe 6, et par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Kelly, au paragraphe 479. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit suivre une approche au cas par cas lorsqu\u2019il examine et qu\u2019il applique la Charte, et le fait d\u2019examiner la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP dans le contexte de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne constituerait pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure ni un nouveau jugement de la d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du Tribunal. Bien que les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce soient semblables \u00e0 ceux de la d\u00e9cision Kelly, les parties ne sont pas les m\u00eames et M. Tiwari est un agent de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et non un pilote. Par cons\u00e9quent, une audience sur le fond doit \u00eatre tenue et des preuves factuelles doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour que le Tribunal puisse tirer une conclusion au sujet de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15 (1)c) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] Le plaignant demande au Tribunal d\u2019accepter sa position au sujet de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) en fonction des documents qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, dont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019Air Canada ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 du plaignant et qu\u2019elle ne planifie pas pr\u00e9senter de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cet argument. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal d\u2019effectuer une deuxi\u00e8me analyse de la plainte qui ressemble \u00e0 celle effectu\u00e9e par la Commission. L\u2019extrait suivant est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur :\nIl est vrai que, dans Cremasco et al. c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, D\u00e9cision no I, 2002\/09\/30 (confirm\u00e9e par Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 (CanLII), 2004 CF 81), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir du Tribunal, en tant que ma\u00eetre de ses propres proc\u00e9dures, de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019abus de ces proc\u00e9dures en rejetant une affaire vieille de huit ans qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet de deux arbitrages et d\u2019une plainte distincte devant la Commission (Cremasco, au paragraphe 14). Cependant, m\u00eame si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans ces circonstances, cela ne permet pas de conclure que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rejeter des plaintes au motif que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent aucune preuve prima facie. \u00c0 mon avis, si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu que le Tribunal exerce ce que l\u2019on pourrait essentiellement consid\u00e9rer comme une deuxi\u00e8me fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision initiale de la Commission en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi, il lui aurait confi\u00e9 le pouvoir l\u00e9gal explicite de le faire.\n(Harkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2009 TCDP 6 (Harkin), au paragraphe 21, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[9] Les expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions et les pr\u00e9tentions des parties devraient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme la seule preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour confirmer le bien fond\u00e9 du point de vue d\u2019une partie. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les parties peuvent appeler des t\u00e9moins et pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres arguments qui expliquent plus en profondeur ce qu\u2019ils ont bri\u00e8vement \u00e9tabli dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Une divulgation compl\u00e8te des documents assure qu\u2019aucune partie n\u2019est prise par surprise \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais il ne s\u2019agit pas du dernier mot des parties. L\u2019audience est aussi une occasion pour le membre pr\u00e9sidant de poser des questions et d\u2019observer et d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moins. Enfin, le Tribunal doit s\u2019assurer que toutes les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00eatre entendues de fa\u00e7on juste et impartiale. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Harkin :\nIl ne faut pas non plus oublier que le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi accorde aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. J\u2019admets que le juge von Finckenstein, dans Cremasco, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans les cas o\u00f9 il est \u00e9vident que les parties ont, en effet, \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues dans le cadre d\u2019une autre instance, le Tribunal a le droit de rejeter la plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience. Toutefois, le Tribunal fait preuve d\u2019une grande prudence avant de rejeter une plainte pour ce motif; voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. et al. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 26; O\u2019Connor c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 5. Il doit \u00eatre clair que les parties ont v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues et que les questions en litige ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement dans le cadre de l\u2019autre instance.\n(Harkin, au paragraphe 22).\n[10] De plus, dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada, Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res nations c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 4 (APN), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nL\u2019obligation de proc\u00e9der sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive qui est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 48.9(2) de la LCDP est sujette \u00e0 deux limites importantes : les principes de justice naturelle et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en date du 3 mai 2004 (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure).\n(APN, au paragraphe 33)\n[11] Air Canada souhaite pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8te et y a droit conform\u00e9ment aux principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et conform\u00e9ment aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. \u00c0 ce sujet, le plaignant doit respecter le choix de proc\u00e9dure que le Tribunal a mis en place :\nFinalement, il faut tenir compte des choix de proc\u00e9dure que le Tribunal fait lui-m\u00eame, particuli\u00e8rement quand la Loi lui laisse la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir sa propre proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a une expertise dans le choix de la proc\u00e9dure appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances. En ce qui concerne ce dernier aspect, les membres du Tribunal sont nomm\u00e9s en raison de leurs comp\u00e9tences, de leur exp\u00e9rience et du fait qu\u2019ils sont sensibilis\u00e9s aux droits de la personne (LCDP, paragraphe 48.1(2)). De plus, pour les affaires instruites au moyen d\u2019une audience viva voce, il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que le l\u00e9gislateur a express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux membres le pouvoir de statuer sur toute question de proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019elles soul\u00e8vent (LCDP, alin\u00e9a 50(3)e)).\n(APN, au paragraphe 48)\n[12] Le Tribunal a mis en place de nouvelles initiatives qui peuvent aider les parties \u00e0 acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l\u2019affaire de fa\u00e7on \u00e9conomique. Ces initiatives visent \u00e0 atteindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice dans les param\u00e8tres de la justice naturelle. Il existe de nombreuses fa\u00e7ons proactives de traiter des questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sans emp\u00eacher les intim\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter leur d\u00e9fense. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une gestion active d\u2019instance, les questions peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es afin de r\u00e9duire la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience. On peut s\u2019entendre sur les faits, les questions en litige et les questions de droit qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s conjointement. Une m\u00e9diation sur les proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre, avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un membre du Tribunal, peut \u00eatre une solution pour se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019exemples de fa\u00e7ons, si les parties y conviennent, dont les parties peuvent utiliser leurs ressources de fa\u00e7on efficace sans emp\u00eacher les intim\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter la d\u00e9fense qu\u2019ils souhaitent soulever.\n[13] TCA a demand\u00e9 un ajournement, mais il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de requ\u00eate officielle d\u2019ajournement.

Garfield\nDate : Le 14 octobre 2011\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2011 TCDP 17\nIntroduction\n[1] Voici mes motifs de d\u00e9cision visant les deux requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par tous les plaignants repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Hall (qui se sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme la \u00ab coalition de plaignants \u00bb) au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9, concernant l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des deux intim\u00e9es \u2013 Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (l\u2019Association).\nL\u2019instance principale\n[2] L\u2019instance principale porte sur les plaintes de pilotes retrait\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada qui soutiennent qu\u2019Air Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire et a appliqu\u00e9 une politique discriminatoire en les obligeant \u00e0 prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Cette obligation \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre Air Canada et l\u2019agent des n\u00e9gociations, soit l\u2019Association, et conforme au r\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces pilotes retrait\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes conjointes contre l\u2019Association, plaintes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9es en une seule audience devant le Tribunal. Les pilotes soutiennent que l\u2019obligation de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans contrevient aux articles 7, 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116, modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP).\n[3] Lors de la premi\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance, sur consentement des parties, j\u2019ai disjoint l\u2019instance en deux \u00e9tapes, l\u2019une de responsabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019autre de r\u00e9paration. En date des pr\u00e9sents motifs, d\u2019autres plaintes de pilotes retrait\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada portant sur les m\u00eames questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) au Tribunal. La pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal m\u2019a nomm\u00e9 comme membre instructeur pour ces plaintes. Il y a maintenant un total de 164 plaintes (82 plaignants) dans le groupe de plaintes portant l\u2019intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Bailie et al. \u00bb. Les plaignants sont tous repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat Raymond D. Hall (qui est aussi un plaignant), sauf pour un plaignant qui se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame, Eric Rogers.\nLa requ\u00eate au sujet de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada\n[4] La coalition de plaignants demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance exigeant qu\u2019Air Canada signifie [traduction] \u00ab un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions plus complet \u00bb en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense portant sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, y compris au sujet de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019accommodement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive \u00bb. Cette requ\u00eate comprend une [traduction] \u00ab description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e \u00bb de la preuve sur laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e entend se fonder.\n[5] Subsidiairement, si Air Canada est incapable d\u2019\u00e9tablir dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate [traduction] \u00ab en droit et dans la preuve qu\u2019elle propose de pr\u00e9senter \u00bb une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, les plaignants me demandent de radier tous les paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada qui portent sur la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[6] La coalition de plaignants me demande aussi de rendre une ordonnance radiant 12 autres paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les paragraphes 19 et 20, 37 et 38, 40, et 48 \u00e0 54. Certains de ces paragraphes portent sur la d\u00e9fense d\u2019Air Canada en mati\u00e8re d\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, et sur d\u2019autres faits, qui ne se rapportent pas \u00e0 cette d\u00e9fense. Les parties requ\u00e9rantes ajoutent en r\u00e9serve [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019Air Canada puisse r\u00e9tablir toute d\u00e9fense qu\u2019elle souhaite pr\u00e9senter [\u2026] tant que cette d\u00e9fense est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on suffisamment pr\u00e9cise [\u2026] \u00bb.\nLes motifs de la requ\u00eate\n[7] De nombreux documents portant sur la requ\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Je reformulerai et condenserai ci-dessous les motifs et les arguments afin d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel.\n[8] Les parties requ\u00e9rantes soutiennent qu\u2019Air Canada a d\u00e9natur\u00e9, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la question principale dont le Tribunal est saisi. Elle aurait soutenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019abolition de la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans pour ses pilotes. [traduction] \u00ab La seule question dont le Tribunal est saisi est celle de savoir si la cessation d\u2019emploi de chaque plaignant a constitu\u00e9 une pratique discriminatoire en date de la fin d\u2019emploi de chaque plaignant \u00bb. Non seulement l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada d\u00e9nature les questions en litige, mais la coalition de plaignants soutient aussi qu\u2019Air Canada tente [traduction] \u00ab de soulever dans sa preuve et dans ses arguments des questions qui ne sont absolument pas pertinentes quant aux questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb. Une grande partie de cet argument est fond\u00e9e sur la qualification de la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[9] Quant \u00e0 la radiation des paragraphes 19 et 20, 37 et 38, 40, et 48 \u00e0 54, les parties requ\u00e9rantes soutiennent que l\u2019information qui y para\u00eet n\u2019a aucun lien avec les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi ou que cette information est th\u00e9orique. De tels arguments ou preuves [traduction] \u00ab entra\u00eeneraient un gaspillage des ressources limit\u00e9es et pr\u00e9cieuses du Tribunal et constitueraient un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[10] Air Canada soutient que la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, si j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u2019avis que la requ\u00eate des parties requ\u00e9rantes \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, Air Canada soutient que je devrais ordonner la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaire, plut\u00f4t que de prendre des [traduction] \u00ab mesures de redressement excessives \u00bb comme la radiation de certaines parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, qui emp\u00eacheraient Air Canada de pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9ponse et une d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8tes aux plaintes.\n[11] Air Canada soutient qu\u2019elle a clairement avis\u00e9 les autres parties de ses moyens de d\u00e9fense, y compris la nature de la preuve sur laquelle elle souhaite se fonder. Les parties requ\u00e9rantes demandent \u00e0 tort des d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires de la preuve par rapport \u00e0 ce qui est normalement exig\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, Air Canada soutient qu\u2019elle a enti\u00e8rement satisfait aux exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[12] Air Canada soutient que les parties requ\u00e9rantes lui demandent \u00e0 tort [traduction] \u00ab de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019avance, avant l\u2019audience, toute la preuve qui sera produite \u00e0 ce moment \u00bb. La requ\u00eate des plaignants n\u2019est pas r\u00e9ellement une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir plus de pr\u00e9cisions, [traduction] \u00ab mais est plut\u00f4t une contestation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des faits m\u00eames. De telles contestations doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es lors de l\u2019audience, lorsque les deux parties peuvent mettre \u00e0 \u00e9preuve la preuve de l\u2019autre et pr\u00e9senter des observations quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de cette preuve \u00bb.\n[13] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la troisi\u00e8me formation du Tribunal \u00e0 traiter de la politique de retraite obligatoire des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. En effet, deux formations ont r\u00e9cemment rendu des d\u00e9cisions : Vilven\/Kelly, 2011 TCDP 10, et Thwaites, 2011 TCDP 11 (un contr\u00f4le judiciaire des deux d\u00e9cisions est en cours). Des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes ont aussi fait l\u2019objet de contr\u00f4les judiciaires devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il existe pr\u00e9sentement des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et une demande de pourvoi devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Air Canada souligne aussi que la coalition de plaignants est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le m\u00eame avocat que les plaignants dans les autres instances portant sur la retraite obligatoire de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada devant le Tribunal (et devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel). Il n\u2019y a aucune surprise dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada.\nAnalyse\nFournir de meilleures pr\u00e9cisions : Objectif et port\u00e9e de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions\n[14] L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (les R\u00e8gles) porte sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la divulgation et la production. Il \u00e9tablit que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de chaque partie doit comprendre :\n(1) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause;\n(2) sa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause;\n(3) le redressement recherch\u00e9;\n(4) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession, pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 ou non;\n(5) les noms des divers t\u00e9moins \u2013 autres que les t\u00e9moins experts \u2013 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux (ou \u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 \u00bb).\nLe paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles exige que les parties produisent une copie des documents et la signifient \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie, mais elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 les d\u00e9poser au Tribunal. Le paragraphe 6(5) impose une obligation continue de divulgation et de production aux parties.\n[15] Quel est l\u2019objet de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de? Cette r\u00e8gle vise \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 chacune des parties de pr\u00e9senter avec efficacit\u00e9 ses dossiers respectifs et \u00e0 aider le Tribunal \u00e0 g\u00e9rer de fa\u00e7on efficace l\u2019instance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une audience juste et efficace, annulant le besoin d\u2019effectuer des ajournements en raison de \u00ab surprises \u00bb. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions est plus complet que le plaidoyer dans une instance civile devant la Cour. L\u2019expos\u00e9 doit contenir plus que ce qu\u2019on retrouverait dans une demande introductive d\u2019instance et dans une d\u00e9fense dans une instance civile, mais doit aussi comprendre une liste des documents (semblable \u00e0 un affidavit de documents), une liste des t\u00e9moins et un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u00e9cessite une assertion de faits, et ne n\u00e9cessite pas le fait de plaider des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L\u2019expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre un m\u00e9moire. En effet, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 contenir un compte rendu exhaustif du t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, mais plut\u00f4t, les principales questions que le t\u00e9moin abordera, afin que l\u2019autre partie puisse pr\u00e9parer son contre-interrogatoire et son dossier en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nQu\u2019est CE qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 ou produit \u00e0 ce jour?\n[16] Il y a eu une divulgation et une production exhaustive \u00e0 ce jour. Premi\u00e8rement, les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Je crois comprendre qu\u2019il y a certains probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 la divulgation de certains documents qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s ni produits. La Commission a signifi\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son [traduction] \u00ab ensemble de documents \u00bb exhaustifs de 45 pages comportant les [traduction] \u00ab fruits de son enqu\u00eate \u00bb. Les listes des t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies \u00e0 divers degr\u00e9s et les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s du t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre produits. Bien entendu, le Tribunal ne re\u00e7oit aucune copie des documents produits. Toute question pendante quant \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 la production sera trait\u00e9e lors de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance \u00e0 venir \u00e0 Ottawa.\n[17] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre prise dans le contexte plus large des dossiers pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de retraite obligatoire des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi et des demandes pass\u00e9es et pr\u00e9sentes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et de pourvoi portant sur ces dossiers devant les Cours. Une partie de la divulgation et de la production en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comprend les productions volumineuses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites avant l\u2019audience et la preuve de vive voix et la preuve documentaire, ainsi que les arguments, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors des audiences dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites devant le Tribunal. De plus, il y a aussi les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans les deux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire r\u00e9solues devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, y compris le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ainsi que les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et de pourvoi en cours devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[18] De plus, comme le mentionne Air Canada, l\u2019avocat des parties requ\u00e9rantes, Me Hall, \u00e9tait aussi l\u2019avocat dans les dossiers pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents semblables devant le Tribunal et les cours. Il y a un chevauchement important dans les questions et la preuve : la coalition de plaignants mentionne dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, \u00e0 la page 18, [traduction] \u00ab deux audiences pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes identiques \u00bb. En effet, au paragraphe 13 de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, il est \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la portion de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience, les plaignants s\u2019attendent \u00e0 se fonder sur la preuve et l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s tant dans l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire Vilven\u2011Kelly que dans celle de l\u2019affaire Thwaites \u00bb.\n[19] Air Canada soutient que Me Hall et le reste des parties requ\u00e9rantes ne peuvent pas soutenir qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de [traduction] \u00ab surprises \u00bb ou de \u00ab pi\u00e8ges \u00bb. La position d\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9. Je suis d\u2019accord. J\u2019ai lu l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de 15 pages d\u2019Air Canada et sa r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des pr\u00e9cisions dans les documents de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Je suis convaincu que les parties requ\u00e9rantes ont suffisamment d\u2019information pour pr\u00e9parer leur preuve prima facie et pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e d\u2019Air Canada. Elles n\u2019ont pas besoin de pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate des parties requ\u00e9rantes en obtention de pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires est rejet\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai donc pas \u00e0 trancher leur demande subsidiaire de radiation des parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada qui portent sur la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Cependant, il me reste encore \u00e0 trancher leur demande de redressement au paragraphe 3 de leur avis de requ\u00eate : c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la radiation des paragraphes 19 et 20, 37 et 38, 40 et 48 \u00e0 54 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada.\nArguments quant \u00e0 la radiation : Dispositions l\u00e9gales et jurisprudence\n[20] La LCDP et les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ne pr\u00e9voient pas express\u00e9ment la radiation de notre version d\u2019un plaidoyer \u2013 soit l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. En effet, dans Harkin c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, 2009 TCDP 6, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner une telle radiation et que la radiation d\u2019un plaidoyer ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la cat\u00e9gorie tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite de rejet avant l\u2019audience expliqu\u00e9e par le juge von Finckenstein dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 (Cremasco). L\u2019affaire Harkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, portait sur la requ\u00eate d\u2019un intim\u00e9 visant \u00e0 radier le plaidoyer parce que le plaignant n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties requ\u00e9rantes sont les plaignants et, bien entendu, elles ne souhaitent pas la radiation d\u2019une partie du plaidoyer pour d\u00e9faut d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. Dans Harkin, le Tribunal a conclu subsidiairement que les faits de l\u2019affaire ne satisfaisaient m\u00eame pas au crit\u00e8re du caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb qui existe dans les cours civiles tel qu\u2019\u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hunt c. Carey, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 959.\n[21] La pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 4 (contr\u00f4le judiciaire en instance), a conclu que la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas une liste exhaustive quant au rejet avant l\u2019audience d\u2019une plainte, mais elle a aussi fait une mise en garde au paragraphe 60 en ce qui a trait au crit\u00e8re du caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hunt c. Carey : \u00ab J\u2019adh\u00e8re aux propos de la Couronne, qui avance qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 d\u2019importer dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif de la LCDP des crit\u00e8res appliqu\u00e9s par les tribunaux civils, dont les fondations juridiques sont fort diff\u00e9rentes. \u00bb Je suis du m\u00eame avis : le Tribunal doit agir avec pr\u00e9caution lorsqu\u2019il examine la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019importer de tels crit\u00e8res.\n[22] Le Tribunal devrait peut-\u00eatre examiner les crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux et les pratiques des autres tribunaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du Canada avant de se fonder sur ceux des cours. Il existe des raisons politiques solides pour lesquelles les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ne contiennent que dix articles, alors que les R\u00e8gles des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales comptent plus de 500 articles. Notamment, il existe aussi un fondement l\u00e9gal, parce que le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que : \u00ab l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. (Voir aussi l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.)\n[23] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019approche suivie par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Harkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, j\u2019examinerai maintenant si le crit\u00e8re du caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation des douze paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada, tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 3 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate. Certains de ces paragraphes portent sur la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e d\u2019Air Canada, d\u2019autres sont des faits qui fournissent un contexte et un historique de la retraite obligatoire des pilotes et des conditions d\u2019emploi des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 ces parties pr\u00e9cises et je conclus qu\u2019elles satisfont au crit\u00e8re peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 requis afin d\u2019\u00eatre inclus de fa\u00e7on correcte dans un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[24] Quant aux all\u00e9gations des parties requ\u00e9rantes selon lesquelles ces paragraphes [traduction] \u00ab entra\u00eeneraient un gaspillage des ressources limit\u00e9es et pr\u00e9cieuses du Tribunal et constitueraient un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, cela soul\u00e8ve la question plus large de l\u2019instance au complet. La requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas le mode appropri\u00e9 pour traiter un argument en mati\u00e8re d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, pi\u00e8ce par pi\u00e8ce, en ce qui a trait aux paragraphes pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada.\n[25] \u00c0 tout le moins, compte tenu des commentaires des parties dans leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions respectifs et dans les documents portant sur la requ\u00eate, une question s\u00e9rieuse est soulev\u00e9e au sujet du fait de juger des questions \u00e0 nouveau dans l\u2019instance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce qui invoque les doctrines de la chose jug\u00e9e, de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige, de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, etc. Par exemple, \u00e0 la page 11 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate des parties requ\u00e9rantes, on peut lire entre autres :\n[traduction]\nLes questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont tr\u00e8s semblables, sinon identiques, aux questions que le Tribunal a tranch\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\u2011Kelly et dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites. Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait du fait que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le Tribunal [elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue depuis : 2011 TCDP 11], il serait juste de dire que toutes les questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues et tranch\u00e9es par le Tribunal et que la pr\u00e9sente audience pourrait ne pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire.\n[26] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles avaient l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en rejet pour abus de proc\u00e9dure. La coalition de plaignants a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle attendrait la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce avant de se prononcer. La Commission a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab ne d\u00e9poserait pas une requ\u00eate distincte [en abus de proc\u00e9dure], mais qu\u2019elle s\u2019opposerait \u00e0 toute tentative de pr\u00e9senter des preuves qui pourraient contredire les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly] \u00bb. Cette question sera trait\u00e9e \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance \u00e0 venir.\nLa requ\u00eate portant sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019Association\n[27] La coalition de plaignants demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la radiation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a d) de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019Association, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la section intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Les dispositions de la convention collective qui exigent la retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans constituent\u2011elles une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e? \u00bb\nLes motifs de la requ\u00eate\n[28] Les parties requ\u00e9rantes soutiennent qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) pour une pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e que si elle est \u00e9tablie par un employeur. Un agent n\u00e9gociateur ne peut pas en profiter. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019Association ne peut pas pr\u00e9senter une telle d\u00e9fense et tout argument \u00e0 ce sujet devrait \u00eatre radi\u00e9. De plus, m\u00eame si un non-employeur pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019une telle d\u00e9fense, les parties requ\u00e9rantes soutiennent que la disposition de la convention collective qui porte sur une telle obligation n\u2019est pas une exigence professionnelle, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019agit simplement d\u2019une exigence d\u2019Air Canada et de l\u2019Association. [traduction] \u00ab Transports Canada, l\u2019organe de r\u00e9glementation qui \u00e9tablit les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles pertinentes pour les pilotes au Canada ne pr\u00e9voit aucun \u00e2ge maximal pour les permis de pilotes. \u00bb\nLa r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019Association\n[29] L\u2019Association r\u00e9pond que les parties requ\u00e9rantes l\u2019emp\u00eachent \u00e0 tort de pr\u00e9parer une d\u00e9fense aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es contre l\u2019Association. Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e ne s\u2019offre qu\u2019\u00e0 un employeur, l\u2019Association r\u00e9pond que [traduction] \u00ab la proposition ne respecte pas les dispositions de la Loi et les obligations d\u2019accommodement que la Loi impose aux organisations d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00bb. L\u2019Association cite l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970. L\u2019Association soutient aussi que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment tranch\u00e9e en sa faveur par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Thwaites, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 336 \u00e0 340.\n[30] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de ce que constitue une \u00ab exigence professionnelle \u00bb, l\u2019Association soutient que les arguments des plaignants sont [traduction] \u00ab sans fondement \u00bb parce que, selon la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat BC Public Service Employee Relations Comm. c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1993] 3 R.C.S 3 (Meiorin), [traduction] \u00ab la \u00ab norme \u00bb, \u00ab r\u00e8gle \u00bb ou \u00ab exigence professionnelle \u00bb en est une qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par un employeur et qui n\u2019est pas impos\u00e9e par une loi [\u2026] La \u00ab r\u00e8gle ou norme \u00bb qui est en question dans les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi en est une qui pr\u00e9voit la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Cela est clairement d\u00e9fini dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions [\u2026] \u00bb. L\u2019Association soutient que cela a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment par deux formations diff\u00e9rentes du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et l\u2019affaire Thwaites, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, respectivement.\nAnalyse\n[31] Je souscris aux observations de l\u2019Association. En ce qui a trait aux deux questions \u00e0 savoir si la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e par un employeur (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019Association) et celle de savoir s\u2019il existe une exigence professionnelle au sens de la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, les positions des deux parties requ\u00e9rantes et de l\u2019Association sont d\u00e9fendables. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles devront \u00eatre d\u00e9battues \u00e0 l\u2019audience apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve. La d\u00e9fense plausible de l\u2019Association ne devrait pas \u00eatre radi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des arguments, \u00e0 supposer que le Tribunal a m\u00eame le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de radier cette d\u00e9fense.\n[32] De plus, le crit\u00e8re du caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli parce que l\u2019assertion des parties requ\u00e9rantes selon laquelle une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e n\u2019est ouverte qu\u2019\u00e0 un employeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e auparavant et que le Tribunal l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 336 \u00e0 340. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019autre question, dans les deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes du Tribunal dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, chacune des deux formations respectives, bien qu\u2019elles ne se soient pas entendues \u00e0 savoir si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, se sont n\u00e9anmoins entendues \u00e0 savoir que la disposition de la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans \u00e9tait une norme de travail et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait donc une \u00ab exigence professionnelle \u00bb. Une fois de plus, cela soul\u00e8ve la question plus large de la remise en cause de questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par le Tribunal.\nConclusion\n[33] Compte tenu des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, les deux requ\u00eates sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMatthew D.

Questions examin\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence [1] Le matin du 18 novembre 2005, Teiohontathe Fallan Davis (Teiohontathe) revenait chez elle des \u00c9tats-Unis. Elle \u00e9tait seule, conduisant un vieux v\u00e9hicule utilitaire sport (VUS) noir. Teiohontathe s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall \u00e0 Cornwall (Ontario) de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC), o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait bien connue des agents de l\u2019ASFC parce qu\u2019elle est r\u00e9sidente de la r\u00e9serve Akwesasne et qu\u2019elle voyage souvent, traversant la fronti\u00e8re plusieurs fois par jour.\n[2] L\u2019ASFC est un organisme \u00e9tabli par la Loi sur l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (la loi sur l\u2019ASFC). Son mandat est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la loi sur l\u2019ASFC :\n5.

La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est un examen primaire lors duquel un agent de l\u2019ASFC pose des questions pr\u00e9liminaires au voyageur, apr\u00e8s lesquelles on peut permettre au voyageur de continuer sa route. Cependant, si l\u2019agent d\u00e9termine, en fonction des exigences des douanes ou de l\u2019immigration, qu\u2019un examen plus approfondi est n\u00e9cessaire, il renvoie le voyageur \u00e0 un autre agent pour un deuxi\u00e8me examen.\n[4] Teiohontathe a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen primaire rapide, suivi d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me examen tr\u00e8s long, au cours duquel elle a d\u00fb rester debout \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur alors qu\u2019il faisait tr\u00e8s froid, pendant que son VUS \u00e9tait balay\u00e9 par le syst\u00e8me mobile d\u2019inspection des v\u00e9hicules et du fret (VACIS), et pendant que plusieurs agents ont fouill\u00e9 son VUS par la suite. \u00c0 la fin de ce processus d\u2019examen primaire et secondaire, le VUS de Teiohontathe lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu et elle a pu entrer au Canada.\n[5] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019ASFC d\u00e9clare que le VUS de Teiohontathe a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab vis\u00e9 par une inspection de routine \u00bb avec l\u2019aide du VACIS, et aussi que son VUS \u00e9tait le type de v\u00e9hicule qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 pour inspection ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 par un agent du renseignement de l\u2019ASFC en raison d\u2019une inspection r\u00e9cente d\u2019un VUS qui avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 un compartiment secret qui pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour de la contrebande.\n[6] Dans une plainte qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), Teiohontathe a soutenu que les agents de l\u2019ASFC ont fait preuve de profilage racial et ont enfreint ses droits au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personnes (la LCDP) en la visant pour une deuxi\u00e8me inspection avec le VACIS, et qu\u2019en raison de sa race, de son \u00e2ge ou de son sexe, elle a fait l\u2019objet de soup\u00e7ons ou d\u2019agression accrus et a subi des commentaires d\u00e9gradants insultants et de nature raciste.\n[7] Le membre R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a instruit la plainte de Teiohontathe pendant les p\u00e9riodes allant du 30 novembre au 4 d\u00e9cembre et du 14 d\u00e9cembre au 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009, mais il n\u2019a pas termin\u00e9 l\u2019instruction. Le membre B\u00e9langer a suspendu l\u2019audience en raison de l\u2019argument de l\u2019ASFC selon lequel il faisait preuve de partialit\u00e9 d\u00e9montrable envers la plaignante et qu\u2019il devrait se r\u00e9cuser. Une requ\u00eate officielle de l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue le 13 octobre 2010 et, le 28 mars 2011, le membre B\u00e9langer a rendu une d\u00e9cision rejetant la requ\u00eate.

La nation Akwesasne chevauche la fronti\u00e8re du Canada et des \u00c9tats-Unis, la pla\u00e7ant sous plusieurs comp\u00e9tences, celles de l\u2019Ontario et du Qu\u00e9bec au Canada, et celle de l\u2019\u00c9tat de New York aux \u00c9tats-Unis, entra\u00eenant pour le peuple Akwesasne de nombreuses travers\u00e9es des fronti\u00e8res. Teiohontathe traverse la fronti\u00e8re de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, parfois jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 fois par jour, lorsqu\u2019elle am\u00e8ne sa fille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, qu\u2019elle visite des membres de sa famille, qu\u2019elle s\u2019occupe de ses affaires personnelles et lorsqu\u2019elle m\u00e8ne ses activit\u00e9s.\n[11] Dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019ASFC reconna\u00eet que [traduction] \u00ab le point d\u2019entr\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall est situ\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9serve Mohawk d\u2019Akwesasne. Environ 80 % des voyageurs qui traversent la fronti\u00e8re \u00e0 cet endroit sont des r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve d\u2019Akwesasne. \u00c0 la demande de la collectivit\u00e9 Mohawk, l\u2019une des voies de circulation situ\u00e9e au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall (la voie d\u2019inspection primaire 4 ou P4) est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e pour l\u2019utilisation exclusive des r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9serve d\u2019Akwesasne et est ouverte lors des moments les plus achaland\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[12] La Commission \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate et elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019interaction de l\u2019ASFC avec Teiohontathe au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e de Cornwall le 18 novembre 2005 constituait des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et, par cons\u00e9quent, que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte. Teiohontathe a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019argument de la Commission au sujet de la question de la comp\u00e9tence.\n[13] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[14] L\u2019article 3 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[15] L\u2019ASFC soutient que le terme \u00ab services \u00bb sous-entend qu\u2019un avantage est offert \u00e0 titre de services au public et que les actions d\u2019application de la loi telles que celles entreprises par les agents de l\u2019ASFC aupr\u00e8s de Teiohontathe ne constituaient pas des services parce qu\u2019elles ne sont pas offertes au public et qu\u2019elles ne sont pas le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un processus qui a lieu dans le contexte d\u2019une relation publique.\n[16] L\u2019ASFC cite l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170, \u00e0 titre de jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position et mentionne en particulier les paragraphes 31, 33 et 34 :\n[31] Sur ce point, je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que, comme les mesures du gouvernement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prises au profit du public, l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9es au public \u00bb est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires mettant en cause une discrimination attribuable \u00e0 des mesures prises par le gouvernement (voir, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions Rosin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 11, et Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission c. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) , (1988), 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253, aux p. 266\u2011268). Toutefois, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir lorsqu\u2019on applique l\u2019article 5 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s constituent des \u00ab services \u00bb (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 60). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les \u00ab services \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 s\u2019entendent de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u00ab offert \u00bb ou \u00ab mis \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb du public (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 55). Or, comment pourrait-on pr\u00e9tendre que des mesures visant \u00e0 faire respecter la loi sont \u00ab offertes \u00bb ou \u00ab mises \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb du public, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019elles ne s'inscrivent pas \u00ab dans le cadre d'une relation publique \u00bb (idem, le juge Iacobucci, au paragraphe 16). Je conclus donc que les mesures d\u2019application de la loi en litige dans le cas qui nous occupe ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5.\n[33] Il faut tenir compte des actes pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination pour pouvoir d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit de \u00ab services \u00bb (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge Iacobucci, au paragraphe 16, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 60), et du fait que les mesures prises par un organisme public pour le bien du public ne peuvent transformer en un service ce qui de toute \u00e9vidence ne l\u2019est pas. \u00c0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre des \u00ab services \u00bb, les mesures prises par le gouvernement ne tombent pas sous le coup de l\u2019article 5. Attendu que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, les mesures d\u2019application de la loi qui font l\u2019objet de la plainte ne constituent pas des \u00ab services \u00bb et ce, peu importe le sens que l\u2019on attribue \u00e0 ce mot, la Commission n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur la plainte.\n[34] Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, j\u2019ai constamment tenu compte du fait que la Loi, qui est vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la promotion et \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense des droits de la personne, doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique afin d\u2019en maximiser la port\u00e9e. Il ne s\u2019agit cependant pas de donner au mot \u00ab services \u00bb une interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse pour atteindre cet objectif; on ne doit pas attribuer \u00e0 ce mot un sens qu\u2019il ne peut recevoir (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 50, et le juge Iacobucci, au paragraphe 13).\n[17] Je conclus que les paragraphes 31, 33 et 34 doivent \u00eatre lus dans le contexte du paragraphe 22 :\n[22] \u00c0 mon avis, en appliquant la Loi sur les aliments et drogues de la mani\u00e8re qui lui est reproch\u00e9e, Sant\u00e9 Canada ne fournissait pas des \u00ab services \u2026 destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5. Les agissements en question sont des mesures coercitives destin\u00e9es \u00e0 assurer le respect de la Loi. Le fait que ces mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public n\u2019en fait pas des \u00ab services \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[18] L\u2019avocat de la Commission a soutenu que l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin n\u2019est pas contraignant. Ses arguments peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi :\n\u2022 L\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin laisse entendre que des mesures d\u2019application de la loi dans d\u2019autres cas pourraient constituer des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Watkin, au paragraphe 31 : \u00ab Je conclus donc que les mesures d\u2019application de la loi en litige dans le cas qui nous occupe ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n\u2022 La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas cit\u00e9 ou mentionn\u00e9 le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise dans sa discussion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des activit\u00e9s d\u2019application de la loi et cette diff\u00e9rence critique limite l\u2019application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin.\n\u2022 La relation entre Teiohontathe et l\u2019ASFC est qualitativement diff\u00e9rente de celle des parties dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Teiohontathe soutient qu\u2019elle doit, de fa\u00e7on routini\u00e8re, traverser la fronti\u00e8re afin de poursuivre les activit\u00e9s normales de sa vie de tous les jours et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a une [traduction] \u00ab relation publique \u00bb continue avec l\u2019ASFC puisqu\u2019elle a des interactions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res face-\u00e0-face avec les agents de l\u2019ASFC, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 fois par jour. Les relations de ce type sont celles qui rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e des \u00ab services \u00bb.\n\u2022 Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commenc\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision en faisant le commentaire pr\u00e9liminaire suivant : \u00ab [\u2026] je signale qu\u2019il est difficile de d\u00e9celer dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant une authentique all\u00e9gation de violation des droits de la personne, car elle semble motiv\u00e9e par des mobiles purement commerciaux \u00bb. Par contraste, la situation de Teiohontathe est exactement le type de situations pour lesquelles les protections en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es et, si la requ\u00eate de l\u2019ASFC est accueillie et que la plainte de Teiohontathe est rejet\u00e9e pour d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence, le r\u00e9sultat sera que les personnes qui subissent des insultes raciales et d\u2019autres types de discriminations lorsqu\u2019elles traversent la fronti\u00e8re n\u2019auront plus de recours en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, un r\u00e9sultat tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux qui ne devrait \u00eatre impos\u00e9 que si le l\u00e9gislateur modifie la LCDP ou la loi sur l\u2019ASFC afin d\u2019ajouter un libell\u00e9 clair qui entra\u00eene une telle conclusion.\n[19] Je suis convaincu que la qualification des mesures d\u2019application de la loi de Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 titre de \u00ab [\u2026] mesures coercitives destin\u00e9es \u00e0 assurer le respect de la loi \u00bb limite l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin \u00e0 ses propres faits. Bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin puisse \u00eatre persuasif, il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[20] Tenant compte du fait que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini la signification d\u2019\u00ab application de la loi \u00bb, je dois examiner si les agents de l\u2019ASFC qui effectuent des examens primaires et secondaires des voyageurs et de leurs v\u00e9hicules fournissent des \u00ab services \u00bb dans le cadre de leur mandat de fournir des \u00ab services frontaliers int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[21] Ce faisant, je tiens compte du fait que l\u2019ASFC a le mandat d\u2019administrer les \u00ab lois relatives aux programmes \u00bb, en particulier la Loi sur les douanes, qui implique in\u00e9vitablement le recouvrement des taxes appropri\u00e9es sur les biens aupr\u00e8s des citoyens et des entreprises respectueux de la loi. La Loi sur les douanes \u00e9tablit une relation dynamique entre le public et les agents de l\u2019ASFC dans un processus complet. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape initiale des examens primaire et secondaire, les agents de l\u2019ASFC doivent faciliter l\u2019entr\u00e9e au Canada des voyageurs respectueux de la loi et de tous les biens qu\u2019ils importent. En s\u2019acquittant de cette t\u00e2che, les agents de l\u2019ASFC ont un devoir adjuvant de traiter de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e les fraudeurs de taxes ou de droits, ce qui peut comprendre la saisie, la confiscation ou des amendes.\n[22] Cependant, si ce processus routinier pr\u00e9sente des circonstances qui \u00e9tablissent un soup\u00e7on, pour des motifs raisonnables, qu\u2019un voyageur est en possession de biens ou de substances illicites, alors l\u2019agent doit agir conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la partie VI de la Loi sur les douanes. La partie VI est intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Contr\u00f4le d\u2019application, pouvoirs des agents \u00bb et elle pr\u00e9voit le processus \u00e0 suivre lors de la fouille d\u2019un voyageur.\n[23] Dans le cas de voyageurs qui introduisent des biens illicites ou des substances ill\u00e9gales, les agents de l\u2019ASFC doivent suivre les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans le Code criminel et la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[24] Ce qui est plus important que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, c\u2019est l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de base envers les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC. Les Canadiens d\u00e9pendent des agents de l\u2019ASFC pour faciliter l\u2019entr\u00e9e au Canada de tous les voyageurs l\u00e9gitimes, tout en interdisant l\u2019entr\u00e9e aux ind\u00e9sirables. L\u2019ASFC est per\u00e7ue comme \u00e9tant un service associ\u00e9 aux services policiers, et on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle se comporte ainsi. Les deux services participent au maintien de la paix et de l\u2019ordre au Canada. Il y a beaucoup de similitudes dans leurs fonctions.\n[25] L\u2019avocat de la Commission a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 un r\u00e9gime r\u00e9glementaire qui synchronise l\u2019examen des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC par rapport \u00e0 la LCDP avec la Direction des recours, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC.\n[26] Le paragraphe 43(4) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit :\nLe gouverneur en conseil peut fixer, par r\u00e8glement :\na) la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre par les enqu\u00eateurs;\nb) les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les plaintes dont ils sont saisis au titre de la pr\u00e9sente partie; [\u2026]\n[27] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1983, le Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil, sur la recommandation du ministre de la Justice, a pris le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise.\n[28] Les articles 3 et 9 du R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise sont pertinents quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate de l\u2019ASFC :\n3. Sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une plainte relative aux actes d\u2019un fonctionnaire charg\u00e9 de l\u2019application ou de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une loi portant sur les douanes et l\u2019accise, la Commission doit signifier au sous-ministre :\na) une copie de la plainte;\nb) un avis citant le nom de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi ;\nc) un projet d\u2019enqu\u00eate\n(i) qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les documents pertinents qui sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre sous la garde du minist\u00e8re et que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur peut demander \u00e0 examiner, et\n(ii) qui identifie les fonctionnaires que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur peut demander \u00e0 interroger.\n9. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur doit, \u00e0 la fin de son enqu\u00eate relative \u00e0 une plainte, aviser le receveur r\u00e9gional des douanes ou le directeur r\u00e9gional de l\u2019accise, de ses conclusions et des recommandations qu\u2019il compte pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Commission.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[29] La Commission soutient que le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise sous-entend n\u00e9cessairement que les agents de l\u2019ASFC fournissent un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et \u00e9tablissent un droit public de d\u00e9poser des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les agents de l\u2019ASFC traitent les voyageurs dans l\u2019administration ou dans l\u2019application des douanes f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et du droit d\u2019accise.\n[30] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument, la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une copie d\u2019un affidavit de Lucinda Reading, conseill\u00e8re principale de programme, Direction des recours, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC, dat\u00e9e du 4 mars 2009. Dans cet affidavit, Mme Reading d\u00e9crit ses t\u00e2ches :\n[traduction] Je suis responsable de traiter avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et de coordonner la gestion des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de discrimination li\u00e9es au service, y compris le contr\u00f4le des ententes ou d\u2019autres questions qui peuvent d\u00e9couler des plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les membres du public contre l\u2019ASFC.\n[31] Au paragraphe 4 de son affidavit, Mme Reading d\u00e9crit la relation officielle entre la Commission et l\u2019ASFC :\n[traduction] L\u2019ASFC et la Commission ont sign\u00e9 un protocole d\u2019entente g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Une copie de ce protocole d\u2019entente se trouve en annexe aux pr\u00e9sentes comme pi\u00e8ce \u00ab A \u00bb. L\u2019ASFC et la Commission ont sign\u00e9 un autre protocole d\u2019entente op\u00e9rationnel (en date du 31 mars 2006) qui d\u00e9finit les proc\u00e9dures, les r\u00f4les, les responsabilit\u00e9s et les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pr\u00e9vus pour guider l\u2019examen et le traitement des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 la Commission. Une copie du protocole d\u2019entente op\u00e9rationnel est annex\u00e9e aux pr\u00e9sentes comme pi\u00e8ce \u00ab B \u00bb. L\u2019ASFC s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que la Commission effectue ses enqu\u00eates pour les plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC conform\u00e9ment au protocole d\u2019entente et au protocole d\u2019entente op\u00e9rationnel.\n[32] L\u2019introduction du protocole d\u2019entente du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005 \u00e9tablit l\u2019objectif de la collaboration entre l\u2019ASFC et la Commission :\n[traduction] L\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019Agence) et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9es les \u00abparticipantes \u00bb, ont sign\u00e9 un protocole d\u2019entente le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005, dans lequel elles s\u2019entendent pour collaborer afin d\u2019\u00e9viter la discrimination en milieu de travail et dans la fourniture de services au public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ainsi que de prendre des mesures pour traiter efficacement toute plainte de discrimination qui peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e soit au sein de l\u2019Agence ou de la part du public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ce protocole d\u2019entente \u00e9tablit les proc\u00e9dures afin de guider les participantes dans l\u2019appui de ces objectifs. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[33] L\u2019avocat de la Commission a soutenu que, lors de l\u2019adoption de la LCDP, une loi qui interdit la discrimination dans la fourniture de \u00ab services \u00bb, et dans la cr\u00e9ation subs\u00e9quente de l\u2019ASFC, une agence dont le titre la d\u00e9crit \u00e0 titre de fournisseur de \u00ab services \u00bb, le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00fb avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019appliquer l\u2019interdiction de discrimination aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC.\n[34] Je conclus que le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise et les protocoles d\u2019entente \u00e9tablissent que c\u2019\u00e9tait bel et bien l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[35] La Commission a aussi soutenu que l\u2019ASFC s\u2019identifie comme \u00e9tant un fournisseur de services dans les publications suivantes :\n\u2022 L\u2019ASFC a publi\u00e9 un \u00ab engagement envers l\u2019excellence du service \u00bb, dont les composantes sont \u00ab le respect et la courtoisie \u00bb, \u00ab l\u2019application \u00e9quitable de la loi \u00bb, \u00ab le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb, \u00ab le service bilingue \u00bb, \u00ab l\u2019exactitude des renseignements \u00bb et \u00ab la r\u00e9vision des mesures prises et des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb.\n\u2022 Le site Web de l\u2019ASFC pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab l\u2019excellence du service est une priorit\u00e9 cl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada \u00bb.\n\u2022 Le code de conduite de l\u2019ASFC \u00e9tablit, entre autres choses, qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l vous est interdit de vous engager dans des pratiques discriminatoires bas\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e \u00bb. En marge, il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[36] Enfin, la Commission a soutenu que le fait d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC suivrait les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne provinciales qui portaient sur les services policiers qui, selon la Commission, s\u2019appliquent de fa\u00e7on semblable au comportement des agents de l\u2019ASFC :\n[traduction] Les deux participent aux activit\u00e9s de base quotidiennes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019administration et d\u2019application de la loi, activit\u00e9s qui visent au moins en partie \u00e0 soutenir des priorit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de s\u00fbret\u00e9 du public. Les deux ont des interactions directes face-\u00e0-face avec le public. Les deux ont le pouvoir d\u2019interroger et de fouiller des membres du public dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es.\n[37] Pendant la pr\u00e9sentation des observations orales pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9 des doutes lorsque l\u2019avocat de la Commission a soutenu que les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux provinciaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne selon lesquelles les forces polici\u00e8res fournissent un service g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement disponible au public \u00e9taient pertinentes. Cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es, je conclus qu\u2019il y a une acceptation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans la jurisprudence dans tout le Canada selon laquelle les policiers fournissent des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens des lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, et que la similitude entre les fonctions d\u2019application de la loi des policiers et celle des agents de l\u2019ASFC ne doit pas \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e parce que, comme l\u2019avocat de la Commission l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, [traduction] \u00ab le contraire ne tiendrait pas compte de la directive de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada selon laquelle les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on constante et harmonieuse, lorsque possible \u00bb.\nII. D\u00e9cision [38] L\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 2003 afin de fournir des services frontaliers int\u00e9gr\u00e9s, qui vont de la facilitation de l\u2019entr\u00e9e des personnes et des biens au maintien des priorit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. L\u2019une des principales activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC est l\u2019administration ou l\u2019application des lois en mati\u00e8re de douanes f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et de l\u2019accise, qui est en grande partie une fonction de perception des taxes. L\u2019application de la loi est ax\u00e9e sur les processus, de fa\u00e7on telle que lorsqu\u2019il y a un d\u00e9saccord avec une entreprise commerciale ou un voyageur, l\u2019ASFC entreprend un examen impartial de l\u2019action de l\u2019application de la loi et administre les lois applicables de fa\u00e7on objective et non discriminatoire.\n[39] L\u2019ASFC a une relation publique directe avec tous les Canadiens qui reviennent au Canada. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un organisme public qui fournit des services frontaliers pour le bien du public. Elle d\u00e9clare, de fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoque, son engagement envers \u00ab l\u2019excellence du service \u00bb pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des fronti\u00e8res du Canada, et cette \u00ab excellence du service \u00bb rev\u00eat une importance vitale envers la collectivit\u00e9 commerciale, les citoyens canadiens et les visiteurs du Canada.\n[40] Par implication et inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9cessaires, le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise \u00e9tablit que les agents de l\u2019ASFC fournissent un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP lorsqu\u2019ils administrent ou qu\u2019ils appliquent la loi sur l\u2019ASFC. Le R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise \u00e9tablit un droit public de d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne portant sur la fa\u00e7on dont les agents de l\u2019ASFC traitent les voyageurs lorsqu\u2019ils administrent ou qu\u2019ils appliquent la loi en mati\u00e8re des douanes et d\u2019accise f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[41] Conform\u00e9ment au R\u00e8glement sur les enqu\u00eates sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re des douanes et de l\u2019accise et aux protocoles d\u2019entente dat\u00e9s du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005 et du 31 mars 2006, la Commission et l\u2019ASFC ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 un processus fonctionnel et synchronis\u00e9 visant \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir la discrimination [traduction] \u00ab dans la fourniture de services au grand public, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 prendre des mesures afin de traiter de fa\u00e7on efficace toute plainte de discrimination qui pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sein de l\u2019Agence ou par le grand public \u00bb.\n[42] Lors des examens primaire et secondaire de Teiohontathe et de son v\u00e9hicule, les agents de l\u2019ASFC fournissaient des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LDCP. La plainte de Teiohontathe selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re et a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son sexe et de sa race doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e lors d\u2019une instruction par le Tribunal.\nIII. Ordonnances [43] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada visant le rejet de la plainte de Teiohontathe est rejet\u00e9e.\n[44] L\u2019instruction de la plainte de Teiohontathe par le Tribunal se poursuivra.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Garfield\nDate : Le 24 octobre 2011\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2011 TCDP 19\nIntroduction\n[1] Le 30 septembre 2011, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada (IPFPC) en obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019instance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, selon certaines conditions. L\u2019IPFPC peut contre\u2011interroger des t\u00e9moins et pr\u00e9senter des observations, mais peut seulement pr\u00e9senter des preuves apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal. Voici mes motifs pour cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nInstance principale\n[2] L\u2019instance porte sur la conclusion d\u2019une autre formation du Tribunal selon laquelle :\n[\u2026] les plaignants [qui sont maintenant 417] ont \u00e9tabli que le refus des intim\u00e9s, depuis mars 1978, de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux [presque exclusivement des femmes] proportionnellement \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle accord\u00e9e au travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux [principalement des m\u00e9decins de sexe masculin] constitue un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10. L\u2019acte a eu pour effet de priver les \u00e9valuateurs de la reconnaissance professionnelle et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 leurs qualifications et de les priver du paiement de leurs droits professionnels ainsi que des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et d\u2019avancement professionnel au m\u00eame titre que les conseillers.\n[Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social), 2007 TCDP 56, au paragraphe 143]\nLes \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux traitent des demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le cadre du programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[3] Tant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur la responsabilit\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9paration ont fait l\u2019objet de contr\u00f4les judiciaires, dont l\u2019un a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 dans le cas de la d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 et dont l\u2019autre a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli dans le cas de la d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9paration. La question de la r\u00e9paration a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e afin que deux questions soient r\u00e9solues : la premi\u00e8re portant sur l\u2019indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral et la deuxi\u00e8me portant sur l\u2019indemnisation pour la perte de revenu (y compris les avantages sociaux). Les parties ont n\u00e9goci\u00e9 une entente pour la question du pr\u00e9judice moral et ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal une ordonnance sur consentement r\u00e9glant cette question. La question de la perte de revenu reste pendante.\nRequ\u00eate en obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\n[4] L\u2019IPFPC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, avec tous les droits : c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le droit de pr\u00e9senter des preuves, de contre\u2011interroger les t\u00e9moins et de pr\u00e9senter des observations (orales et \u00e9crites). Les plaignants qui sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Armstrong et par Me Harrison ainsi que la Commission acceptent que l\u2019IPFPC obtienne le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Les plaignants qui se repr\u00e9sentent eux\u2011m\u00eames ne se sont pas prononc\u00e9s sur la question. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nMotifs de la requ\u00eate\n[5] L\u2019IPFPC soutient que l\u2019article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la LCDP), donne au Tribunal une grande discr\u00e9tion pour rendre une telle d\u00e9cision. Il soutient que le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e (parfois appel\u00e9 statut d\u2019intervenant) a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans les situations o\u00f9 :\na) l\u2019expertise de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e aiderait le Tribunal;\nb) sa participation ajouterait \u00e0 la position juridique des parties;\nc) l\u2019instance pourrait avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la partie requ\u00e9rante.\nL\u2019IPFPC soutient que le fait de satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019un de ces crit\u00e8res est suffisant pour obtenir le statut.\n[6] La partie requ\u00e9rante soutient qu\u2019elle a satisfait aux trois crit\u00e8res ou conditions. Quant au premier crit\u00e8re, l\u2019IPFPC a 91 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre d\u2019association, puis de syndicat, repr\u00e9sentant des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux. Aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019Institut compte environ 57 000 membres employ\u00e9s par environ 27 employeurs diff\u00e9rents dans sept comp\u00e9tences. Dix\u2011huit des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation, qui comportent plus de 40 000 membres, rel\u00e8vent de la sph\u00e8re du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Ces membres de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [traduction] \u00ab sont hautement qualifi\u00e9s et instruits et sont compos\u00e9s principalement de scientifiques et d\u2019autres professionnels \u00bb. Notamment, l\u2019IPFPC est l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux (des infirmiers et infirmi\u00e8res) (en date du 20 juillet 2011), des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux (des m\u00e9decins), et en effet, de tous les sous\u2011groupes du groupe professionnel Services de sant\u00e9 (SH). Ce groupe comprend donc les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[7] L\u2019IPFPC soutient que son expertise aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant de perte de revenu et la m\u00e9thode pour arriver \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision. [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 titre d\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur avanc\u00e9 et qui a de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019Institut compte un effectif professionnel qui a de l\u2019expertise dans les domaines de la classification, des n\u00e9gociations collectives et des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Les plaignants ne poss\u00e8dent pas cette expertise et cette connaissance. \u00bb L\u2019IPFPC souligne aussi qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de de l\u2019expertise en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et une [traduction] \u00ab exp\u00e9rience manifeste \u00bb de la pr\u00e9sentation de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne devant le Tribunal et les cours.\n[8] L\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur soutient aussi que sa participation ajoutera \u00e0 la position juridique des parties. Il cite un certain nombre d\u2019exemples. L\u2019IPFPC soutient que sa participation ne chevauchera pas celle des parties, bien qu\u2019il reconnaisse que beaucoup de ses positions seront semblables \u00e0 celles des plaignants et de la Commission.\n[9] Quant au troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, il soutient qu\u2019il a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur et que certains de ses membres participent \u00e9videmment \u00e0 l\u2019instance. Il est l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur actuel pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, qui comprennent la majorit\u00e9 des plaignants (certains d\u2019entre eux ont pris leur retraite) et pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux qui ne sont pas plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais qui pourraient n\u00e9anmoins avoir droit \u00e0 une indemnisation \u00e0 titre de \u00ab victimes \u00bb au sens de la LCDP.\n[10] L\u2019IPFPC note que la convention collective du groupe SH est venue \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance le mois dernier. La conclusion du Tribunal au sujet de la question de la perte de revenu sera pertinente quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation de la nouvelle convention collective, bien que les deux processus soient distincts. L\u2019IPFPC reconna\u00eet que le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer le montant appropri\u00e9 pour la perte de revenu pass\u00e9e en fonction de la LCDP, de la jurisprudence et de la preuve dont il est saisi. [traduction] \u00ab N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame un paiement forfaitaire pour la perte de revenu pass\u00e9e pourrait affecter les dispositions sur le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la prochaine convention collective des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et, par cons\u00e9quent, les clauses de la prochaine convention collective pourraient \u00eatre affect\u00e9es par une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. \u00bb\n[11] L\u2019IPFPC soutient aussi que la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la n\u00e9gociation n\u2019est pas coh\u00e9rente et n\u2019est pas claire [traduction] \u00ab en ce qui a trait au r\u00f4le de la n\u00e9gociation collective et du taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n\u00e9goci\u00e9 en fonction de la conclusion du Tribunal sur la perte de revenu \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, il [traduction] \u00ab reste pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que ses int\u00e9r\u00eats et ceux de ses membres pourraient \u00eatre affect\u00e9s par une ordonnance du Tribunal \u00bb.\n[12] L\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur soutient aussi que ses int\u00e9r\u00eats et ceux de ses membres sont en jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en particulier compte tenu du fait que la pratique discriminatoire se poursuit aujourd\u2019hui \u2013 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux re\u00e7oivent toujours un salaire en fonction du taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la classification des administrateurs de programmes. Cela malgr\u00e9 le fait que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 le 25 mai 2009 que le poste d\u2019\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical soit reclassifi\u00e9 dans un nouveau sous\u2011groupe en sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU\u2011EMU) et que \u00ab le travail visant \u00e0 la mise en place de ce nouveau sous\u2011groupe NU commence dans les 60 jours suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00bb : voir Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social), 2009 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 60. Selon l\u2019IPFPC, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab victoire \u00e0 la Pyrrhus \u00bb.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, pour obtenir le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, un demandeur doit satisfaire au crit\u00e8re \u00e0 deux volets suivant :\na) le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que son expertise aidera \u00e0 trancher les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi;\nb) le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ajoutera de fa\u00e7on importante \u00e0 la position juridique des parties qui ont un point de vue semblable.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019IPFPC ne satisfait \u00e0 aucun des deux volets.\n[14] Maintenant que la question du pr\u00e9judice moral semble \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e (en fonction de la question de savoir si tous les plaignants qui se repr\u00e9sentent eux\u2011m\u00eames ont souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019entente), la question qu\u2019il reste au Tribunal \u00e0 trancher est distincte : le montant de la perte de revenu (y compris les avantages sociaux). L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019expertise que l\u2019IPFPC dit poss\u00e9der (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire dans les domaines de la classification, de la n\u00e9gociation collective, des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et des droits de la personne) n\u2019aideront pas le Tribunal.\n[15] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son expertise en mati\u00e8re de classification, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu une d\u00e9cision et a ordonn\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un nouveau sous\u2011groupe en sciences infirmi\u00e8res. Cet aspect de l\u2019ordonnance n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. [traduction] \u00ab En fait, les plaignants ont soutenu devant le Tribunal que la mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e serait de les inclure dans la classification des sciences infirmi\u00e8res [dans un nouveau sous\u2011groupe : NU\u2011EMU]. \u00bb L\u2019IPFPC ne devrait pas pouvoir [traduction] \u00ab lancer une attaque collat\u00e9rale sur l\u2019ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente quant \u00e0 reclassification [\u2026] \u00bb Par cons\u00e9quent, son expertise dans ce domaine n\u2019aidera pas le Tribunal.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019expertise de l\u2019IPFPC en n\u00e9gociation collective n\u2019aidera pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal ne peut pas ordonner une indemnisation pour toute p\u00e9riode au\u2011del\u00e0 de la date \u00e0 laquelle la pratique discriminatoire a cess\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LCDP. De plus, il peut seulement ordonner un paiement forfaitaire \u00e0 titre de mesure de redressement mon\u00e9taire.\n[17] Quant aux taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la fonction publique, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que ceux\u2011ci sont \u00e0 la disposition du public et sont affich\u00e9s en ligne. [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019IPFPC n\u2019offre aucune expertise qui s\u2019ajoute \u00e0 ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la disposition du public ou qui peut \u00eatre obtenu par l\u2019entremise du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor. \u00bb\n[18] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019expertise en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le Tribunal lui\u2011m\u00eame ainsi que la Commission ont une expertise reconnue par la loi dans ce domaine.\n[19] L\u2019IPFPC n\u2019ajouterait pas non plus \u00e0 la position juridique des parties, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9. [traduction] \u00ab Les observations [de l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur] indiquent que sa position est virtuellement identique \u00e0 celle des plaignants et de la Commission. \u00bb\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que la nouvelle d\u00e9cision du Tribunal au sujet de la perte de revenu pass\u00e9e n\u2019affectera pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019IPFPC. Rien dans l\u2019instance \u00e0 ce jour n\u2019affecte la r\u00e9putation de l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur et, en effet, l\u2019IPFPC n\u2019est que r\u00e9cemment devenu l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur des plaignants qui sont \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux pour le RPC. De plus, il n\u2019existe aucune convention collective en vigueur entre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l\u2019IPFPC pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux sont toujours pay\u00e9s au taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration PM. De plus, [traduction] \u00ab la n\u00e9gociation collective est un processus distinct du r\u00e9examen du Tribunal au sujet de la perte de revenu pass\u00e9e. \u00bb De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, bien que l\u2019IPFPC repr\u00e9sente les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et d\u2019autres sous\u2011groupes en sciences infirmi\u00e8res, aucun de ces groupes n\u2019est partie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une ordonnance visant ces groupes.\n[21] En conclusion, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les plaignants repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Armstrong ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. [traduction] \u00ab Essentiellement, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019IPFPC vise \u00e0 demander, avec les plaignants, une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de revenu pass\u00e9e qui est fond\u00e9e sur un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que possible afin que l\u2019IPFPC puisse ensuite utiliser ce nouveau taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pass\u00e9e comme moyen de n\u00e9gociation dans la prochaine n\u00e9gociation collective. \u00bb\nAnalyse\nLes dispositions l\u00e9gales et la loi\n[22] L\u2019article 50 de la LCDP donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019ajouter des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019article ne pr\u00e9voit aucune condition pour l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. L\u2019article 8 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal traite des aspects proc\u00e9duraux d\u2019une telle requ\u00eate. Il existe de nombreux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents du Tribunal traitant de requ\u00eates en obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\n[23] En bref, la jurisprudence indique que le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans les situations o\u00f9 :\na) l\u2019expertise de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e aiderait le Tribunal;\nb) sa participation ajouterait \u00e0 la position juridique des parties;\nc) l\u2019instance pourrait avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la partie requ\u00e9rante.\n[24] J\u2019accueille la requ\u00eate, avec conditions, parce que je suis convaincu que l\u2019IPFPC a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il satisfait aux trois crit\u00e8res. Pour la question de l\u2019expertise pouvant aider le Tribunal, je suis convaincu que l\u2019IPFPC, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans l\u2019historique donn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, a de l\u2019expertise dans des domaines pour lesquels les plaignants et la Commission n\u2019ont pas d\u2019expertise, qui aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant de perte de revenu et la m\u00e9thode pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion. L\u2019exercice auquel le Tribunal doit participer n\u2019est pas simple. L\u2019IPFPC aidera \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. De plus, bien que les positions de l\u2019IPFPC soient, pour la majeure partie, identiques ou semblables \u00e0 celles des plaignants et de la Commission, il y a des moments o\u00f9 il prend une approche diff\u00e9rente, certaines approches \u00e9tant plus nuanc\u00e9es que d\u2019autres.\n[25] Quant au troisi\u00e8me motif, je suis convaincu que l\u2019instance aura des r\u00e9percussions sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats des membres de l\u2019IPFPC. L\u2019IPFPC est l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux plaignants et non plaignants qui peuvent \u00eatre reconnus \u00e0 titre de \u00ab victimes \u00bb au sens de la LCDP et qui ont droit \u00e0 une indemnisation. Pour cette seule raison, je conclus que l\u2019IPFPC a un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette phase de l\u2019instance.\n[26] Il est vrai que l\u2019IPFPC n\u2019est devenu l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur que tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Cependant, la pratique discriminatoire n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9, elle est continue. Bien que le poste d\u2019\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical a \u00e9t\u00e9 reclassifi\u00e9, les plaignants (et les \u00ab victimes \u00bb si elles sont incluses) sont, entre autres, toujours r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s au taux discriminatoire de PM. L\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2009 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u0153uvre compl\u00e8tement.\n[27] Je conviens aussi avec l\u2019IPFPC que la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet du chevauchement entre l\u2019instance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et la n\u00e9gociation collective n\u2019est pas coh\u00e9rente. Bien que je reconnaisse que les deux processus sont distincts et que le Tribunal doit trancher une question distincte (le montant de perte de revenu\/avantages sociaux, supposant que la question du pr\u00e9judice moral a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par tous les plaignants), il y a un chevauchement. La conclusion du Tribunal au sujet de la perte de revenu peut influencer les positions prises par le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et par l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur dans les n\u00e9gociations collectives \u00e0 venir. Bien entendu, il revient aux parties de la n\u00e9gociation collective de voir si cela se produira lors de la n\u00e9gociation ultime des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\nConclusion\n[28] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 le 30 septembre 2011 que l\u2019IPFPC obtienne le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il peut apporter des contributions n\u00e9cessaires et repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de ses membres en contre\u2011interrogeant des t\u00e9moins et en pr\u00e9sentant des observations \u2013 orales ou \u00e9crites. S\u2019il devient \u00e9vident qu\u2019il doit aussi pr\u00e9senter des preuves, l\u2019IPFPC pourra en demander l\u2019autorisation.\n[29] L\u2019obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de l\u2019IPFPC ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une invitation \u00e0 rouvrir les questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Par exemple, quant \u00e0 la question de la classification dans le sous\u2011groupe NU\u2011EMU, j\u2019h\u00e9site \u00e0 aller \u00e0 reculons et \u00e0 rouvrir cette question, comme l\u2019IPFPC semble le sugg\u00e9rer, en supposant que j\u2019aie le pouvoir de le faire, parce que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par une formation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du Tribunal et n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire par l\u2019une des parties. Cette question sera trait\u00e9e lors de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance \u00e0 venir.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMatthew D.

Introduction [1] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 19 au 22 juillet 2010, j\u2019ai men\u00e9 l\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les plaignants, James Louie et Joyce Beattie, selon lesquelles des agents d\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (le MAINC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9) avaient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans leur traitement des demandes de bail des plaignants pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en application du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens (la Loi).\n[2] L\u2019article 58(3) de la Loi se lit comme suit :\nLe ministre peut louer au profit de tout Indien, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, la terre dont ce dernier est en possession l\u00e9gitime sans que celle-ci soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e.\n[3] L\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\nd\u2019en priver un individu;\nde le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[4] L\u2019article 2 de la LCDP est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\nII. Les faits [5] \u00c0 la veille de l\u2019instruction, les parties se sont entendues afin de pr\u00e9senter un cahier conjoint de 178 documents. Pendant l\u2019instruction, 82 de ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us en preuve sur entente ou sur identification par les t\u00e9moins. Je suis convaincu que cette preuve documentaire repr\u00e9sente toutes les interactions et les communications pertinentes entre les plaignants et les agents du MAINC.\n[6] Deux personnes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 : Bruce Beattie, le mari de la plaignante Mme Beattie, qui a reconnu \u00eatre l\u2019auteur ou le r\u00e9viseur de pratiquement tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portant les signatures des plaignants, et Sheila Craig, directrice associ\u00e9e int\u00e9rimaire, Terres et d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, du MAINC. Ils ont tous les deux fournis une preuve convaincante expliquant la fa\u00e7on dont les demandes des plaignants pour un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es et pourquoi elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es par le ministre du MAINC.\n[7] Mme Craig a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il est de pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application du paragraphe 58(3), d\u2019envoyer au demandeur un formulaire d\u2019information \u2013 qu\u2019elle a qualifi\u00e9 de liste rigoureuse d\u2019exigences \u2013 avant que le MAINC commence \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer un bail appropri\u00e9. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces exigences sont fond\u00e9es sur des directives contenues dans le Guide de la gestion des terres du MAINC, un manuel qui refl\u00e8te les exp\u00e9riences pass\u00e9es et la jurisprudence, ce qui permet aux agents du MAINC d\u2019uniformiser le processus afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils n\u2019oublient rien dans la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un bail qui produira le revenu de location le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 possible pour les propri\u00e9taires fonciers autochtones.\n[8] M. Louie est un Indien au sens de la Loi. M. Louie est membre de la bande indienne Okanagan qui r\u00e9side dans la r\u00e9serve no 1 Okanagan sur des terres qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es par le conseil de bande avec l\u2019approbation du ministre du MAINC. Des certificats de possession \u00e9mis en vertu de l\u2019article 20 de la Loi prouvent le droit de possession l\u00e9gitime de M. Louie.\n[9] Le 27 juin 2007, M. Louie a sign\u00e9 un accord de coentreprise avec Mme Beattie, qui est aussi une Indienne au sens de la Loi. Ils se sont entendus pour former [traduction] \u00ab une association d\u2019entreprise afin de pr\u00e9parer et de pr\u00e9senter respectivement une Demande d\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne [\u2026] conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi pour un bail r\u00e9sidentiel pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme de (certaines) terres au d\u00e9veloppeur (Mme Beattie). \u00bb Le bail propos\u00e9 devait durer 49 ans et avoir un loyer nominal de 1 $. Selon l\u2019accord de coentreprise, Mme Beattie devait payer tous les frais de la construction d\u2019une maison sur la terre lou\u00e9e, puis d\u00e9frayer tous les co\u00fbts subs\u00e9quents de mise en march\u00e9 et d\u2019attribution du bail, dont les profits r\u00e9siduels devaient \u00eatre divis\u00e9s entre M. Louie et Mme Beattie selon une proportion de 2\/3 et 1\/3 respectivement. Il est important de pr\u00e9ciser que l\u2019entente stipulait que Mme Beattie ne pouvait pas mettre en march\u00e9 ou attribuer le bail \u00e0 une autre personne si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 un prix et selon des modalit\u00e9s acceptables pour M. Louie. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.8)\n[10] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juin 2007, M. Louie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la R\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique du MAINC pour un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location en application du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 :\na) une Demande d\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne, sign\u00e9e par Mme Beattie ;\nb) sa propre demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location d\u2019une terre;\nc) une r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande dat\u00e9e du 26 juin 2007 accordant la permission pour un arpentage et pour des plans d\u2019arpentage \u00e0 venir. L\u2019utilisation d\u00e9clar\u00e9e de la terre lou\u00e9e \u00e9tait la construction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale, qui ne devait pas mesurer plus de 500 m\u00b2. M. Louie a demand\u00e9 que sa demande soit termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 1er septembre 2007 et il a termin\u00e9 sa lettre en d\u00e9clarant que certaines choses n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9gociables.\n[traduction]\nComme vous le remarquerez dans les documents en annexe, le loyer total payable pour toute la dur\u00e9e du bail propos\u00e9 est un montant nominal pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 de 1 $. Veuillez noter que le loyer \u00e0 payer en vertu du bail propos\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une question qui est n\u00e9gociable ni pour la locataire, ni pour moi, et nous n\u2019avons ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre l\u2019intention de permettre \u00e0 vos agents d\u2019intervenir \u00e0 ce sujet. Pour cette raison, il serait d\u00e9raisonnable et tout \u00e0 fait inutile que vous exigiez une \u00e9valuation et je vous fournirai plut\u00f4t toute d\u00e9charge de responsabilit\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer dont vous puissiez avoir besoin. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.9)\n[11] Presque toutes les communications orales et \u00e9crites subs\u00e9quentes entre les plaignants et les agents du MAINC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s pour les plaignants par le mari de Mme Beattie, Bruce Beattie.\n[12] En date du 12 juillet 2007, les demandes des plaignants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 Daryl Adam, un agent de la gestion fonci\u00e8re du MAINC. Le 14 ao\u00fbt 2007, M. Adam a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Beattie lui expliquant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab en attente d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019avocat au sujet de la d\u00e9charge de responsabilit\u00e9 li\u00e9e au loyer nominal [\u2026] \u00bb (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.20)\n[13] Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2007, M. Beattie a envoy\u00e9 une \u00e9bauche de d\u00e9charge \u00e0 M. Adam. (Pi\u00e8ce A\u20111.23)\n[14] Le 19 septembre 2007, M. Louie a envoy\u00e9 par la poste \u00e0 M. Adam une d\u00e9charge valid\u00e9e dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait son intention de prendre soin de ses affaires \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et autonome :\n[traduction]\nJ\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante le montant du loyer qui sera \u00e0 payer selon le bail, en fonction de ce qui, \u00e0 mon avis, est un bon crit\u00e8re en affaires, et sans tenir compte d\u2019un loyer fictif selon le march\u00e9 qui serait d\u00e9riv\u00e9 d\u2019une estimation ou de toute autre \u00e9valuation arbitraire des terres que les agents du ministre peuvent pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer ou me recommander. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.26)\n[15] Le 21 septembre 2007, M. Adam a envoy\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse par courriel :\n[traduction]\nAfin de pouvoir accorder le bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location propos\u00e9, nous avons besoin de renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s en ce qui a trait aux objectifs et aux parties concern\u00e9es, puisqu\u2019on demande un loyer nominal. [\u2026]\nComme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beattie, certaines \u00e9tapes doivent \u00eatre suivies lors de l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location sur une r\u00e9serve, telles que : obtenir une r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande, faire effectuer une \u00e9valuation afin de d\u00e9terminer la valeur marchande de la terre et fournir tous les renseignements pertinents li\u00e9s \u00e0 la transaction. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.30)\n[16] Le 24 septembre 2007, la superviseure de M. Adam, Tamara Davidson, gestionnaire adjointe des Services fonciers et fiduciaires en Colombie-Britannique du MAINC, a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Louie dans lequel elle expliquait :\n[traduction]\nNotre directive pr\u00e9cise que toute d\u00e9viation \u00e0 la juste valeur locative doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par le locataire propos\u00e9, approuv\u00e9e par \u00e9crit par l\u2019occupant et recommand\u00e9e pour approbation par l\u2019agent des Terres. L\u2019occupant doit aussi demander un avis l\u00e9gal ou financier ind\u00e9pendant avant d\u2019accepter un montant plus bas que la juste valeur locative pour le loyer. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le loyer propos\u00e9 est beaucoup plus bas que celui du march\u00e9 et il ne semble y avoir aucun avantage d\u00e9coulant du bail pour l\u2019occupant. Daryl a demand\u00e9 plus de renseignements au sujet de cette entente avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre rendue au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer. [\u2026]\nNous fournissons un service aux Premi\u00e8res nations en Colombie-Britannique et nous souhaitons plus que tout suivre le processus de fa\u00e7on collaborative et respectueuse. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.32)\n[17] M. Louie a r\u00e9pondu le 24 septembre 2007, rejetant la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Davidson :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] il est \u00e9vident que vous ne voulez pas ou ne pouvez pas comprendre le point essentiel des questions que j\u2019ai soulev\u00e9es dans mon message. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, je vous demande de me fournir, avant la fin de la journ\u00e9e, des excuses et une confirmation que vous et vos agents, \u00e0 partir de maintenant, respecterez mon droit de d\u00e9terminer mes propres int\u00e9r\u00eats, sans votre soi-disante \u00ab protection \u00bb, qui est tout \u00e0 fait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et qui est un affront cruel \u00e0 ma dignit\u00e9 humaine. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1. 34)\n[18] Le 25 septembre 2007, M. Beattie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Ken McDonald, directeur par int\u00e9rim, Services fonciers et fiduciaires de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Le bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente demande n\u2019est qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mineur dans une coentreprise priv\u00e9e dans laquelle l\u2019occupant, le locataire et moi-m\u00eame sommes associ\u00e9s en affaires depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Les modalit\u00e9s de base du bail propos\u00e9 (en particulier le loyer) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9es dans le contexte d\u2019un plan d\u2019affaires g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gociables ou modifiables une fois que la demande de bail a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au MAINC.\n[\u2026] Malheureusement, (nous) avons appris vendredi dernier que des gestionnaires dans votre bureau n\u2019ont plus l\u2019intention d\u2019honorer une condition principale sur laquelle nous nous fondions et, par cons\u00e9quent, le bail ne peut pas \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9. La question en litige est que la condition principale du bail propos\u00e9 \u00e9tait le loyer nominal non n\u00e9gociable pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9charge de responsabilit\u00e9 acceptable de la part de l\u2019occupant en faveur de la Couronne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.35)\n[19] Le 1er octobre 2007, M. Beattie a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 la sous ministre adjointe Caroline Davis, lui disant qu\u2019il n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre du 25 septembre 2007 qu\u2019il avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. McDonald :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] \u00c0 mon avis la principale question en litige n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement compliqu\u00e9e. L\u2019administration du MAINC respecte, ou ne respecte pas, le droit fondamental d\u2019un Indien d\u2019\u00eatre reconnu comme un \u00eatre humain comp\u00e9tent qui est en mesure de d\u00e9terminer son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel quant \u00e0 une terre sur la r\u00e9serve. Une r\u00e9ponse favorable, qui est probablement la seule r\u00e9ponse raisonnable pour cette question, devrait \u00eatre suffisante pour r\u00e9soudre tous les probl\u00e8mes dans ce dossier. (Pi\u00e8ce A\u20111.37)\n[20] M. McDonald a r\u00e9pondu le 11 octobre 2007. Apr\u00e8s avoir reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait conscient que le loyer nominal \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 une coentreprise entre M. Louie et les Beattie, M. McDonald a rejet\u00e9 la d\u00e9charge fourni par M. Louie et a expliqu\u00e9 que certaines \u00e9tapes devaient \u00eatre respect\u00e9es par les plaignants :\n[traduction]\n-Nous avons besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires expliquant pourquoi il y a un loyer nominal pour le projet propos\u00e9.\n-Une \u00e9valuation des terres doit aussi \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e, comme le pr\u00e9voit la directive 7-3, clause 2.6.2 du Guide de la gestion des terres :\n[traduction] \u00ab parmi les modalit\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre n\u00e9goci\u00e9es tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t : le loyer propos\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une \u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendante fournie par le locataire propos\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9e par Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada. \u00bb\n-Nous avons aussi besoin d\u2019un certificat d\u2019avis juridique de la part de l\u2019occupant afin de garantir qu\u2019il accepte les modalit\u00e9s du bail et qu\u2019il comprend ses droits.\n[21] M. McDonald a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le MAINC continuerait de travailler avec les plaignants de fa\u00e7on respectueuse s\u2019il \u00e9tait satisfait \u00e0 toutes ces exigences. Il a ensuite fait un commentaire gratuit :\n[traduction]\nMalheureusement, la Loi sur les Indiens ne dit pas que le ministre doit louer des terres selon les modalit\u00e9s et les directives de l\u2019occupant.

(Pi\u00e8ce A-1. 100)\n[33] Le 19 mars 2008, M. Louie a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de trois pages au ministre du MAINC, Chuck Strahl :\n[traduction]\nJe vous \u00e9cris parce que vous \u00eates le ministre des Affaires indiennes, mais aussi parce que vous avez la r\u00e9putation d\u2019\u00eatre une personne de grande int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et d\u2019ouverture d\u2019esprit envers le peuple autochtone. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous ferez jouer ces qualit\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019un cas s\u00e9rieux de traitement d\u00e9shonorable et abusif dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime dans mes interactions avec certains agents des Terres du MAINC qui agissent en votre nom.\nJe suis un membre de la bande indienne Okanagan et j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par l\u2019administration de la bande pendant plus de 25 ans. Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, je me suis aussi lanc\u00e9 dans certaines entreprises priv\u00e9es, j\u2019ai d\u2019ailleurs occup\u00e9 un poste de fonctionnaire \u00e9lectoral et j\u2019ai g\u00e9r\u00e9 des baux fonciers sur mesure. Compte tenu de cette exp\u00e9rience, je me consid\u00e8re enti\u00e8rement en mesure de g\u00e9rer de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante mes propres affaires priv\u00e9es et financi\u00e8res, et je prends l\u2019enti\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle de mes propres d\u00e9cisions en ce qui a trait \u00e0 mon int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9 quant aux terres sur la r\u00e9serve. Au cours des 10 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, j\u2019ai acquis plusieurs parcelles de terre non d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9serve indienne Okanagan no 1 pr\u00e8s de Vernon (Colombie-Britannique), en vertu de certificats de possession (CP) d\u00e9cern\u00e9s en application de la Loi sur les Indiens. Mon objectif \u00e0 long terme est que ces parcelles de terre soient d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es pour mon int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique et celui de la collectivit\u00e9 de la bande Okanagan.\nAfin que je puisse utiliser mes terres d\u00e9cern\u00e9es en vertu de CP, la Loi sur les Indiens m\u2019oblige \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande de bail minist\u00e9riel au sens du paragraphe 58(3). Un tel bail vise clairement \u00e0 offrir des avenues de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et des avantages pour les d\u00e9tenteurs de CP, mais selon mon exp\u00e9rience, le processus de demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location, tel qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9sentement g\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, est devenu tellement inefficace et offensif du point de vue de la race qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019il bloque, plut\u00f4t que facilite, le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique. Il m\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident que la majorit\u00e9 des aspects n\u00e9gatifs du processus de demande de bail existant d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une attitude archa\u00efque et raciste ancr\u00e9e selon laquelle tous les Indiens sont incomp\u00e9tents et ne peuvent d\u00e9terminer leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont assur\u00e9ment besoin du paternalisme d\u00e9gradant que les agents du MAINC appellent de fa\u00e7on euph\u00e9mique une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb. Bien que je reconnaisse que cette perception existe chez les agents du MAINC et qu\u2019elle est incorpor\u00e9e dans les politiques et les pratiques administratives du MAINC, je n\u2019accepte pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une justification factuelle ou l\u00e9gale. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accepte pas qu\u2019elle ait un effet contraignant pour moi ou pour la fa\u00e7on dont je choisis d\u2019utiliser mes propres terres.\nAu cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux demandes distinctes en application du paragraphe 58(3) pour des baux r\u00e9sidentiels tr\u00e8s simples. Le format de ces demandes a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb ne se d\u00e9veloppe entre moi et le MAINC. Les deux demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sous condition que le MAINC ne prenne aucune responsabilit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des modalit\u00e9s du bail principal, en particulier le loyer. Pour atteindre ce r\u00e9sultat, chaque demande n\u00e9cessitait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que le MAINC reconnaisse et respecte mon droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante un loyer non n\u00e9gociable qui ne visait pas \u00e0 refl\u00e9ter la valeur du march\u00e9. En plus des exigences habituelles pour ces demandes, chaque demande comprenait une d\u00e9charge de responsabilit\u00e9 officielle et une d\u00e9claration d\u2019avantages afin de prot\u00e9ger la Couronne de toute responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale ou fiduciaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer. Afin de confirmer mon engagement \u00e0 m\u2019assurer que ces transactions fonci\u00e8res ne pr\u00e9senteraient aucun risque pour la Couronne, je me suis engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir toute d\u00e9charge suppl\u00e9mentaire que les agents du MAINC pourraient me demander \u00e0 tout moment dans le processus de demande. Les agents du MAINC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du fondement sur lequel chacune de mes demandes en application du paragraphe 58(3) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour qu\u2019elles soient re\u00e7ues et trait\u00e9es.\nEn octobre 2007, lorsque l\u2019arpentage de subdivision pour les lots r\u00e9sidentiels a \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 et que le processus pour la premi\u00e8re demande a atteint l\u2019\u00e9tape o\u00f9 une \u00e9bauche de bail devait m\u2019\u00eatre remise, j\u2019ai plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 qu\u2019un gestionnaire anonyme de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait essentiellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le fait de permettre \u00e0 un demandeur de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location d\u2019\u00e9tablir son propre loyer, sans la supervision et le contr\u00f4le paternalistes du MAINC, ne co\u00efncidait pas avec la politique \u00e9tablie et les pratiques conventionnelles et que ce ne serait donc pas permis. Cela repr\u00e9sentait un renversement \u00e9vident de la position du MAINC par rapport \u00e0 sa position lorsque la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e pour traitement et pendant les quatre mois ou moi-m\u00eame et les agents du MAINC nous sommes fond\u00e9s sur cette acceptation du MAINC.\nCe renversement de mauvaise foi de la position du MAINC aussi tard dans le processus \u00e9tait, semble-t-il, une tentative de transformer un processus administratif, qui devait depuis le d\u00e9but \u00eatre sans risque pour la Couronne, en un processus o\u00f9 la gestion du MAINC insiste pour que la Couronne soit soumise \u00e0 tous les risques et \u00e0 toutes les responsabilit\u00e9s possibles qui lui seraient impos\u00e9es si je n\u2019avais pris aucune responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et si je n\u2019avais fourni aucune d\u00e9charge ou d\u00e9claration visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la Couronne. Tout cela, sans autre raison que de justifier l\u2019imposition d\u2019exigences proc\u00e9durales additionnelles et offensantes qui n\u2019ont clairement aucun autre objet que d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les risques possibles de la \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb qui est cr\u00e9\u00e9e lorsque le MAINC se r\u00e9serve le pouvoir exclusif d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer au nom de l\u2019occupant.\nLa position clairement absurde qu\u2019ont pris ces gestionnaires nous a men\u00e9 \u00e0 une impasse dans le processus de demande, qui n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue que lorsque le directeur des Services fonciers et fiduciaire de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique est intervenu personnellement. En acceptant simplement de respecter, \u00e0 titre de droit de la personne fondamental, ma libert\u00e9 personnelle de choisir de ne pas participer \u00e0 une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb abusive et inutile du point de vue l\u00e9gal avec la Couronne, le directeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de proposer une avenue qui convient aux deux parties et qui, une fois suivie, m\u2019assurerait que le bail, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine, serait termin\u00e9. Me fiant \u00e0 l\u2019assurance absolument claire du directeur selon laquelle il avait le pouvoir de s\u2019engager, au nom du MAINC, \u00e0 terminer le bail conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 notre entente, j\u2019ai satisfait de fa\u00e7on diligente \u00e0 ma partie de l\u2019entente \u00e0 la mi-novembre. Depuis cette date, les agents des terres m\u2019ont assur\u00e9 de nombreuses fois que l\u2019\u00e9bauche du bail promise \u00e9tait soit presque termin\u00e9e, soit termin\u00e9e, et que je pouvais m\u2019attendre \u00e0 recevoir une copie dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais.\nQuatre mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis et je n\u2019ai toujours rien vu de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de bail promise. Il est aussi de plus en plus \u00e9vident que des gestionnaires bloquent une fois de plus le processus de demande afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher le directeur d\u2019honorer l\u2019engagement qu\u2019il a pris en octobre de compl\u00e9ter le bail. La deuxi\u00e8me demande de bail r\u00e9sidentiel a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le directeur et a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 des agents des terres pour qu\u2019elle soit trait\u00e9e il y a presque deux mois, mais elle en est arriv\u00e9e au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que la premi\u00e8re. Les deux demandes sont maintenant retenues en raison d\u2019une obstruction injustifi\u00e9e de la part de gestionnaires qui ne d\u00e9montrent aucun engagement en ce qui concerne la raison, la justice ou l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9.\nJe crois que cette suite d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9montre clairement un niveau de dysfonction administrative au bureau des terres de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique qui ne peut que se refl\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative sur tout engagement que vous et votre minist\u00e8re avez en ce qui concerne l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et le traitement honorable des particuliers indiens propri\u00e9taires fonciers. La situation n\u2019est certainement pas propice au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique des terres sur les r\u00e9serves, en particulier puisque la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de terres d\u00e9cern\u00e9es en vertu de CP est bien \u00e9tablie et est la seule occasion de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique viable et durable.\nJ\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous demanderez \u00e0 l\u2019un de vos employ\u00e9s d\u2019enqu\u00eater au sujet des questions s\u00e9rieuses que j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9crire de la fa\u00e7on la plus juste possible. Je m\u2019attends \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate appropri\u00e9e d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il ne fait aucun doute que des engagements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en votre nom et que ces engagements devaient \u00eatre honor\u00e9s. On ne saurait nier que ces engagements n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 honor\u00e9s et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune justification raisonnable pour le retard qui se poursuit. La seule question importante qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 r\u00e9gler est celle de savoir si votre minist\u00e8re a suffisamment d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 administrative pour honorer les promesses et les engagements pris sous votre autorit\u00e9 et en votre nom.\nCe que j\u2019ai d\u00e9crit dans la pr\u00e9sente est bien document\u00e9 et il me fera plaisir de fournir des copies de mes dossiers ou toute autre information dont un enqu\u00eateur pourrait avoir besoin. Je vous remercie de vous pencher sur la question.\nJames Louie (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.109)\n[34] Le 15 mai 2008, le ministre Chuck Strahl a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Louie :\n[traduction]\nLa pr\u00e9sente porte sur votre lettre du 19 mars 2007 et sur votre demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location sur la r\u00e9serve indienne Okanagan no 1.\nEn droit, il existe une relation sp\u00e9ciale entre un d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un certificat de possession et le Canada. Le droit sous-jacent aux terres d\u2019une r\u00e9serve appartient \u00e0 la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, alors que les avantages de ces terres et le droit de les poss\u00e9der appartiennent au d\u00e9tenteur du certificat de possession. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas habituellement pour un propri\u00e9taire foncier priv\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit de circonstances sp\u00e9ciales, entra\u00eenant une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb. Un rapport fiduciaire est cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre le d\u00e9tenteur du certificat de possession et le Canada lorsque le Canada contracte des baux de certificats de possession. Cela est fond\u00e9 sur le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire unilat\u00e9ral du Canada sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9tenteur indien du certificat de possession. Seule une r\u00e9forme l\u00e9gislative peut annuler ou modifier cette relation.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, comme le Canada est la premi\u00e8re partie dans tout instrument accordant un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les terres des r\u00e9serves, un examen attentif des d\u00e9tails du bail doit \u00eatre entrepris afin que les modalit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es soient \u00e9tablies dans le bail.\nEn vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer revient au Canada et ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, sauf par modification de la loi. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et une d\u00e9charge ne modifiera pas le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s du bail, qui comprennent aussi, sans s\u2019y limiter, des dispositions quant \u00e0 l\u2019environnement.\nLe processus de bail pour les terres des r\u00e9serves est le m\u00eame partout au Canada et il d\u00e9coule de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures qui sont actuellement en place. Certaines exigences doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es avant que le droit de tenure \u00e0 bail soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre partie sur les terres des r\u00e9serves.\nLes Premi\u00e8res nations peuvent choisir de se retirer de la Loi sur les Indiens pour la gestion des terres gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la Loi sur la gestion des terres des Premi\u00e8res nations, \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et \u00e0 des trait\u00e9s. Le minist\u00e8re encourage les membres des Premi\u00e8res nations et les conseils de bande \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e9gimes \u00e0 long terme qui satisfont aux besoins de leur collectivit\u00e9.\nLe 31 mars 2008, une \u00e9bauche de bail vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e pour examen. Je vous demande de travailler avec le bureau r\u00e9gional de la Colombie-Britannique afin que les agents puissent vous aider \u00e0 satisfaire aux exigences pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location sur une terre de r\u00e9serve. J\u2019encouragerai mes agents \u00e0 vous consulter pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un loyer qui sera rentable.\nChuck Strahl (pi\u00e8ce A-1.125)\n[35] Le processus de demande s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de 2008, et il y a eu d\u2019autres \u00e9changes non productifs entre les plaignants et le MAINC. Il convient de noter un \u00e9change interne au MAINC entre M. McDonald et Mme Craig au sujet de M. Beattie. Mme Craig a avis\u00e9 M. McDonald par courriel le 7 novembre 2008 d\u2019une longue conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu\u2019elle avait eue avec M. Beattie, au cours de laquelle elle avait rejet\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019octroi imm\u00e9diat de bail selon les conditions qu\u2019il avait pos\u00e9es. Le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe du courriel est important :\n[traduction]\nIl (M. Beattie) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les baux qu\u2019il nous avait envoy\u00e9s \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que les n\u00f4tres, sauf qu\u2019il avait effac\u00e9 un certain nombre de choses qui, \u00e0 son avis, ne nous concernaient pas. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Louie voulait utiliser un bail pour lui-m\u00eame et l\u2019autre pour payer sa maison. Il a soutenu que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne valait que 10 000 $. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019elle vaudrait \u00e0 son avis s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en fief simple ; il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle vaudrait plus de 300 000 $. Je lui ai alors expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle nous devions nous assurer que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de M. Louie \u00e9tait sauvegard\u00e9 avant qu\u2019il loue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour plus de 49 ans et qu\u2019il la perde ensuite pour inex\u00e9cution. M. Beattie semblait penser que le CP serait rendu \u00e0 M. Louie s\u2019il y avait inex\u00e9cution; je ne sais pas qui accorderait une hypoth\u00e8que selon ces modalit\u00e9s.\n[36] Mme Craig a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 M. McDonald de [traduction] \u00ab tout lui retourner et de lui sugg\u00e9rer une date de rencontre, puis de fermer le dossier s\u2019il y a toujours impasse [\u2026] \u00bb (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.164)\n[37] Le 11 novembre 2008, M. McDonald a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Craig :\n[traduction]\n\u00c7a me semble bon Sheila. En passant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je communiquais avec lui, je lui ai dit de rester discret et que je ferais ce que je pourrais. Vous vous souviendrez des deux d\u00e9charges, etc. Lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire toutes ces lettres, nous lui avons dit que nous n\u2019avions aucune autre option que de suivre les r\u00e8gles. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1. 167) [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[38] Les parties se sont retrouv\u00e9es dans une impasse. M. Louie insistait sur son droit \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien entrepreneur et de citoyen canadien, propri\u00e9taire des terres vis\u00e9es par les certificats de possession, de mettre \u00e0 profit une partie de ces terres dans le cadre d\u2019un accord de coentreprise avec Mme Beattie, et les agents du MAINC soutenaient r\u00e9solument et r\u00e9p\u00e9titivement qu\u2019ils avaient un droit absolu d\u2019\u00e9tablir tous les aspects du bail propos\u00e9, y compris le loyer p\u00e9riodique fond\u00e9 sur une \u00e9valuation de la terre vis\u00e9e.\n[39] Je suis convaincu que les agents du MAINC ont mal compris l\u2019accord de coentreprise des plaignants ou qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont jamais examin\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un accord de trois pages simplement \u00e9crit dans lequel il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Louie et Mme Beattie ont form\u00e9 une association d\u2019entreprise dans le but de pr\u00e9senter une demande en application du paragraphe 58(3) [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] pour un bail d\u2019habitation \u00e0 long terme et pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 [\u2026] dans l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9ventuellement mettre le bail en march\u00e9 et de l\u2019attribuer \u00e0 une tierce partie. \u00bb Plusieurs clauses de l\u2019accord de coentreprise sont pertinentes et auraient d\u00fb guider les agents du MAINC dans le traitement des demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants :\n[traduction]\n2. La dur\u00e9e propos\u00e9e du bail de la Couronne sera de quarante-neuf (49) ans, ou toute autre p\u00e9riode plus longue sur laquelle les parties s\u2019entendent mutuellement [\u2026]\n3. Les terres seront lou\u00e9es pour une r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale, y compris toute am\u00e9lioration et utilisation qui est n\u00e9cessairement ou raisonnablement li\u00e9e \u00e0 cet objectif.\n4. Le promoteur (Mme Beattie) fera un paiement unique d\u2019un dollar (1 $) \u00e0 titre de paiement complet et final de tout loyer d\u00fb et payable en vertu des modalit\u00e9s du bail de la Couronne.\n5. Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe 6 ci-dessous, le d\u00e9veloppeur paiera tous les frais encourus pour la pr\u00e9paration de la demande d\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne, y compris des plans, les arpentages, les \u00e9valuations, les \u00e9tudes d\u2019impact sur l\u2019environnement et l\u2019enregistrement du bail de la Couronne n\u00e9cessaires ainsi que tous les frais quant \u00e0 l\u2019affichage sur le march\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019attribution du bail de la Couronne.\n6. Le d\u00e9veloppeur pourra \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 pour tous les frais mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 5 ci\u2011dessus et aura la priorit\u00e9 pour l\u2019obtention des produits de toute attribution du bail de la Couronne, les produits r\u00e9siduels devant \u00eatre divis\u00e9s entre les parties selon un taux de deux tiers (2\/3) \u00e0 l\u2019occupant et un tiers (1\/3) au d\u00e9veloppeur.\n7. Le d\u00e9veloppeur ne mettra pas en march\u00e9 et n\u2019attribuera pas le bail de la Couronne \u00e0 une tierce partie, sauf \u00e0 un prix et selon des modalit\u00e9s qui sont acceptables pour l\u2019occupant.\n[40] Un agent du MAINC a reconnu pour la premi\u00e8re fois l\u2019accord de coentreprise dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 octobre 2007 que M. McDonald a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Beattie en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de ce dernier du 25 septembre 2007 : [traduction] \u00ab vous avez pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans votre lettre qu\u2019il y a une proposition pour un loyer nominal pour ce bail particulier d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location. De plus, vous avez pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le loyer nominal \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 un accord de coentreprise entre vous\u2011m\u00eame, l\u2019occupant et le locataire. \u00bb M. McDonald a ensuite \u00e9nonc\u00e9 plusieurs exigences \u00e0 satisfaire avant que le MAINC accepte le loyer nominal, notamment la pr\u00e9sentation [traduction] \u00ab de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la raison pour laquelle il y aurait un loyer nominal pour ce projet propos\u00e9 \u00bb. J\u2019en d\u00e9duis que M. McDonald n\u2019avait pas lu l\u2019accord de coentreprise. S\u2019il l\u2019avait lu, il aurait imm\u00e9diatement remarqu\u00e9 que le loyer nominal de 1 $ ne visait pas \u00e0 produire un avantage direct pour M. Louie. Plut\u00f4t, le loyer de 1 $ pour 49 ans visait \u00e0 accomplir deux choses : premi\u00e8rement, il s\u2019agissait de la contribution de M. Louie \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise et, deuxi\u00e8mement, lorsque Mme Beattie aurait construit une maison unifamiliale sur la terre et l\u2019aurait mise en march\u00e9, la vente aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue par l\u2019attribution du droit du locataire de Mme Beattie \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur et M. Louie aurait re\u00e7u l\u2019avantage du 2\/3 du produit net de la vente.\n[41] Les pr\u00e9occupations que Mme Craig a exprim\u00e9es dans son courriel du 7 novembre 2008 au sujet de la perte possible de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de M. Louie quant au CP s\u2019il y a inex\u00e9cution n\u2019ont aucun sens dans le contexte de la coentreprise.\nIII. L\u2019objet de la LCDP [42] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a toujours soutenu que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ont un caract\u00e8re fondamental et quasi constitutionnel et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elles doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re large et lib\u00e9rale qui invoque les consid\u00e9rations de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sous-jacentes :\nCommission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd. (O\u2019Malley), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536., aux pages 546 et 547\n(Au sujet du pr\u00e9ambule du Code ontarien des droits de la personne)\nNous y trouvons un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Code et c\u2019est cette politique qui doit s\u2019appliquer. Ce n\u2019est pas, \u00e0 mon avis, une bonne solution que d\u2019affirmer que, selon les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation bien \u00e9tablies, on ne peut pr\u00eater au Code un sens plus large que le sens le plus \u00e9troit que peuvent avoir les termes qui y sont employ\u00e9s. Les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation accept\u00e9es sont suffisamment souples pour permettre \u00e0 la Cour de reconna\u00eetre, en interpr\u00e9tant un code des droits de la personne, la nature et l\u2019objet sp\u00e9ciaux de ce texte l\u00e9gislatif (voir le juge Lamer dans Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145, aux pp. 157 et 158), et de lui donner une interpr\u00e9tation qui permettra de promouvoir ses fins g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Une loi de ce genre est d\u2019une nature sp\u00e9ciale. Elle n\u2019est pas vraiment de nature constitutionnelle, mais elle est certainement d\u2019une nature qui sort de l\u2019ordinaire. Il appartient aux tribunaux d\u2019en rechercher l\u2019objet et de le mettre en application. Le Code vise la suppression de la discrimination. C\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence. Toutefois, sa fa\u00e7on principale de proc\u00e9der consiste non pas \u00e0 punir l\u2019auteur de la discrimination, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 offrir une voie de recours aux victimes de la discrimination. C\u2019est le r\u00e9sultat ou l\u2019effet de la mesure dont on se plaint qui importe. Si elle cr\u00e9e effectivement de la discrimination, si elle a pour effet d\u2019imposer \u00e0 une personne ou \u00e0 un groupe de personnes des obligations, des peines ou des conditions restrictives non impos\u00e9es aux autres membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, elle est discriminatoire.\n[43] C.N.R. c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, au paragraphe 24 (Action Travail)\n24 La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l\u2019essor des droits individuels d\u2019importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu\u2019en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu\u2019elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu\u2019offre la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\nIV. Le MAINC fournit-il des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP? [44] Des extraits de deux d\u00e9cisions sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si toutes les actions gouvernementales sont des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[45] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, [2008] A.C.F. no 710 (C.A.), \u00e0 la page 9, la Cour a fait l\u2019observation suivante :\nSur ce point, je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que, comme les mesures du gouvernement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prises au profit du public, l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9es au public \u00bb est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires mettant en cause une discrimination attribuable \u00e0 des mesures prises par le gouvernement (voir, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions Rosin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 11, et Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission c. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) , (1988), 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253, aux p. 266-268). Toutefois, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir lorsqu\u2019on applique l\u2019article 5 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s constituent des \u00ab services \u00bb (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 60).\n[46] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin, 1 C.F. 391 (paragraphes 8 et 11), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019un service n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre offert \u00e0 tous les membres du grand public pour qu\u2019il soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb :\nPour qu\u2019un service ou une installation soit destin\u00e9 au public, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que tous les citoyens y aient acc\u00e8s. Il suffit qu\u2019un segment de la population soit en mesure de se pr\u00e9valoir du service ou de l\u2019installation. Le fait de prescrire que certaines exigences ou que certaines conditions soient remplies n\u2019\u00e9limine pas le caract\u00e8re public d\u2019une activit\u00e9. La jurisprudence a montr\u00e9 que le terme \u00ab public \u00bb signifie \u00ab qui n\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 \u00bb, ce qui laisse, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019activit\u00e9s hors de la port\u00e9e de la l\u00e9gislation.\nIl est difficile d\u2019imaginer un gouvernement ou un secteur du gouvernement qui pr\u00e9tendrait qu\u2019un service qu\u2019il offrait \u00e9tait un service priv\u00e9, non destin\u00e9 au public. En fait, il serait permis de dire que pratiquement tout ce que fait le gouvernement, il le fait pour le public, est destin\u00e9 au public, et le public peut s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir.\n[47] Le MAINC est un minist\u00e8re gouvernemental qui offre de nombreux services aux Indiens inscrits en vertu de la Loi. Dans son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de baux d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location en application du paragraphe 58(3), Mme Craig a appel\u00e9 les plaignants des \u00ab clients \u00bb et a expliqu\u00e9 les nombreuses fa\u00e7ons dont le MAINC interc\u00e8de pour les occupants lorsqu\u2019il prend des ententes de location avec des locataires possibles.\n[48] Le fait que le paragraphe 58(3) comprenne des dispositions quant \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 une certaine partie du public est reconnu par les Services fonciers et fiduciaires du MAINC, comme le prouve le courriel de Mme Davidson envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Louie le 24 septembre 2007 :\n[traduction]\nJe peux vous garantir que les Services fonciers et fiduciaires sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 travailler avec vous dans le processus de bail. Nous fournissons un service aux Premi\u00e8res nations en Colombie\u2011Britannique et nous souhaitons plus que tout suivre le processus de fa\u00e7on collaborative et respectueuse.\n[49] Je conclus que le MAINC fournit des services qui sont \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les membres du public qui sont des Indiens inscrits, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de services importants qui sont \u00ab destin\u00e9s \u00bb et \u00ab offerts \u00bb au public.\nV. Interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi [50] Je suis convaincu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a faite du paragraphe 58(3) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boyer c. R. [1986] 2 C.F. 393, s\u2019applique aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n15 [\u2026] Ce droit que poss\u00e8de un membre de la bande sur la parcelle de terrain qui lui est attribu\u00e9e et qui se trouve en sa possession l\u00e9gitime, m\u00eame s\u2019il est, en principe, irr\u00e9vocable, demeure soumis a un grand nombre de restrictions formelles. Le membre n\u2019a pas le droit de c\u00e9der son droit \u00e0 la possession ou de louer son terrain \u00e0 une personne qui n\u2019est pas membre (article 28) ; il ne peut non plus l\u2019hypoth\u00e9quer, puisque les terres en question ne sont assujetties \u00e0 aucune saisie sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019un acte judiciaire (article 29); il peut \u00e9galement se voir forc\u00e9 d\u2019en disposer s\u2019il cesse d\u2019avoir droit de r\u00e9sider sur la r\u00e9serve (article 25). Il ne fait aucun doute que chacune de ces restrictions a pour effet de rendre le droit d\u2019un Indien en possession l\u00e9gitime tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire poss\u00e9dant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue selon la common law. Il doit cependant \u00eatre not\u00e9 que toutes ces restrictions n\u2019ont qu\u2019un seul but : emp\u00eacher que la fin poursuivie par la mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 du terrain, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019utilisation de celui-ci par la bande et ses membres, soit contrecarr\u00e9e. Aucune de ces restrictions concerne l\u2019usage pouvant \u00eatre fait du terrain ou le profit pouvant en \u00eatre tir\u00e9. Le terrain faisant partie de la r\u00e9serve, son usage est, naturellement, toujours assujetti aux lois provinciales d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et aux r\u00e8glements de zonage \u00e9dict\u00e9s par le conseil de bande, comme c\u2019est le cas pour tout terrain situ\u00e9 dans une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de laquelle des r\u00e8glements de zonage sont en vigueur; cependant, outre cela, je ne vois ni comment ni pourquoi l\u2019Indien en possession l\u00e9gitime d\u2019un terrain situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une r\u00e9serve pourrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de l\u2019exploiter \u00e0 sa guise. Rien dans la Loi ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme [traduction] \u00ab assujettissant \u00bb son droit \u00e0 un autre droit du m\u00eame type appartenant simultan\u00e9ment au conseil de bande. Selon moi, par l\u2019\"attribution\" d\u2019une parcelle de terrain faisant partie d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, le droit \u00e0 l\u2019usage de ce terrain et au profit qu\u2019il peut procurer, de collectif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, devient le droit individuel et personnel du locataire. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la bande, entendu dans son sens technique et juridique, a disparu ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. [\u2026]\n17 [\u2026] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne crois tout simplement pas que la Couronne soit soumise \u00e0 des obligations de fiduciaire lorsqu\u2019elle exerce le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le paragraphe 58(3). Dans l\u2019affaire Guerin, il \u00e9tait question de terrains non attribu\u00e9s faisant partie d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, terrains qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la Couronne afin qu\u2019elle consente \u00e0 leur sujet un bail \u00e0 long terme ou vende ces terrains \u00e0 des conditions favorables \u00e0 la bande. Selon mon interpr\u00e9tation du jugement, c\u2019est \u00e0 cause de toutes ces circonstances qu\u2019il a pu \u00eatre dit qu\u2019une obligation de caract\u00e8re fiduciaire \u00e9tait n\u00e9e : en effet, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de la bande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 au Ministre lors de la cession des terrains et \u00e9tait en jeu au moment de leur ali\u00e9nation. Lorsqu\u2019un bail est consenti en vertu du paragraphe 58(3), les circonstances sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes : aucune ali\u00e9nation n\u2019est envisag\u00e9e et le droit qui sera transf\u00e9r\u00e9 temporairement est le droit \u00e0 l\u2019usage d\u2019un terrain, droit qui appartient individuellement \u00e0 l\u2019Indien qui en a possession [...]\n18 La conclusion me semble \u00e9vidente. Consid\u00e9rant la structure de la Loi sur les Indiens et la clart\u00e9 du libell\u00e9 de son paragraphe 58(3), il n\u2019existe aucun motif de croire que le Ministre est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le consentement de la bande ou de son conseil avant de consentir un bail comme celui dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il semble que cette Loi, dont l\u2019esprit paternaliste a fait l\u2019objet de tant de critiques, ait n\u00e9anmoins jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019accorder \u00e0 chaque membre de la bande une certaine autonomie, et une ind\u00e9pendance relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des dicta de son conseil de bande dans l\u2019exercice de son esprit d\u2019entreprise et la mise en valeur de son terrain.\nVI. Plainte de discrimination - conclusions [51] Les plaignants soutiennent que le MAINC a contrevenu \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP en les privant d\u2019un service ou en les d\u00e9favorisant \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture d\u2019un service en raison de leur origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[52] Dans le traitement de la demande des plaignants pour un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location, le MAINC s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur des crit\u00e8res et des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans son Guide de la gestion des terres afin de tenter de d\u00e9terminer si la transaction propos\u00e9e par M. Louie \u00e9tait viable et \u00e0 son avantage. Dans le cadre de ce processus, le MAINC a demand\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendante afin de d\u00e9terminer la juste valeur marchande, sans tenir compte de l\u2019accord de coentreprise des plaignants et, en novembre 2008, le MAINC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Louie d\u2019\u00e9tablir, \u00e0 la satisfaction du minist\u00e8re, une preuve de [traduction] \u00ab sa capacit\u00e9 et sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 conclure la transaction propos\u00e9e \u00bb. (Pi\u00e8ce A-1.167)\n[53] Le MAINC a tent\u00e9 d\u2019imposer un pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral sur tous les aspects de la proposition de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants. Pendant le traitement de la demande de M. Louie, les agents du MAINC \u00e9taient d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de leur \u00ab devoir \u00bb d\u2019intervenir afin de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. Louie \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien inscrit et de dicter la nature et les modalit\u00e9s du bail demand\u00e9. Ce faisant, ils ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont la Loi est devenue un anachronisme qui est contraire \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et aux droits de la personne individuels garantis auxquels tous les Canadiens ont droit.\n[54] L\u2019attitude paternaliste du MAINC envers M. Louie a \u00e9t\u00e9 avalis\u00e9e et soutenue sans \u00e9quivoque par le ministre Chuck Strahl dans sa lettre \u00e0 M. Louie le 15 mai 2008. Le ministre a carr\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Louie ne pouvait pas dicter les modalit\u00e9s du bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location qu\u2019il demandait, et il a soutenu qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab un rapport fiduciaire est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [\u2026] lorsque le Canada contracte des baux de certificats de possession. [\u2026] En vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer revient au Canada et ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, sauf par modification de la loi. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et une d\u00e9charge ne modifiera pas le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s du bail, qui comprennent aussi, sans s\u2019y limiter, des dispositions quant \u00e0 l\u2019environnement. \u00bb [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[55] Le ministre avait tort. Il n\u2019existe aucune obligation fiduciaire dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3). De plus, l\u2019exercice unilat\u00e9ral du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne serait pas judicieux et annulerait l\u2019objet du paragraphe 58(3), qui vise \u00e0 faciliter la location de terres par des propri\u00e9taires fonciers individuels indiens qui y voient un avantage (voir Boyer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[56] La demande de bail minist\u00e9riel des plaignants \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un accord de coentreprise en vertu duquel Mme Beattie construirait une maison unifamiliale sur la terre lou\u00e9e et la vendrait ensuite \u00e0 un prix et selon des modalit\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient acceptables pour M. Louie, et le produit net de la vente serait divis\u00e9 entre M. Louie et Mme Beattie. Le loyer de 1 $ n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur la valeur r\u00e9elle de la terre et il ne s\u2019agissait pas de l\u2019avantage que M. Louie cherchait \u00e0 obtenir dans le cadre de la coentreprise. Les avantages que M. Louie et Mme Beattie souhaitaient obtenir \u00e9taient la construction d\u2019une maison unifamiliale sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e et sa vente \u00e9ventuelle. Plut\u00f4t que de se concentrer sur la demande de bail dans le contexte plus large de l\u2019accord de coentreprise, et des avantages qui en d\u00e9coulaient pour M. Louie, les agents du MAINC ont insist\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9parer un bail conform\u00e9ment aux exigences applicables du Guide de la gestion des terres, y compris des recettes de location avantageuses sur une p\u00e9riode de 49 ans \u00e9tablies en fonction d\u2019une \u00e9valuation de la terre dans son \u00e9tat am\u00e9lior\u00e9 prospectif.\n[57] Le refus du MAINC d\u2019accepter le fait que M. Louie avait le droit de d\u00e9terminer les avantages dont il pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son association d\u2019affaires avec Mme Beattie a immobilis\u00e9 le processus de demande. En pratique, la demande des plaignants pour un bail minist\u00e9riel selon les modalit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils s\u2019\u00e9taient entendus a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le ministre dans sa lettre du 15 mai 2008 \u00e0 M. Louie. La lettre du ministre a exacerb\u00e9 le traitement discriminatoire dont le MAINC a fait preuve envers les plaignants.\n[58] Bien que la question n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il convient de noter que le 18 juin 2008, un peu plus d\u2019un mois apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Louie, le ministre a annonc\u00e9 que la loi assurant la protection des droits de la personne \u00e0 toutes les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations avait re\u00e7u la sanction royale. \u00ab L\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u201121, Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, constitue un point tournant dans la relation entre les Premi\u00e8res nations et le gouvernement du Canada \u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le ministre Strahl. \u00ab Elle souligne l\u2019engagement solide pris par notre gouvernement en vue de prot\u00e9ger les droits de la personne pour tous les Canadiens. \u00bb Cependant, cette annonce n\u2019a apparemment pas eu d\u2019effet sur les demandes des plaignants. Rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9, et la plainte qui m\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en est le r\u00e9sultat.\n[59] Comme la Loi est maintenant assujettie \u00e0 la LCDP, je conclus que le processus de demande pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3) doit devenir une fonction administrative habilitante qui reconna\u00eet et qui accepte que les Indiens inscrits (sauf ceux qui sont mineurs ou frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale) sont des Canadiens responsables qui sont capables d\u2019\u00e9valuer eux-m\u00eames les avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la location de leur terre et que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel ne doit pas \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on unilat\u00e9rale.\nVII. D\u00e9cision [60] Les plaignants ont \u00e9tay\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire, soit qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s d\u2019un service, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Ils ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens inscrits, ils s\u2019\u00e9taient vus refuser par les agents du MAINC, y compris par le ministre Strahl, l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services auxquels ils devaient avoir acc\u00e8s en application du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi.\n[61] Les plaignants ont droit \u00e0 des mesures de redressement en l\u2019absence d\u2019une justification de la part du MAINC.\n[62] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de pratique discriminatoire s\u2019il existe un motif justifiable pour le refus d\u2019offrir un service. Pour qu\u2019il existe un motif justifiable, le MAINC doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019accommodement des besoins des plaignants lui imposerait une contrainte excessive.\n[63] Le MAINC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli un motif justifiable au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15 (1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2).\nVIII. Les mesures de redressement [64] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit se conformer aux ordonnances suivantes :\n1) L\u2019intim\u00e9 examinera de nouveau les demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal;\n2) L\u2019intim\u00e9 modifiera son Guide de gestion des terres et prendra des mesures, en collaboration avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, afin de rajuster ses pratiques ou d\u2019\u00e9viter que des pratiques semblables soient utilis\u00e9es;\n3) L\u2019intim\u00e9 devra modifier son Guide de gestion des terres et toute autre politique afin de pr\u00e9voir que lorsque des occupants individuels (sauf ceux qui sont frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale ou qui sont mineurs) ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par eux-m\u00eames qu\u2019une transaction sera \u00e0 leur avantage, le MAINC acceptera ce choix et proc\u00e9dera au traitement du bail demand\u00e9 en fonction de ce choix;\n4) L\u2019intim\u00e9 se conformera aux ordonnances ci-jointes dans les six mois suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce;\n5) Le Tribunal conservera sa comp\u00e9tence et restera saisi de l\u2019affaire pendant neuf mois apr\u00e8s la date de la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, afin de recevoir des preuves suppl\u00e9mentaires, d\u2019entendre d\u2019autres arguments ou de rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires si les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou de l\u2019application des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

La plainte [1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Lincoln Dinning le 17 septembre 2007. Le fils de M. Dinning, le caporal Matthew Dinning, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tragiquement tu\u00e9 en Afghanistan en avril 2007 \u00e0 23 ans, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au service de son pays comme soldat pour les Forces canadiennes (FC). Lors d\u2019un d\u00e9c\u00e8s li\u00e9 au service d\u2019un membre des FC, une prestation forfaitaire de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de 250 000 $ (avec ajustement annuel pour l\u2019inflation), peut \u00eatre payable par le ministre des Anciens Combattants, en vertu du paragraphe 57(1) de la Loi sur les mesures de r\u00e9insertion et d\u2019indemnisation des militaires et v\u00e9t\u00e9rans des Forces canadiennes (la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants) sur demande, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb ou au \u00ab conjoint de fait \u00bb, \u00e0 titre de \u00ab survivant \u00bb, ou \u00e0 un \u00ab enfant \u00e0 charge \u00bb, au sens de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants.

M. Dinning a courageusement et avec grand chagrin compar\u00e9 la joie incroyable de voir grandir son fils talentueux, et de participer \u00e0 ses apprentissages, avec la douleur indescriptible que sa femme et lui ont connue apr\u00e8s la mort de Matthew. Sans surprise, il a d\u00e9crit la naissance de Matthew comme \u00e9tant la plus belle journ\u00e9e de sa vie, et sa mort, comme \u00e9tant la pire. Son t\u00e9moignage a fait comprendre, en d\u00e9tails peu rassurants et explicites, \u00e0 quel point la vie est \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, pr\u00e9caire et pr\u00e9cieuse, \u00e0 quel point la relation entre un parent et un enfant peut \u00eatre sp\u00e9ciale, et \u00e0 quel point la mort d\u2019un enfant est d\u00e9vastatrice. Personne, lors du t\u00e9moignage de Lincoln Dinning au sujet de son fils Matthew et des r\u00e9percussions de la mort de ce dernier, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 indiff\u00e9rent ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 peu impressionn\u00e9 par M. Dinning et la fa\u00e7on digne dont il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnaissant d\u2019avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Dinning et j\u2019esp\u00e8re que lui, son \u00e9pouse Laurie et son fils Brendon trouveront une fa\u00e7on de composer avec leur deuil. Je me sens exactement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on au sujet du t\u00e9moignage du fils et de deux \u00e9poux de soldats d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ils ont parl\u00e9 du deuil terrible qu\u2019ils ont subi et des grandes difficult\u00e9s auxquelles ils ont d\u00fb faire face lorsqu\u2019ils se sont r\u00e9ajust\u00e9s \u00e0 la vie civile en raison du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur p\u00e8re ou de leur \u00e9poux.\n[16] Dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a parl\u00e9 des r\u00e9percussions qu\u2019a eues la mort de Matthew sur lui, son \u00e9pouse Laurie et son fils Brendon. Ce t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019une des questions principales de l\u2019affaire portant sur l\u2019objet l\u00e9gal de la disposition au sujet de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants. Cet avantage particulier fait partie d\u2019un nouvel \u00ab ensemble \u00bb d\u2019avantages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits lors de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants le 6 avril 2006 afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la situation des membres des Forces canadiennes et de leur famille. Les parties se sont entendues \u00e0 l\u2019audience que, bien que l\u2019expression ne soit pas d\u00e9finie, la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est un paiement forfaitaire qui vise \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre et \u00e0 indemniser un survivant ou un enfant \u00e0 charge d\u2019un membre des Forces arm\u00e9es pour les r\u00e9percussions non \u00e9conomiques du d\u00e9c\u00e8s soudain en service du membre sur le fonctionnement du m\u00e9nage. Le t\u00e9moignage que le plaignant a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait le suivant :\n[traduction]\nLe fondement m\u00eame de la famille est d\u00e9truit apr\u00e8s la mort d\u2019un enfant.\nUne famille est normalement compos\u00e9e d\u2019une m\u00e8re, d\u2019un p\u00e8re et des enfants et, lorsque votre enfant meurt, votre conception de la famille meurt.\nIl y a toujours eu quatre personnes dans nos photos de famille, maintenant il n\u2019en reste que trois.\nLa perte des espoirs et des r\u00eaves en l\u2019avenir. Le fait d\u2019\u00eatre incapable de voir Matthew grandir, se marier, avoir des enfants, \u00eatre un p\u00e8re, \u00eatre un grand-p\u00e8re. Je sais qu\u2019il y aurait excell\u00e9.\nNo\u00ebl, les anniversaires, les f\u00eates ne sont plus les m\u00eames depuis que Matthew n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 pour les partager avec nous.\nLes amis de Matthew se marient et ont des enfants et nous ne vivrons jamais \u00e7a.\nLes pertes de m\u00e9moire, les nuits blanches, le sentiment de culpabilit\u00e9.\nComme parents, c\u2019est votre devoir de prot\u00e9ger vos enfants. Qu\u2019ils aient trois ans ou 23 ans, vous voulez les prot\u00e9ger et, dans le cas de Matthew, nous ne l\u2019avons pas fait.\nNous rions moins. Nous pleurons plus.\nNous avons perdu un fils, un petit-fils, un fr\u00e8re, un ami.\nBrendon, son seul fr\u00e8re, ne pourra pas avoir Matthew comme gar\u00e7on d\u2019honneur \u00e0 son mariage, s\u2019il se marie.\nChaque c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de rapatriement nous ram\u00e8ne un flot de souvenirs et nos c\u0153urs se serrent pour les familles nouvellement endeuill\u00e9es.\nEntendre une chanson, voir un film, regarder une photo, regarder une partie d\u2019hockey ou de rugby d\u2019enfants ram\u00e8ne des souvenirs de notre vie avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Matthew.\nNotre bataille avec le gouvernement n\u2019a fait qu\u2019ajouter du stress \u00e0 nos vies quotidiennes. Cela nous a fait sentir comme des citoyens de seconde classe. Tout ce que le gouvernement dit au sujet de l\u2019appui aux troupes et \u00e0 leur famille ne semble plus tenir lorsqu\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire est tu\u00e9.\nDes \u00e9tudes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les parents dont un enfant d\u00e9c\u00e8de ont des vies plus courtes.\nLes relations avec la famille et les amis sont diff\u00e9rentes et certaines n\u2019existent plus. Des gens qui \u00e9taient nos amis ne savent pas quoi dire, alors ils restent loin. Il semble que cela soit habituel apr\u00e8s la mort d\u2019un enfant.\nNous recevons encore du counseling pour les endeuill\u00e9s. Laurie y a toujours recours, cinq ans apr\u00e8s la mort de Matthew, et conduit deux heures pour se rendre \u00e0 chacun de ses rendez-vous.\nNous nous demandons toujours \u00ab comment serait la vie si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas arriv\u00e9 \u00bb?\nNous nous ennuyons de son rire, de son sourire, de sa voix. Il n\u2019y a plus d\u2019appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, plus de courriels, plus d\u2019histoire de ses aventures, plus de taquineries avec son fr\u00e8re. Il n\u2019y a plus de bi\u00e8re sur la galerie arri\u00e8re et de discussions au sujet des plans qu\u2019il faisait pour son avenir.\nLa mort d\u2019un enfant est la pire chose qu\u2019une personne peut vivre. Lorsqu\u2019on se marie, on dit \u00ab jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la mort nous s\u00e9pare \u00bb. On sait et on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un jour, l\u2019\u00e9poux meure. Mais on ne s\u2019attend jamais \u00e0 ce que notre enfant meure. Un parent ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 enterrer ses enfants.\nLorsqu\u2019un de vos parents meurt, vous perdez votre pass\u00e9.\nLorsque votre \u00e9poux meurt, vous perdez votre pr\u00e9sent.\nSi votre enfant meurt, vous perdez votre avenir.\nVotre honneur, je ne souhaite pas \u00e7a \u00e0 mon pire ennemi.\nAlors, lorsque le minist\u00e8re des Anciens Combattants croit que les parents et les fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnus pour la perte de conseils, de soins et de camaraderie, et que notre m\u00e9nage fonctionnera correctement sans Matthew, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord.\n[17] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son \u00e9pouse et lui ne d\u00e9pendaient pas financi\u00e8rement de Matthew au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Cependant, ils d\u00e9pendaient de Matthew d\u2019autres fa\u00e7ons. Comme le plaignant l\u2019a \u00e9crit dans ses observations du 27 d\u00e9cembre 2009 en r\u00e9ponse au rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission :\n[traduction]\nJe pouvais compter sur Matthew pour faire tout ce que je lui demandais. Je pouvais compter sur lui pour couper la pelouse ou passer la souffleuse dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la maison. Je pouvais compter sur lui pour me faire sourire lorsqu\u2019il me racontait des histoires de sa carri\u00e8re et de ses nombreux accomplissements. Je pouvais compter sur lui pour m\u2019\u00e9couter \u00e0 titre de coll\u00e8gue policier, lorsque j\u2019avais eu une journ\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement difficile au travail et que j\u2019avais besoin de parler \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un. Pour l\u2019avenir, je comptais sur Matthew pour me donner des petits-enfants et pour prendre soin de moi dans mon vieil \u00e2ge. Vous voyez, la d\u00e9pendance existe sous de nombreuses facettes. Je n\u2019ai qu\u2019\u00e0 penser \u00e0 ma m\u00e8re veuve de 82 ans qui habite \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la maison de mon fr\u00e8re. Mon fr\u00e8re et elle s\u2019offrent mutuellement des conseils, des soins et de la camaraderie.\n[18] Le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont fourni aucune preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet des r\u00e9percussions de la mort d\u2019un autre membre des Forces arm\u00e9es sur sa famille. Comme je l\u2019ai not\u00e9, ni Laurie, ni Brendon Dinning n\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de victime de discrimination sur le formulaire de plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il souhaitait faire inclure Brendon dans sa plainte parce que, si sa plainte \u00e9tait re\u00e7ue, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019obtenir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s en raison de son propre d\u00e9c\u00e8s, il souhaitait que son fils survivant, Brendon, la re\u00e7oive afin qu\u2019une personne dans la famille Dinning ait re\u00e7u la prestation d\u00e9coulant de la mort de Matthew. La Commission n\u2019a pas appuy\u00e9 l\u2019ajout du fr\u00e8re \u00e0 la plainte.\n[19] Le plaignant n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve ni observation au sujet de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP et la Commission n\u2019a pas appuy\u00e9 la plainte au sujet de l\u2019article 10.\n[20] Pendant tout le d\u00e9roulement de cette affaire (y compris apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, comme je le d\u00e9crirai plus tard), le plaignant a toujours maintenu la position selon laquelle sa pr\u00e9occupation portait sur la diff\u00e9rence de traitement qu\u2019il percevait de son fils, le caporal Dinning, \u00e0 titre de soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, dont la famille ne pouvait pas obtenir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, par rapport \u00e0 un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, dont certains membres de la famille pouvaient obtenir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s en vertu de l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants. \u00c0 ce sujet, il a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage les exemples qui suivent :\n[traduction]\nDeux soldats conduisent en Jeep et ils sont tous les deux tu\u00e9s par une bombe qui explose pr\u00e8s de la route. Le conducteur, qui est mari\u00e9, a droit \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Le passager, qui est c\u00e9libataire, n\u2019y a pas droit. En quoi cela est-il \u00e9gal?\nLorsque nos soldats tomb\u00e9s au combat reviennent \u00e0 la base des Forces canadiennes de Trenton, le cort\u00e8ge fun\u00e9raire se dirige vers le nord sur la 401. Les soldats mari\u00e9s ne tournent pas \u00e0 droite et les soldats c\u00e9libataires, \u00e0 gauche.\nIls suivent tous l\u2019Autoroute des H\u00e9ros et sont accueillis \u00e0 la maison de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale.\nLe plaignant \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable et constituait un manque de respect et cela lui donnait \u00e0 penser que l\u2019intim\u00e9 traitait la vie de feu son fils comme valant moins que la vie d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\n[21] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l\u2019argent n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019objet de sa plainte, mais qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9e sur les principes. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne serait jamais capable de remplacer son fils, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiel que le gouvernement traite de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable tous les soldats qui meurent \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une blessure li\u00e9e au service, qu\u2019ils soient mari\u00e9s ou c\u00e9libataires, et que ce traitement devait \u00eatre gouvern\u00e9 par la g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 et non par la logique, peu importe le caract\u00e8re coh\u00e9rent ou justifiable du traitement actuel. Le plaignant \u00e9tait tellement ax\u00e9 sur ce th\u00e8me que la seule question qu\u2019il a pos\u00e9e \u00e0 presque chacun des 10 t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait celle de savoir s\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que le gouvernement devait traiter les soldats c\u00e9libataires d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s et les soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\n[22] De plus, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte dans le but de priver un \u00e9poux, un conjoint de fait ou un enfant \u00e0 charge d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s actuellement disponible en vertu de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants ou de faire r\u00e9duire le paiement de cette prestation \u00e0 l\u2019une de ces personnes. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pendant l\u2019audience, et depuis l\u2019audience, qui s\u2019il y avait eu de tels survivants ou enfants \u00e0 charge dans le cas du caporal Dinning, il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte et ne se serait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du m\u00eame avis que la Commission, qui soutenait que la loi pertinente \u00e9tait discriminatoire en n\u2019incluant pas les parents de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires possibles de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s. \u00c0 ce sujet, la discussion suivante a eu lieu entre le plaignant et moi lors du t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019audience :\n[traduction]\nLe Membre : M. Dinning, j\u2019ai une seule question. Que ce soit un soldat mari\u00e9 ou un soldat c\u00e9libataire qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, dans les deux cas, les parents et les fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Actuellement, ils n\u2019obtiennent pas d\u2019avantages?\nM. Dinning : C\u2019est \u00e7a, oui.\nLe Membre : D\u2019accord. Et vous sugg\u00e9rez que le traitement est le m\u00eame, les parents sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, qu\u2019ils soient parents d\u2019une personne mari\u00e9e ou c\u00e9libataire, votre position, je suppose, serait que \u2013 dans les deux cas, ils devraient obtenir un avantage \u00e0 titre de parents d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 autant qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de parents \u2013\nM. Dinning : Non, je ne dis pas \u00e7a du tout. Non, ce que je dis, c\u2019est gardez les choses comme elles sont. Si vous avez une \u00e9pouse, elle obtient la prestation. Si vous avez un enfant \u00e0 charge, il obtient la prestation. Mais s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune conjointe de fait, aucune \u00e9pouse, alors les parents obtiennent la prestation parce qu\u2019ils sont les prochains \u2013 les proches parents, la famille imm\u00e9diate.\nLe Membre : Donc dans le cas d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 \u2013\nM. Dinning : Mmhmm.\nLe Membre : -- il n\u2019y aurait pas de paiement a un parent, il n\u2019y aurait pas de --\nM. Dinning : Non non, l\u2019\u00e9pouse re\u00e7oit tout, c\u2019est \u00e7a. Non, je ne dis pas d\u2019enlever quoi que ce soit, non non non. Ils l\u2019obtiennent, ils le gardent, l\u2019\u00e9pouse l\u2019obtient, les conjointes de fait si le soldat et elles ont habit\u00e9 ensemble pendant un an et satisfont \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res, elles l\u2019obtiennent. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019\u00e9pouse, comme pour certains soldats c\u00e9libataires, c\u00e9libataires dans le sens qu\u2019ils ne sont pas mari\u00e9s, mais qu\u2019ils ont des enfants, alors l\u2019enfant l\u2019obtient, d\u2019accord. Mais s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas \u2013 si un soldat c\u00e9libataire n\u2019a pas d\u2019\u00e9pouse ni d\u2019enfants, les parents pourraient ou devraient l\u2019obtenir et je dirais m\u00eame plus, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de parents, alors le fr\u00e8re ou la s\u0153ur l\u2019obtient. Et s\u2019il n\u2019y a personne, absolument personne, alors la succession l\u2019obtient, d\u2019accord.\nParce que l\u2019un des hommes qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps que Matthew, William Turner, n\u2019avait pas de m\u00e8re. Il avait 40 ans, n\u2019avait pas de m\u00e8re ni de p\u00e8re, ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s. Il avait une s\u0153ur, d\u2019accord. Encore une fois, il est c\u00e9libataire, il n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Donc dans son cas, la s\u0153ur serait la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nLe Membre : Pensez-vous que, si c\u2019est ce qui \u00e9tait fait, les parents de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s trouveraient qu\u2019ils sont trait\u00e9s d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente des parents de soldats c\u00e9libataires d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s?\nM. Dinning : Je ne pense pas du tout parce que \u2013 si Matthew avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9 et avait eu des enfants, l\u2019\u00e9pouse aurait obtenu la prestation et nous n\u2019aurions rien dit. Je veux dire, c\u2019est comme \u00e7a que \u00e7a devrait se passer. Non il n\u2019y a pas \u2013 je ne crois pas \u2013 je ne crois pas que des parents contrediraient \u00e7a. Je veux dire, ils sont mari\u00e9s.\nQuand \u2013 quand vous vous mariez et que vous avez des enfants, alors vous avez une famille imm\u00e9diate diff\u00e9rente, d\u2019accord? Le soldat aura toujours une m\u00e8re et un p\u00e8re, \u00e9videmment, mais si la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse ou \u00e0 l\u2019enfant, je ne pense pas que les parents s\u2019en plaindraient. Je ne m\u2019en plaindrais certainement pas.\n[23] Dans ses conclusions finales, le plaignant a soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui et envers son fils en ne leur donnant pas la m\u00eame occasion de recevoir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s en vertu de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants \u00e0 titre de parent et de fr\u00e8re d\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 que s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9poux, un conjoint de fait ou un enfant \u00e0 charge d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\n[24] Dans ses conclusions finales, la Commission a soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait agi et agissait de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en ne payant pas de prestations de d\u00e9c\u00e8s aux parents de soldats qui sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s en service, peu importe l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille du soldat d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Comme je l\u2019ai not\u00e9 plut\u00f4t, le plaignant ne souscrit pas \u00e0 la position de la Commission au sujet du fait que la loi est trop limitative en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que la position de la Commission en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e de la loi pour les parents de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte, a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate de la part de la Commission ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[25] Les parties ont convenu \u00e0 l\u2019audience que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s pr\u00e9vue dans la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants \u00e9tait essentielle au jugement de l\u2019affaire sur le fond. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 16, la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s n\u2019est pas un terme d\u00e9fini dans la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, mais elle vise \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre et \u00e0 indemniser un \u00e9poux, un conjoint de fait ou un enfant \u00e0 charge survivant d\u2019un membre des Forces canadiennes pour les r\u00e9percussions non \u00e9conomiques du d\u00e9c\u00e8s soudain du membre li\u00e9 au service, qui comprend la perte de vie du membre et la perte de conseils, de soins et de camaraderie qui en d\u00e9coule, ainsi que pour les r\u00e9percussions du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du membre sur le fonctionnement du m\u00e9nage.\n[26] Dans ses observations \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a demand\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019objectif de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s comme partie int\u00e9grante d\u2019un \u00ab ensemble \u00bb d\u2019avantages pr\u00e9vus par la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, qui ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9s examin\u00e9s, con\u00e7us et vis\u00e9s attentivement par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 titre de programme de r\u00e9tablissement \u00e0 la vie civile, afin d\u2019aider les membres de la famille en particulier (les \u00e9poux, les conjoints de fait et les enfants \u00e0 charge) qui suivent normalement les membres des Forces arm\u00e9es dans leur carri\u00e8re et deviennent une partie de la \u00ab famille militaire \u00bb et qui sont les plus touch\u00e9s en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leur besoin de r\u00e9tablir leur vie apr\u00e8s la mort soudaine d\u2019un membre li\u00e9e au service. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un exercice parfaitement rationnel et l\u00e9gitime du gouvernement pour l\u2019allocation appropri\u00e9e de fonds visant \u00e0 aider les membres de la famille qui en ont le plus besoin et il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire visant \u00e0 exclure d\u2019autres membres de la famille, tels que les parents, qui n\u2019ont pas les m\u00eames besoins. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, en concevant et en mettant en \u0153uvre la loi portant sur la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, rien n\u2019a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser, ni dans les groupes de consultations, ni dans les \u00e9tudes effectu\u00e9es r\u00e9cemment, que les parents ont besoin de cette aide.\n[27] \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la Commission m\u2019a demand\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019objectif de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 titre de paiement forfaitaire non \u00e9conomique pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment li\u00e9 au deuil que subissent les divers membres de la famille survivants d\u2019un soldat d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 qui se distingue clairement d\u2019un avantage \u00e9conomique visant le r\u00e9tablissement \u00e0 la vie civile fourni par divers avantages et programmes pr\u00e9vus dans d\u2019autres parties de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de r\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un groupe limit\u00e9 de membres de la famille survivants (\u00e9poux, conjoints de fait et enfants \u00e0 charge) apr\u00e8s la mort soudaine d\u2019un membre des Forces arm\u00e9es li\u00e9e au service. Selon la Commission, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire que d\u2019exclure du paiement de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s les membres de la famille tels que les parents qui subissent aussi un deuil en raison du d\u00e9c\u00e8s soudain, des suites d\u2019une blessure li\u00e9e au service, d\u2019un fils ou d\u2019une fille dans l\u2019arm\u00e9e.\nIII. La question du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique [28] Au cours de l\u2019audience, les parties et m\u2019ont avis\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019une demande en attente pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 par Mme Tanya Lowerison pour la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, fond\u00e9e sur le fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la conjointe de fait du caporal Dinning lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que Mme Lowerison avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour l\u2019obtention de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, mais que par la suite, en raison d\u2019un changement aux r\u00e8gles portant sur la p\u00e9riode requise de cohabitation pendant le d\u00e9ploiement, Mme Lowerison avait obtenu la permission de pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande, qui \u00e9tait alors en examen. J\u2019ai avis\u00e9 les parties que la demande en attente de Mme Lowerison n\u2019aurait aucune r\u00e9percussion sur ma d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration sauf si, avant que je rende une d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019\u00e9tais avis\u00e9 que la demande de Mme Lowerison avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie.\n[29] Le 10 juin 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conclu pour la premi\u00e8re fois que (i) Mme Lowerison \u00e9tait une \u00ab conjointe de fait \u00bb et une \u00ab survivante \u00bb de feu caporal Dinning, (ii) sa fille \u00e9tait une \u00ab enfant \u00e0 charge \u00bb de feu caporal Dinning et (iii) une prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s serait donc pay\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Lowerison et \u00e0 sa fille, selon une proportion qui respectait la loi applicable.\n[30] Le 17 juin 2011, le plaignant a \u00e9crit aux parties :\n[traduction]\nM\u00eame si ma demande en particulier peut \u00eatre \u00ab jet\u00e9e par la fen\u00eatre \u00bb, il reste 75 soldats c\u00e9libataires d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s qui sont touch\u00e9s par cette d\u00e9cision. Cela vous permettrait aussi d\u2019\u00e9viter de recommencer le processus au complet si une autre famille reprenait l\u00e0 o\u00f9 j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 et \u00e9viterait \u00e0 un autre tribunal plus tard de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur le m\u00eame sujet, pour un autre plaignant. (Je connais au moins trois familles qui poursuivraient la question.)\n\u00c0 aucun moment une preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un soldat d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en particulier, sauf pour le caporal Dinning, ou de membres particuliers de la famille d\u2019un tel soldat qui auraient mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 quiconque qu\u2019ils seraient touch\u00e9s par la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ou qui \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 agissait ou avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\n[31] Une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue avec les parties par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone le 13 juillet 2011 afin d\u2019examiner les observations portant sur l\u2019admission en preuve de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 Mme Lowerison et \u00e0 sa fille et afin de recevoir des observations au sujet de la question du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique, dans le cas o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 serait admise en preuve.\n[32] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance, j\u2019ai admis en preuve la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du caporal Dinning, il existait un survivant au sens de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, soit sa conjointe de fait Mme Lowerison et un enfant \u00e0 charge. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant et son fils Brendon n\u2019\u00e9taient pas, \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du caporal Dinning, le p\u00e8re et le fr\u00e8re, respectivement, d\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, tel que le plaignant le soutenait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cela ne veut pas dire que le plaignant, dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou de l\u2019instruction, a tromp\u00e9 qui que ce soit au sujet de son statut ou de celui de son fils puisque, avant le 10 juin 2011, aucune d\u00e9cision n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue qui aurait pu permettre \u00e0 M. Dinning de croire autre chose que ce qu\u2019il avait soutenu \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[33] Apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance du 13 juillet 2011, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour leur demander leurs observations sur les deux questions suivantes :\n[traduction]\n(1) La plainte du plaignant portant sur la responsabilit\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 est-elle maintenant th\u00e9orique? (2) Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question (1) ci-dessus est affirmative, peut-il y avoir une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en faveur d\u2019une autre personne?\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites au Tribunal. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu le 17 juillet 2011, la Commission a r\u00e9pondu le 9 septembre 2011 et l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu le 13 septembre 2011. La Commission a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations en r\u00e9ponse le 19 septembre 2011.\n[35] Les observations du plaignant sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9es au paragraphe 30 ci-dessus.\n[36] Les observations de la Commission se r\u00e9sument comme suit :\na) La question de la responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas th\u00e9orique. En vertu de la LCDP, la question renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction \u00e9tait celle de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait agi ou agissait de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. La LCDP n\u2019exige pas que le plaignant soit une \u00ab victime \u00bb de la pratique discriminatoire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en ne payant pas de prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s aux parents et aux fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs de soldats qui sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s en service et qui sont c\u00e9libataires et n\u2019ont aucun enfant. La Commission soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en ne payant pas de prestations de d\u00e9c\u00e8s aux parents des soldats qui sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s en service, peu importe leur \u00e9tat matrimonial ou leur situation de famille. Les all\u00e9gations ne sont pas affect\u00e9es par la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer une prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 Tanya Lowerison et \u00e0 sa fille. Il s\u2019agit de litiges actuels qui peuvent entra\u00eener des r\u00e9parations importantes qui seront d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, s\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019il y a responsabilit\u00e9.\nb) Subsidiairement, si le Tribunal conclue que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements r\u00e9cents rendent la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 th\u00e9orique, le Tribunal devrait n\u00e9anmoins exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de traiter des aspects d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de l\u2019affaire. Cela serait appropri\u00e9 parce que, entre autres, l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue au complet dans un d\u00e9bat contradictoire, elle porte sur des droits quasi constitutionnels d\u2019importance publique et elle vise une loi pr\u00e9cise et continue ainsi que les actions du gouvernement. De plus, le fait de trancher la question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de l\u2019affaire appuierait l\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire en \u00e9liminant ou en r\u00e9duisant la possibilit\u00e9 de contestation juridique dans l\u2019avenir. Cela respecterait aussi les principes selon lesquels les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet et que les litiges en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus de fa\u00e7on rapide et efficace.\nc) Bien que l\u2019allocation r\u00e9cente de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ne devrait pas affecter la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 ou le recours d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, elle affecte la disponibilit\u00e9 des mesures de redressement financi\u00e8res personnelles. Compte tenu du changement de situation, la Commission retire maintenant sa requ\u00eate en ordonnance pour le paiement de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s et soutient maintenant que l\u2019ordonnance appropri\u00e9e pour le Tribunal au sujet de sa position serait une ordonnance qui (i) conclut que les dispositions en mati\u00e8re de prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s font preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille en excluant les parents, (ii) ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de cesser d\u2019appliquer les aspects discriminatoires des dispositions, (iii) retarde l\u2019effet de l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9 afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prendre des mesures en consultation avec la Commission afin de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me, (iv) permet au Tribunal de rester saisi de l\u2019affaire afin de superviser l\u2019application de la mesure de redressement et (v) ordonne qu\u2019une fois que le l\u00e9gislateur aura modifi\u00e9 la loi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, l\u2019intim\u00e9 paie aux Dinning tout avantage que la nouvelle loi pr\u00e9voit pour les parents dans leur situation.\n[37] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 se r\u00e9sument comme suit :\na) Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination du plaignant peuvent \u00eatre th\u00e9oriques en partie ou en entier, selon ce que le Tribunal d\u00e9cide au sujet de la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\nb) Si le Tribunal interpr\u00e8te la plainte de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019une plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom des parents et des fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs de membres c\u00e9libataires des Forces arm\u00e9es qui sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s subitement en service, l\u2019allocation de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la conjointe de fait du caporal Dinning ne rend qu\u2019une partie de la plainte th\u00e9orique. La question de savoir si M. Dinning est victime de discrimination \u00e0 titre de p\u00e8re d\u2019un membre c\u00e9libataire des Forces arm\u00e9es n\u2019est plus en litige. Les parties s\u2019entendent que, pour l\u2019allocation de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, le fils de M. Dinning avait une conjointe de fait. Cependant, toutes les questions de fait et de droit portant sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les autres parents et fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs de membres c\u00e9libataires des forces arm\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination sont toujours en litige.\nc) Si le Tribunal conclue, cependant, que la plainte est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le plaignant (ou m\u00eame son \u00e9pouse et son fils Brendon) a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, alors l\u2019allocation de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s rend th\u00e9orique la plainte en entier.\nd) L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal de trancher une question th\u00e9orique. Aucun des trois crit\u00e8res justifiant l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne s\u2019applique :\ni) Premi\u00e8rement, il n\u2019existe plus de relation contradictoire entre les parties. L\u2019allocation de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la conjointe de fait du caporal Dinning y a mis fin. Toutes les parties conviennent que le caporal Dinning n\u2019est pas c\u00e9libataire aux fins de l\u2019allocation de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nii) Deuxi\u00e8mement, le besoin d\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire ne penche pas en faveur de l\u2019instruction de la question th\u00e9orique. Il n\u2019existe aucune circonstance sp\u00e9ciale justifiant que le Tribunal continue d\u2019attribuer ses ressources restreintes pour trancher la question. Une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal n\u2019aura aucun effet pratique sur les droits des parties. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que cette question est une question qui se r\u00e9p\u00e8te et qui n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es en contr\u00f4le. La prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es et il s\u2019agit de la premi\u00e8re plainte au nom d\u2019un parent d\u2019un membre c\u00e9libataire des Forces arm\u00e9es qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 soudainement en service. M\u00eame si un autre cas semblable arrivait dans l\u2019avenir, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce moment pour trancher la question.\niii) Enfin, si le Tribunal se pronon\u00e7ait sur cette question th\u00e9orique, cela serait vu comme si le Tribunal empi\u00e9tait sur le r\u00f4le de l\u2019organe l\u00e9gislatif. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas intervenir \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re dans la l\u00e9gislation du Parlement s\u2019il n\u2019existe pas un litige actuel qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9.\nIV. Analyse [38] La description et la d\u00e9finition classiques du principe du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique d\u2019une question proviennent de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Borowski c. Canada [1989] 1 R.C.S. 342 :\n15 La doctrine relative au caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique est un des aspects du principe ou de la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant qu\u2019un tribunal peut refuser de juger une affaire qui ne soul\u00e8ve qu\u2019une question hypoth\u00e9tique ou abstraite. Le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral s\u2019applique quand la d\u00e9cision du tribunal n\u2019aura pas pour effet de r\u00e9soudre un litige qui a, ou peut avoir, des cons\u00e9quences sur les droits des parties. Si la d\u00e9cision du tribunal ne doit avoir aucun effet pratique sur ces droits, le tribunal refuse de juger l\u2019affaire. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent non seulement quand l\u2019action ou les proc\u00e9dures sont engag\u00e9es, mais aussi au moment o\u00f9 le tribunal doit rendre une d\u00e9cision. En cons\u00e9quence, si, apr\u00e8s l\u2019introduction de l\u2019action ou des proc\u00e9dures, surviennent des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui modifient les rapports des parties entre elles de sorte qu\u2019il ne reste plus de litige actuel qui puisse modifier les droits des parties, la cause est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme th\u00e9orique. Le principe ou la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral s\u2019applique aux litiges devenus th\u00e9oriques \u00e0 moins que le tribunal n\u2019exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas l\u2019appliquer. J\u2019examinerai plus loin les facteurs dont le tribunal tient compte pour d\u00e9cider d\u2019exercer ou non ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n16 La d\u00e9marche suivie dans des affaires r\u00e9centes comporte une analyse en deux temps. En premier, il faut se demander si le diff\u00e9rend concret et tangible a disparu et si la question est devenue purement th\u00e9orique. En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question est affirmative, le tribunal d\u00e9cide s\u2019il doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et entendre l\u2019affaire. La jurisprudence n\u2019indique pas toujours tr\u00e8s clairement si le mot \u00ab th\u00e9orique \u00bb (moot) s\u2019applique aux affaires qui ne comportent pas de litige concret ou s\u2019il s\u2019applique seulement \u00e0 celles de ces affaires que le tribunal refuse d\u2019entendre. Pour \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019une affaire est \u00ab th\u00e9orique \u00bb si elle ne r\u00e9pond pas au crit\u00e8re du \u00ab litige actuel \u00bb. Un tribunal peut de toute fa\u00e7on choisir de juger une question th\u00e9orique s\u2019il estime que les circonstances le justifient.\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Collins c. Abrams et al 2002, Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie Britannique 1774, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie Britannique a \u00e9tabli les trois justifications sous-jacentes de la politique et de la pratique d\u2019application du principe du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique :\n[traduction]\n(1) La comp\u00e9tence d\u2019une cour de r\u00e9soudre des questions litigieuses est fond\u00e9e dans le syst\u00e8me adversatif et, en l\u2019absence d\u2019un d\u00e9bat contradictoire, tous les aspects de la cause ne seront peut-\u00eatre pas d\u00e9battus compl\u00e8tement (en reconnaissant qu\u2019un d\u00e9bat contradictoire peut survenir lorsqu\u2019il existe des cons\u00e9quences indirectes d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une cause d\u2019action d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9e);\n(2) Les ressources judiciaires doivent \u00eatre conserv\u00e9es pour le moment o\u00f9 elles sont n\u00e9cessaires (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, lorsque la d\u00e9cision de la cour aura un effet pratique sur les droits des parties, lorsque la d\u00e9cision de la cour est n\u00e9cessaire afin de garantir qu\u2019une question importante qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es le sera, ou lorsqu\u2019il existe une question d\u2019importance publique pour laquelle il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision, l\u2019utilisation de ressources judiciaires peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e);\net\n(3) Les cours doivent respecter leur fonction v\u00e9ritable dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration du droit et le fait de prononcer un jugement en l\u2019absence de litige affectant les droits des parties peut \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme une intrusion dans la sph\u00e8re de l\u2019organe l\u00e9gislatif.\nLa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e en appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Collins c. Abrams et al 2004, BCCA 96. Voir aussi OHRC c. Burrows and Ontario, 2004 HRTO 6.\n[39] \u00c0 mon avis, il est clair que la plainte du plaignant en son nom et au nom de son fils Brendon portait sur le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en ne lui permettant pas, ou en ne permettant pas \u00e0 son fils, d\u2019obtenir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, \u00e0 titre de parent ou de fr\u00e8re ou s\u0153ur, \u00e0 la mort du caporal Dinning, alors qu\u2019il permettait, hypoth\u00e9tiquement, \u00e0 certains membres de la famille (les \u00e9poux, les conjoints de fait et les enfants \u00e0 charge) de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, ou m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la conclusion de l\u2019audience, le plaignant ne savait \u00e9videmment pas que le caporal Dinning avait une conjointe de fait \u2013 Mme Lowerison \u2013 et un enfant \u00e0 charge lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 10 juin 2011, en application de l\u2019article 84 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e en preuve apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience. L\u2019effet de cette d\u00e9cision est que ni le plaignant, ni son fils Brendon, n\u2019est le parent ou le fr\u00e8re ou s\u0153ur d\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 au sens de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte ou particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience s\u2019il avait su que le caporal Dinning avait une conjointe de fait ou un enfant \u00e0 charge au moment o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP portait sur la situation d\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et non d\u2019un soldat mari\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants.\n[40] \u00c0 mon avis, une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur le fond en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne peut plus avoir l\u2019effet de r\u00e9soudre une controverse qui affecte ou qui pourrait affecter les droits du plaignant lui-m\u00eame et de son fils Brendon. Des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont eu lieu qui affectent la relation des parties d\u2019une telle fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il n\u2019existe plus de litige actuel qui toucherait les droits du plaignant lui-m\u00eame et de son fils Brendon. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la plainte du plaignant, en son nom et au nom de son fils, est maintenant th\u00e9orique.\n[41] Compte tenu de ma conclusion au paragraphe 40, la question est maintenant celle de savoir s\u2019il existe toujours un litige actuel permettant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision sur le fond en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en ce qui a trait \u00e0 toute all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 a agi ou agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, envers toute autre personne ou victime, en les privant d\u2019un service (la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s) dans l\u2019application de l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, ou si la question est-elle compl\u00e8tement th\u00e9orique.\n[42] Il convient dans le pr\u00e9sent paragraphe de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des extraits de l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. Bien que des mesures de redressement purement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public soient possibles en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, en plus des mesures de redressement personnelles pr\u00e9vues au m\u00eame article, la LCDP est ax\u00e9e sur les plaintes. Dans le cas d\u2019une plainte portant sur l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, il doit d\u2019abord y avoir une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e qui soutient qu\u2019une personne a agi ou agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire au sens de cet article envers une personne ou une victime. C\u2019est le cas, que le plaignant soit la personne ou la victime (comme il l\u2019a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) ou que le plaignant ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte au nom d\u2019une autre personne ou victime (qui n\u2019est pas toujours identifi\u00e9e comme un individu en particulier). C\u2019est le cas, qu\u2019un consentement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu ou non aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une telle autre personne ou victime, au sens du paragraphe 40(2) de la LCDP. Ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie dans une telle plainte que des mesures de redressement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public peuvent \u00eatre impos\u00e9es, dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es, que des mesures de redressement personnelles soient aussi demand\u00e9es et impos\u00e9es ou non. Une contestation de la validit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la loi et l\u2019application de mesures de redressement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui y sont li\u00e9es, comme on le demande en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, n\u2019est pas permise par la LCDP, sauf dans le contexte d\u2019un processus ax\u00e9 sur la plainte.\n[43] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on me demande de rendre une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la validit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une intervention l\u00e9gislative importante en application de l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants parce qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que cet article est actuellement trop limitatif en ce qui a trait aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et qu\u2019il permet \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de refuser un service \u00e0 des personnes en raison de leur situation de famille ou de leur \u00e9tat matrimonial, de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a maintenant plus de conflit affectant les droits du plaignant lui-m\u00eame. Par cons\u00e9quent, une d\u00e9cision n\u2019aurait aucun effet pratique sur les droits du plaignant. Dans de telles circonstances, compte tenu des d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es, il faut faire tr\u00e8s attention \u00e0 ne pas empi\u00e9ter sur le r\u00f4le de l\u2019organe l\u00e9gislatif ou \u00e0 gaspiller les ressources judiciaires limit\u00e9es.\n[44] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle, en l\u2019absence de litige actuel impliquant le plaignant lui-m\u00eame, il faut examiner attentivement la plainte afin de d\u00e9terminer si elle contient un litige actuel suffisant impliquant d\u2019autres personnes ou victimes qui auraient cens\u00e9ment subi de la discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. C\u2019est d\u2019autant plus important que la validit\u00e9 ou l\u2019effet de la loi est maintenant la seule question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[45] \u00c0 ce sujet, la plainte, telle qu\u2019elle est cit\u00e9e au paragraphe 4, ne mentionne que les [traduction] \u00ab familles de soldats C\u00c9LIBATAIRES d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00bb \u00e0 titre de victimes de discrimination. Cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est-elle suffisante pour me permette de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur le fond en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris une contestation de la validit\u00e9 et de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la loi, alors que la plainte du plaignant m\u00eame est maintenant th\u00e9orique, compte tenu des conclusions de fait suivantes?\ni) Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 rende sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 29, le plaignant axait sa plainte sur ses propres circonstances, qu\u2019il croyait vraies \u2013 notamment, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le parent d\u2019un soldat c\u00e9libataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte sur le fondement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait une personne non affect\u00e9e par la loi qui d\u00e9posait simplement une plainte au nom de parents ou de familles non identifi\u00e9s de soldats c\u00e9libataires d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s par la loi. En fait, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte ou qu\u2019il ne se serait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience s\u2019il avait su que son fils, le caporal Dinning, avec une conjointe de fait lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Compte tenu des circonstances, il est tr\u00e8s probable que la Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 au sujet de la plainte, n\u2019a pas obtenu le consentement d\u2019autres personnes ou victimes au sens du paragraphe 40(2) de la LCDP, parce qu\u2019elle aussi croyait que le plaignant \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame une victime.\nii) Le plaignant ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 la position de la Commission en ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re trop limitatif de l\u2019article 57 de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants vis-\u00e0-vis les familles de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s. La plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin de reconna\u00eetre cette all\u00e9gation et, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019all\u00e9gation ne faisait pas partie de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal par la Commission et la Commission n\u2019a pas elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte au nom des familles de soldats mari\u00e9s d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s.\niii) La plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e avec l\u2019appui, l\u2019autorisation ou le consentement d\u2019un membre d\u2019une famille d\u2019un soldat d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, membre qui se serait d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant victime de discrimination par rapport \u00e0 la disposition sur la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Les seuls t\u00e9moins, autre que le plaignant, qui ont comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et qui \u00e9taient des membres de la famille de soldats d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet des r\u00e9percussions de la mort de leur p\u00e8re ou de leur \u00e9poux, \u00e0 titre de membres de la famille imm\u00e9diate dans la famille militaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous ne savons pas s\u2019il y a des membres de la famille de soldats d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s qui sont d\u2019avis qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sont victimes de discrimination ou qui sont d\u2019avis que la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants est trop limitative dans sa d\u00e9finition de survivant et devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e.\n[46] Compte tenu des faits qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et des d\u00e9cisions mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 38, je ne suis pas convaincu que la preuve est suffisante pour conclure qu\u2019il existe pour les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un litige actuel, maintenant que la plainte du plaignant lui-m\u00eame est th\u00e9orique. Rendre une d\u00e9cision dans ces circonstances n\u2019aurait pas l\u2019effet de r\u00e9soudre un litige qui affecte ou qui pourrait affecter les droits de l\u2019une des parties, parce que des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont eu lieu qui affectent la relation des parties de fa\u00e7on telle qu\u2019aucun litige actuel n\u2019existe. Il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9conomiser les ressources judiciaires limit\u00e9es. Le principe du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique ne s\u2019applique pas dans les situations o\u00f9 le fait de l\u2019appliquer permettrait \u00e0 certaines questions de ne pas \u00eatre r\u00e9solues \u2013 ce qui est peu probable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce que la loi est en vigueur depuis un certain temps et que rien n\u2019emp\u00eache des litiges actuels \u00e0 ce sujet d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9s afin de permettre \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes de contester les dispositions en question. Le fait de prononcer un jugement, en l\u2019absence de litige affectant les droits de l\u2019une des parties, comme ce serait le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce si je rendais une d\u00e9cision, empi\u00e9terait sur le r\u00f4le de l\u2019organe l\u00e9gislatif. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisque des interventions l\u00e9gislatives sont contest\u00e9es et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas clair qu\u2019il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nV. Ordonnance [47] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la plainte n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e parce que l\u2019affaire est devenue enti\u00e8rement th\u00e9orique. La plainte est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re trancher la question dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate plut\u00f4t que dans une lettre.\n[3] La question est urgente parce que les affectations pour 2012 seront effectu\u00e9es au cours des prochaines semaines et que Mme Cruden demande des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures pr\u00e9vues dans l'ordonnance.\n[4] La demande de pr\u00e9cisions porte sur le paragraphe 176, qui se lit comme suit :\nSur ce fondement, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 la DGPG au niveau PM-06 et de prendre avec elle les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019affecter dans un pays ami, faisant partie de ses trois premiers choix o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\n[5] La question en litige porte sur le moment o\u00f9 on doit appliquer l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante dans un pays ami, faisant partie de ses trois premiers choix o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\n[6] Mme Cruden est d'avis que l\u2019effet du paragraphe 176 est que l'acdi est tenue de lui trouver un poste dans le cycle d'affectation de 2012. Comme l'objet du paragraphe 176 est de rem\u00e9dier aux effets n\u00e9gatifs du d\u00e9faut de l\u2019ACDI d\u2019accommoder Mme Cruden en lui donnant un poste en 2009, le fait de retarder la mise en \u0153uvre de l'ordonnance jusqu'au cycle d'affectation de 2013 aggraverait le d\u00e9savantage que Mme Cruden a subi du d\u00e9faut de l\u2019ACDI de lui donner un poste en 2009.\n[7] Le 15 novembre 2011, Mme Cruden a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ACDI ses trois premiers choix de postes pour le processus d'affectation de 2012 qui est en cours. Mme Cruden a cibl\u00e9 deux postes : le Vietnam et les Philippines. L'ACDI a reconnu l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de Mme Cruden pour un poste au Vietnam (premier choix apr\u00e8s l'Afghanistan), mais selon Mme Cruden, l'ACDI est d'avis qu'elle devrait pr\u00e9parer un plan de carri\u00e8re.\n[8] Mme Cruden soutient qu'il n'y a pas de fondement pour le refus de lui attribuer un poste en 2012 au Vietnam. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le concours qui est en cours pour le cycle d'affectation de 2012. Elle poss\u00e8de toutes les qualifications essentielles et la majorit\u00e9 des qualifications constituant des atouts \u00e9tablies pour le poste. L'exp\u00e9rience que l\u2019ACDI a cibl\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un atout pour le poste, par exemple l'exp\u00e9rience dans les approches ax\u00e9es sur les programmes, peut \u00eatre offerte \u00e0 Mme Cruden avant le d\u00e9but de l'affectation \u00e0 l'automne 2012.\n[9] Mme Cruden a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autres arguments, dont j'ai tenu compte.\n[10] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations et soutient que la plaignante ne tente pas de faire changer la substance de la d\u00e9cision initiale ni de faire appliquer une mesure de redressement diff\u00e9rente de celle qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie. La plaignante demande des pr\u00e9cisions sur l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour la mise en \u0153uvre du paragraphe 176 de l'ordonnance.\n[11] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas dessaisi parce qu\u2019il a conserv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les mesures de redressement soient mises en \u0153uvre, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 184.\n[12] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des extraits de jurisprudence \u00e0 l'appui du fait que le Tribunal peut utiliser son pouvoir pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la lcdp) non seulement pour accorder des mesures de redressement efficaces, mais aussi pour rester saisi d'une large comp\u00e9tence lui permettant de rouvrir certaines questions afin de garantir que les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es seront bient\u00f4t mises en \u0153uvre. Lorsque le Tribunal garde comp\u00e9tence pour faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre, il garde aussi comp\u00e9tence pour, notamment, fournir des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires afin de pr\u00e9ciser et de compl\u00e9ter l'ordonnance initiale.\n[13] La Commission soutient que la LCDP est une loi r\u00e9paratrice qui vise \u00e0 cibler et \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination. Compte tenu de cet objectif, il est important que les mesures de redressement en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soient efficaces et harmonis\u00e9es au caract\u00e8re quasi\u2011constitutionnel des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. En effet, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a toujours conclu que la \u00ab fa\u00e7on principale de proc\u00e9der \u00bb en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne consiste non pas \u00e0 punir l'auteur de la discrimination, \u00ab [\u2026] mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 offrir une voie de recours aux victimes de la discrimination \u00bb.\n[14] La Commission demande au Tribunal de pr\u00e9ciser que les mesures de redressement pr\u00e9vues dans l'ordonnance doivent \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre le plus rapidement possible, ce qui signifie probablement le cycle d'affectation de 2012 plut\u00f4t que celui de 2013, \u00e0 moins que l'ACDI fournissent des arguments de poids justifiant pourquoi une affectation plus rapide n'est pas possible en raison des besoins op\u00e9rationnels.\n[15] La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autres arguments, dont j'ai tenu compte.\n[16] L'ACDI soutient que je suis functus officio (\u00ab s\u2019\u00e9tant acquitt\u00e9 de sa charge \u00bb) et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de jurisprudence \u00e0 l'appui de sa position. Elle soutient aussi que le Tribunal ne peut pas modifier sa d\u00e9cision. L'ACDI soutient que le Tribunal n'a pas gard\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence quant \u00e0 l'aspect de mise en \u0153uvre de son ordonnance. Cela peut \u00eatre mis en contraste avec le paragraphe 169 de la d\u00e9cision, dans lequel le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment not\u00e9 qu'il restait saisi de la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[17] L'ACDI soutient que de toute fa\u00e7on, l'ordonnance est claire et a \u00e9t\u00e9 attentivement \u00e9crite afin de fournir un certain niveau de souplesse et de discr\u00e9tion aux parties pour qu'elle soit mise en \u0153uvre de bonne foi.\n[18] L'ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire d'accorder \u00e0 la victime de la pratique discriminatoire, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e.\n[19] L'ACDI soutient qu'il n'est pas raisonnable d'affecter Mme Cruden dans le cycle d'affectation de 2012 parce que, contrairement \u00e0 ses affirmations, elle ne poss\u00e8de pas les qualit\u00e9s essentielles. L'ACDI s'est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 ce qu'elle obtienne ces qualifications le plus rapidement possible.\n[20] L'ACDI a fourni la r\u00e9ponse suivante :\n[traduction] [L\u2019]ACDI a l\u2019intention de trouver pour Mme Cruden, d\u00e8s que celle-ci reviendra de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2012, un poste (op\u00e9rationnel) appropri\u00e9 au sein de sa DGPG. Cette mesure servira de pr\u00e9curseur \u00e0 une affectation sur le terrain dans un pays ami, \u00e0 compter de 2013, affectation dans le cadre de laquelle l\u2019ACDI travaillera avec Mme Cruden en 2012 afin de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle acqui\u00e8re les comp\u00e9tences et les connaissances dont elle aura besoin pour accomplir avec succ\u00e8s son affectation sur le terrain. \u00c0 cette fin, un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini sera \u00e9labor\u00e9 avec Mme Cruden et mis en place, et ce plan sera ax\u00e9 sur des aspects tels que la gestion de programmes ou de projets internationaux, le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 dans le cadre de diverses modalit\u00e9s de programmes bilat\u00e9rales (comme les approches ax\u00e9es sur les programmes et le soutien budg\u00e9taire).\n[21] L'ACDI soutient aussi que les affectations sont des occasions pour lesquelles il y a beaucoup de comp\u00e9tition et qu'elles sont tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9es. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a jamais occup\u00e9 de poste op\u00e9rationnel ou bilat\u00e9ral. Bien que le fait d'avoir occup\u00e9 un poste bilat\u00e9ral ne qualifie pas n\u00e9cessairement les employ\u00e9s pour une affectation, l'exp\u00e9rience obtenue dans ces postes augmente leurs chances d'obtenir une affectation. L\u2019ACDI a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pris des mesures afin de cibler quel poste au sein de la DGPG pourrait int\u00e9resser la plaignante et a l'intention de travailler avec la plaignante afin d'\u00e9tablir un plan de formation qui lui donnera l'exposition \u00e0 tous les m\u00e9canismes d'ex\u00e9cution n\u00e9cessaires afin de la pr\u00e9parer pour une affectation.\n[22] L'ACDI a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autres observations, dont j'ai tenu compte.\nLa d\u00e9cision\nLe Tribunal est-il dessaisi en l'esp\u00e8ce?\n[23] Le fait que, dans le paragraphe 169, le Tribunal ait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment not\u00e9 qu'il restait saisi de la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires n'exclut pas l\u2019effet du paragraphe 184, dans lequel il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\nJe demeure saisie de la pr\u00e9sente affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties aient confirm\u00e9 la mise en application des conditions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance et de toute ordonnance suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[24] L'intention de ce paragraphe \u00e9tait de garder comp\u00e9tence au sujet de toutes les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es. La mention au paragraphe 169 visait \u00e0 garantir que des observations seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es afin d'aider le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision sur cet aspect de l'affaire, parce qu'il ne disposait pas de suffisamment de preuves pour rendre une ordonnance pr\u00e9cise au sujet des montants qui devaient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[25] En vertu du principe de droit de functus officio, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux ne peuvent revenir sur une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive, sauf lorsqu\u2019il y a eu un lapsus lors de sa r\u00e9daction, ou lorsqu\u2019il y a eu une erreur dans l\u2019expression de l\u2019intention manifeste du tribunal (voir Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 848, au paragraphe 19 (Chandler)). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le principe de functus officio s\u2019appliquait \u00e9galement aux tribunaux administratifs, encore que \u00ab [s]on application doit [...] \u00eatre plus souple et moins formaliste \u00bb (Chandler, au paragraphe 21). Selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler, il est possible qu\u2019un tribunal revienne sur une d\u00e9cision si sa loi habilitante porte \u00e0 croire que cela lui permettra d\u2019exercer les fonctions que ladite loi lui conf\u00e8re (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 22). En outre, le Tribunal peut rouvrir sa d\u00e9cision s\u2019il a omis de trancher une question qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit dans la proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a le pouvoir de trancher en vertu de la LCDP (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 23). Cependant, le Tribunal ne peut revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision simplement parce qu\u2019il a chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis, parce qu\u2019il a commis une erreur dans le cadre de sa comp\u00e9tence, ou parce que les circonstances ont chang\u00e9 (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 20). De plus, le fait qu\u2019une mesure de redressement est pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre mesure de redressement ne permet pas au Tribunal de rouvrir la proc\u00e9dure afin de changer de choix (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 23).\n[26] Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherche) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (C.F.) (Grover), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que la LCDP ne contienne aucune disposition autorisant express\u00e9ment le Tribunal \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions, le fait qu\u2019elle investisse le Tribunal de larges pouvoirs, ajout\u00e9 au fait qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re large de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner pleinement effet aux droits qu\u2019elle prot\u00e8ge, permet au Tribunal de rester saisi de l\u2019affaire sur certains points afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que les plaignants jouissent effectivement de la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il leur a accord\u00e9e (voir Grover, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 36). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 :\nLa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration d\u2019un employ\u00e9, victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires de son employeur, dans un poste qu\u2019il aurait occup\u00e9 si ces actes n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis est une r\u00e9paration qui est intrins\u00e8quement difficile \u00e0 mettre en application et qui peut donc exiger une certaine surveillance. [...] Dans bien des cas, le tribunal serait peut-\u00eatre mieux avis\u00e9 de donner des directives pour permettre aux parties d\u2019arranger elles-m\u00eames la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de l\u2019employ\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que de leur imposer une ordonnance qu\u2019elles n\u2019arriveront pas \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution.\n[...]\nDe toute \u00e9vidence, la Loi prescrit que la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e soit efficace et, en cons\u00e9quence, il faut dans certains cas que le tribunal soit habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce que ses ordonnances r\u00e9paratrices soient vraiment ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es. Ce serait contrecarrer l\u2019objectif de la l\u00e9gislation que d\u2019obliger le plaignant \u00e0 demander l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance non ambigu\u00eb devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte pour obtenir la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n(Grover, aux paragraphes 32 \u00e0 33)\n[27] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Moore, [1998] 4 C.F. 585 (Moore), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le raisonnement dans la d\u00e9cision Grover appuie la conclusion que le Tribunal jouit d'un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour rouvrir une affaire et que la question de savoir si ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est exerc\u00e9 convenablement par le Tribunal d\u00e9pendra des faits de chaque instance (voir Moore, au paragraphe 49). Tant dans la d\u00e9cision Grover que dans la d\u00e9cision Moore, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment gard\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence pour traiter des questions en litige dans ces affaires.\n[28] Compte tenu de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le Tribunal n'est pas functus officio et qu'il reste saisi de la question en l'esp\u00e8ce et de la mise en \u0153uvre de toutes les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\n[29] Cela dit, l'intention du paragraphe 176 \u00e9tait de placer, le mieux possible, la plaignante Mme Cruden dans le poste qu'elle aurait occup\u00e9 s'il n'y avait pas eu de pratique discriminatoire. Ce paragraphe visait aussi \u00e0 fournir des directives aux parties afin de leur permettre d'\u00e9tablir entre elles le d\u00e9tail de la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration en milieu de travail, plut\u00f4t que de leur imposer une ordonnance impraticable.\n[30] Le paragraphe 176 laisse une certaine discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de mettre en \u0153uvre l'ordonnance, en consultation avec la plaignante. L'intention de ce paragraphe n'\u00e9tait pas de permettre \u00e0 l'employeur d'affecter la plaignante \u00e0 un poste pour lequel elle n'avait pas les qualifications requises. Dans un autre ordre d'id\u00e9es, le paragraphe 176 ne donne pas \u00e0 l'ACDI le pouvoir de ne jamais affecter la plaignante \u00e0 un \u00ab pays amis \u00bb pour ce motif. L'employeur doit aider la plaignante \u00e0 obtenir une affectation, comme la mesure de redressement le pr\u00e9voit. De plus, cela s'applique m\u00eame si les affectations sont des occasions pour lesquelles il y a beaucoup de comp\u00e9tition et qui sont tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9es. Le fait que les affectations soient des occasions pour lesquelles il y a beaucoup de comp\u00e9tition ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher l'ACDI d'affecter la plaignante, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) : accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e.\n[31] Cela \u00e9tant dit, le cycle d'affectation de 2012 est-il la premi\u00e8re occasion raisonnable d'affecter la plaignante? Les observations sur la question sont contradictoires. Mme Cruden soutient qu'elle poss\u00e8de toutes les qualifications pour une affectation en 2012 au Vietnam, alors que l'ACDI soutient qu'il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de l'y envoyer.\n[32] Je note que la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait besoin de l'exp\u00e9rience sur place et qu'elle devait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la DGPG afin d'acqu\u00e9rir l'exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire pour son plan de carri\u00e8re, exp\u00e9rience qu'elle n'avait pas. La d\u00e9cision est \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice quant aux t\u00e9moignages entendus au sujet de la raison pour laquelle elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e et pour laquelle, s'il n\u2019en \u00e9tait de sa d\u00e9ficience, elle aurait obtenu une affectation en Afghanistan.\n[33] Sans douter de la bonne foi de l'intim\u00e9e ACDI, apr\u00e8s avoir lu les observations de cette derni\u00e8re et tenu compte du fait qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre une partie de l'ordonnance, j'aimerais obtenir des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires de la part des deux parties sur la question des qualifications et de l'exp\u00e9rience de la plaignante pour une affectation en 2012.\n[34] Comme 2012 semble \u00eatre la premi\u00e8re circonstance qui permette d'affecter la plaignante, si elle poss\u00e8de les qualifications et l'exp\u00e9rience pour le poste, pourquoi serait-il d\u00e9raisonnable ou raisonnable d'affecter Mme Cruden au Vietnam apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait travaill\u00e9 quelques mois \u00e0 la DGPG?\n[35] Afin d'aider le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre la question, il serait pratique d'obtenir une copie de la fiche d'affectation et des qualifications et de l'exp\u00e9rience requises pour l'affectation de 2012 au Vietnam. Je demande aux deux parties de pr\u00e9senter des observations afin de m'aider \u00e0 comprendre la question en litige.\n[36] Je suis d'avis que l'ACDI, en l'esp\u00e8ce, serait mieux plac\u00e9e pour fournir l'information en premier.\n[37] J'ordonne \u00e0 l'ACDI de pr\u00e9senter ses observations au plus tard le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2011 et \u00e0 la plaignante Mme Cruden et \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations au plus tard le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2011.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1466\/1210\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Bronwyn Cruden c.

La requ\u00eate [1] Le 26 septembre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien (le MAINC), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en jonction de la plainte de Roger William Andrews (dossier du Tribunal T1686\/4111) et de la plainte de Roger William Andrews pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de sa fille Michelle Dominique Andrews (dossier du Tribunal T1725\/8011). La r\u00e9ponse finale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le 12 octobre 2011. Le plaignant dans les deux dossiers, M. Roger William Andrews, se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame et s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes.\nII. Le contexte [2] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes \u00e0 la Commission. Dans la premi\u00e8re plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 20 octobre 2008, le plaignant soutient que le MAINC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP), en raison de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, de la situation de famille et de l\u2019\u00e2ge. Selon le plaignant, le MAINC a rejet\u00e9 la demande de statut d\u2019Indien inscrit de sa fille parce qu\u2019elle est n\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 17 avril 1985. En cons\u00e9quence de ce refus de lui accorder un statut, elle s\u2019est vu refuser les services offerts par le MAINC et s\u2019est aussi vu refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s complet \u00e0 sa culture.\n[3] Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom de sa fille le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2010, le plaignant soutient que le MAINC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, en raison de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et de la situation de famille. Selon M. Andrews, en raison de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de son p\u00e8re, il a obtenu le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit au sens du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au sens du paragraphe 6(1) de la m\u00eame loi. En raison de son statut accord\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 6(2), il n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de services, tels que les soins de sant\u00e9 et le financement pour les \u00e9tudes, avant 1985. De plus, en raison de son statut au sens du paragraphe 6(2), ses filles n\u2019ont pas pu obtenir le statut d\u2019Indien\ninscrit au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens et n\u2019ont pas pu obtenir les avantages qui en d\u00e9coulent, elles ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie de la collectivit\u00e9 et de la culture des Premi\u00e8res Nations et elles sont victimes de discrimination.\n[4] En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de 2008 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour instruction le 4 avril 2011. La plainte de 2010 a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction le 11 ao\u00fbt 2011. La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle participerait aux audiences des deux plaintes.\n[5] Le 14 septembre 2011, M me Shirish P. Chotalia, c.r., la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate serait tranch\u00e9e sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sidente pour statuer sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nIII. Les dispositions des parties [6] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 attentivement touts les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur position au sujet de la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des positions des parties.\n[7] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal peut ordonner l\u2019instruction commune de plusieurs plaintes lorsqu\u2019elles comportent pour l\u2019essentiel les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaintes comportent des questions de fait et de droit communes : les deux plaintes portent sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien de M. Andrews et de sa fille. Le lien entre ces deux plaintes est clairement indiqu\u00e9 dans le libell\u00e9 de la plainte de 2010 de M. Andrews : [traduction] \u00ab la discrimination dont mon p\u00e8re a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 victime s\u2019est transmise \u00e0 moi et \u00e0 mes filles. \u00bb Comme le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 selon la g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie, le droit de Michelle Andrews d\u00e9coule et d\u00e9pend de celui de son p\u00e8re, M. Andrews. Toutes les questions de fait et de droit qui \u00e9tayent l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de M. Andrew \u00e9tayent n\u00e9cessairement celle de sa fille Michelle.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019une seule instruction \u00e9viterait la possibilit\u00e9 que des d\u00e9cisions incoh\u00e9rentes soient rendues, serait plus efficace et entra\u00eenerait des \u00e9conomies pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour la Commission et pour le Tribunal par rapport \u00e0 la tenue de deux audiences. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit contester la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP dans les deux dossiers et utilisera des preuves semblables \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa d\u00e9fense pour chaque dossier. Les deux dossiers sont \u00e0 des \u00e9tapes semblables de la proc\u00e9dure et le fait que la plainte de 2010 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant au nom de sa fille n\u2019a aucune cons\u00e9quence sur l\u2019instruction commune. Il n\u2019y a rien dans l\u2019instruction commune qui affecterait la capacit\u00e9 de M. Andrews de pr\u00e9senter les preuves et les arguments qu\u2019il souhaite pr\u00e9senter dans ces deux plaintes, et le pr\u00e9judice qui pourrait \u00eatre caus\u00e9 par le d\u00e9lai est mineur et est supplant\u00e9 par les avantages de l\u2019instruction commune. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient d\u2019autre part que le fait d\u2019instruire les plaintes s\u00e9par\u00e9ment entra\u00eenerait la duplication de mat\u00e9riel possiblement volumineux, le t\u00e9moignage en double de certains t\u00e9moins et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, des d\u00e9penses importantes pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Comme l\u2019objectif sous-jacent de l\u2019instruction commune est d\u2019\u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des instances et de promouvoir le r\u00e8glement des plaintes dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais, de fa\u00e7on coh\u00e9rente et \u00e9conomique, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 ces facteurs en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[9] La Commission appuie la requ\u00eate en jonction des deux plaintes parce que cela am\u00e9liorerait l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019instance. Les parties pour les deux plaintes sont les m\u00eames et il n\u2019existe aucun risque que la jonction des dossiers cause un pr\u00e9judice au plaignant en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 entendre des t\u00e9moignages et des observations qui sont uniques \u00e0 un seul des dossiers. Chaque partie aura un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct dans tous les aspects des instances communes. La Commission pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des deux plaintes exigera du Tribunal qu\u2019il tienne compte, entre autres :\n\u2022 de l\u2019histoire de la famille Andrews;\n\u2022 de l\u2019historique et de l\u2019application actuelle des dispositions sur le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit de la Loi sur les Indiens;\n\u2022 de la question de savoir si l\u2019attribution du statut d\u2019Indien inscrit au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens est un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP;\n\u2022 de la question de savoir si les dispositions contest\u00e9es sur l\u2019inscription sont discriminatoires \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue en raison de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation pass\u00e9e du p\u00e8re du plaignant;\n\u2022 de la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut fournir des motifs justifiables au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP;\n\u2022 de la question de savoir quelles mesures de redressement doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es si le Tribunal conclue que les aspects contest\u00e9s de l\u2019inscription sont discriminatoires et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun motif justifiable.\n[10] La Commission reconna\u00eet que la plainte de 2008 soul\u00e8ve une question qui n\u2019est pas express\u00e9ment soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte de 2010, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les r\u00e9percussions de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la seconde g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Cependant, la jonction des plaintes ne requiert par qu\u2019elles soient tout \u00e0 fait identiques. Le fait de joindre les deux plaintes n\u2019emp\u00eachera pas le plaignant de soulever tous les arguments qu\u2019il souhaite soulever en lien avec la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom de sa fille.\n[11] Le plaignant s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes. Selon lui, les deux plaintes sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes et des lois diff\u00e9rentes sont mises en cause. Le seul chevauchement porte sur l\u2019\u00e9mancipation. Le plaignant craint que la question de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation \u00e9clipse la question importante de la contestation de la \u00ab r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la seconde g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00bb du r\u00e9gime d\u2019inscription. Selon le plaignant, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission montre d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de faire de la question de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation une question principale. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il serait injuste envers les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la question de la \u00ab r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la seconde g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00bb du r\u00e9gime d\u2019inscription. Les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations ont droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision claire au sujet des deux questions et ne devraient pas se retrouver avec une d\u00e9cision hybride qui causerait probablement une certaine confusion. La moindre chance qu\u2019il puisse y avoir confusion devrait \u00eatre suffisante pour qu\u2019il ait deux instructions, une pour chaque plainte. Selon le plaignant, la jonction des plaintes n\u2019\u00e9conomiserait pas de temps ni d\u2019argent, parce qu\u2019une autre personne pourrait contester la partie de la Loi sur les Indiens portant sur l\u2019inscription si cette question n\u2019est pas tranch\u00e9e maintenant. \u00c0 ce sujet, le traitement d\u2019une nouvelle plainte constituerait une d\u00e9pense de temps et d\u2019argent suppl\u00e9mentaire pour la Commission.\nIV. Le droit et analyse [12] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 40(4) de la LCDP, c\u2019est la Commission qui a le pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer si des plaintes devraient \u00eatre entendues ensemble lors d\u2019une instruction commune du Tribunal. Cependant, la question de savoir si une seule audience ou plusieurs audiences sont n\u00e9cessaires est une question de proc\u00e9dure (voir Lattey c. Chemin de fer du Pacifique, (25 f\u00e9vrier 2002), d\u00e9cision no 1 (TCDP), au paragraphe 12 (Lattey)). En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique. De plus, le paragraphe 48.9(1) pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Ensemble, ces deux paragraphes pr\u00e9cisent que, tant que les r\u00e8gles de pratique sont justes, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal peut d\u00e9terminer si une seule audience ou plusieurs audiences doivent \u00eatre tenues dans le cas des deux plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[13] Dans Lattey, pour d\u00e9terminer si les plaintes dans cette affaire devaient \u00eatre jointes, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il devait tenir compte d\u2019un certain nombre de facteurs, y compris :\n(1) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 \u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, y compris la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts, des d\u00e9lais, des inconv\u00e9nients pour les t\u00e9moins, du besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve et du risque de parvenir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires;\n(2) Le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer aux intim\u00e9s [en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, au plaignant, qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la jonction] une instruction commune, notamment en raison du prolongement de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience pour chaque intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner des questions propres \u00e0 l\u2019autre intim\u00e9, ainsi que du risque de confusion que pourrait engendrer la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ayant peut-\u00eatre pas rapport aux all\u00e9gations mettant en cause particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre intim\u00e9;\n(3) L\u2019existence de questions de fait ou de droit communes.\n(voir Lattey, au paragraphe 13)\n[14] Compte tenu des circonstances dans les deux plaintes, je conclus que l\u2019instruction commune des deux plaintes de discrimination acc\u00e9l\u00e9rerait la proc\u00e9dure et que cela est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public. Bien qu\u2019il puisse exister diff\u00e9rentes questions de droit dans les deux plaintes, j\u2019accepte que ces questions sont entrem\u00eal\u00e9es et que la preuve \u00e0 ce sujet se chevauchera n\u00e9cessairement. De plus, les deux plaintes ont un fondement factuel semblable. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019instruction commune des deux plaintes donnerait au Tribunal un contexte historique et factuel clair des plaintes, qui formerait le fondement de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal au sujet de chacune des questions de droit et de fait. Un contexte historique et factuel clair des plaintes r\u00e9duira \u00e9galement le risque d\u2019incoh\u00e9rence dans l\u2019analyse des deux plaintes. Aussi, comme les parties aux deux plaintes sont les m\u00eames, il n\u2019y aura aucune confusion dans la pr\u00e9sentation de preuves portant sur une seule des plaintes, au sens du deuxi\u00e8me facteur dans la d\u00e9cision Lattey. En fait, les deux plaintes sont \u00e0 des \u00e9tapes semblables de l\u2019instruction et tout retard d\u00e9coulant de la jonction des audiences peut \u00eatre r\u00e9duit gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une gestion d\u2019instance active.\n[15] Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019instruction commune des deux plaintes causera de la confusion pour les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations en ce qui a trait aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans chaque plainte. Chaque partie aura l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter son dossier quant aux deux plaintes. Bien que\nl\u2019instruction des plaintes sera commune, le Tribunal examinera les questions soulev\u00e9es dans chaque plainte de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9par\u00e9e et fournira des motifs pour sa d\u00e9cision au sujet de chacune des plaintes en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties.\n[16] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate en jonction des deux plaintes pour qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait qu\u2019une seule instruction est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 8 d\u00e9cembre 2011\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1725\/8011\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Roger William Andrews c.

Introduction [1] Dans le dossier T1311\/4108, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a tenu une audience les 1er et 2 juin 2009 et a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 27 juillet 2009 : Detra Berberi c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2009 TCDP 21 (Berberi). La plaignante demande maintenant au Tribunal de tenir une audience au sujet de l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e pendant l\u2019audience de juin 2009. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u les avantages de cette offre de r\u00e9paration.\nII. Le contexte [2] Dans Berberi, la plaignante soutenait qu\u2019on lui avait refus\u00e9 un poste de CR-04 \u00e0 la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC) en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et de son taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme dans le pass\u00e9, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L. R. C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi). La GRC a reconnu que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas employer la plaignante \u00e9tait en partie fond\u00e9e sur la perception d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019audition de la plainte ne portait que sur la question des mesures de redressement qu\u2019il convenait d\u2019accorder. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la GRC a offert \u00e0 la plaignante un poste de CR-04, qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9. Le Tribunal a fait la remarque suivante dans sa d\u00e9cision :\n[32] Lors de l\u2019audience, la GRC a offert \u00e0 Mme Berberi un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de commis aux finances\/\u00e0 l\u2019administration (CR-04) au d\u00e9tachement de la GRC de Milton, qui comptait parmi les lieux de travail qu\u2019elle privil\u00e9giait. La seule condition \u00e9tait que Mme Berberi obtienne une cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00ab tr\u00e8s secret \u00bb. La GRC a \u00e9galement propos\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une \u00e9valuation de la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle de Mme Berberi et de faire les adaptations n\u00e9cessaires afin qu\u2019elle puisse remplir ses fonctions avec succ\u00e8s.\n[33] Mme Berberi a accept\u00e9 cette offre et a convenu que cela correspondait \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9e, soit un poste permanent \u00e0 la GRC. Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inutile que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance.\n[3] Aucune mesure de redressement n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante pour perte de salaire, pour acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 et pour ses autres d\u00e9penses, mais des mesures de redressement lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pour ses frais juridiques.\n[4] Mme Berberi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Entre autres, elle soutenait que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en supposant que la GRC agirait de bonne foi et honorerait l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi. Dans Berberi c. Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (GRC), 2011 CF 485, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[63] \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question se trouve dans la reconnaissance du Tribunal, au paragraphe 33 de la d\u00e9cision, que les \u00ab parties ont convenu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inutile que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance \u00bb en ce qui concernait l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi faite par la GRC, laquelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la demanderesse.\n[64] La demanderesse \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat lors de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal. Elle avait le choix de pr\u00e9senter une demande pour obtenir une ordonnance. Elle ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[65] Le Tribunal s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de ses responsabilit\u00e9s d\u00e8s qu\u2019il a statu\u00e9 sur les questions de l\u2019indemnisation, y compris pour le pr\u00e9judice moral et pour les frais juridiques. La demanderesse pouvait solliciter une ordonnance du Tribunal en ce qui concernait la mise en \u0153uvre de ces r\u00e9parations. Elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 montrer que le Tribunal avait fait des suppositions erron\u00e9es, et cet argument est rejet\u00e9.\n[5] La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de Mme Berberi a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e et elle a interjet\u00e9 appel de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[6] Le 15 juillet 2011, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la demande en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au Tribunal. Les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de la demande et on leur a offert de la m\u00e9diation afin de r\u00e9gler le conflit. Cependant, les parties ont refus\u00e9 la m\u00e9diation.\nIII. Les positions des parties [7] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration, une fois accept\u00e9e, faisait partie de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Elle soutient, pour le respect de la justice naturelle et de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 judiciaire et institutionnelle du Tribunal, qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire et conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la Loi que le Tribunal poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence pour superviser le comportement des parties en ce qui a trait aux offres r\u00e9paratrices pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et accept\u00e9es au cours de la proc\u00e9dure dont il \u00e9tait saisi.\n[8] Subsidiairement, la plaignante soutient que l\u2019audition de sa plainte devrait reprendre parce que la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement ou compl\u00e8tement tranch\u00e9e. Selon la plaignante, la r\u00e9ticence de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de satisfaire aux modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration frappe de nullit\u00e9 l\u2019acceptation de Mme Berberi \u00e0 l\u2019audience de ne pas poursuivre une ordonnance en obtention d\u2019un poste permanent \u00e0 la GRC. Subsidiairement encore, la plaignante soutient que la pr\u00e9sente demande devrait compter comme une nouvelle demande dans laquelle elle soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 poursuit la conduite discriminatoire qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu avoir adopt\u00e9e.\n[9] Tant l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) soutiennent que le Tribunal est functus officio en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte. Le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance ou une d\u00e9cision finale et, par cons\u00e9quent, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de traiter de la question est \u00e9puis\u00e9e. Cependant, tant l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la Commission reconnaissent que l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration faisait partie de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nIV. Le droit [10] En vertu du principe de droit de functus officio, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux ne peuvent revenir sur une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive, sauf lorsqu\u2019il y a eu un lapsus lors de sa r\u00e9daction, ou lorsqu\u2019il y a eu une erreur dans l\u2019expression de l\u2019intention manifeste du tribunal (voir Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 848, au paragraphe 19 (Chandler)). Dans Chandler, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le principe de droit de functus officio s\u2019applique aussi aux tribunaux administratifs, bien que \u00ab [\u2026] son application doit \u00eatre plus souple et moins formaliste [\u2026] \u00bb (Chandler, au paragraphe 21). Ainsi, il est possible qu\u2019un tribunal revienne sur une d\u00e9cision si sa loi habilitante porte \u00e0 croire que cela lui permettra d\u2019exercer les fonctions que ladite loi lui conf\u00e8re (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 22). En outre, le tribunal peut rouvrir sa d\u00e9cision s\u2019il a omis de trancher une question qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit dans la proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a le pouvoir de trancher en vertu de sa loi habilitante (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 23). Cependant, le tribunal ne peut revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision simplement parce qu\u2019il a chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis, parce qu\u2019il a commis une erreur dans le cadre de sa comp\u00e9tence, ou parce que les circonstances ont chang\u00e9 (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 20). De plus, le fait qu\u2019une mesure de redressement est pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre mesure de redressement ne permet pas au Tribunal de rouvrir la proc\u00e9dure afin de changer de choix (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 23).\n[11] Dans Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherche) (1994), 80 F. T. R. 256 (C.F.) (Grover), une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider si le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de rester saisi quant \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de redressement. Le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 que le plaignant soit nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste pr\u00e9cis, mais \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 saisi en attente d\u2019autres preuves au sujet de l\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que la Loi ne contienne aucune disposition autorisant express\u00e9ment le Tribunal \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions, le fait qu\u2019elle investisse le Tribunal de larges pouvoirs, ajout\u00e9 au fait qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re large de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner pleinement effet aux droits qu\u2019elle prot\u00e8ge, permet au Tribunal de rester saisi de l\u2019affaire sur certains points afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que les plaignants jouissent effectivement de la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il leur a accord\u00e9e (voir Grover, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 36). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 :\nDe toute \u00e9vidence, la Loi prescrit que la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e soit efficace et, en cons\u00e9quence, il faut dans certains cas que le tribunal soit habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce que ses ordonnances r\u00e9paratrices soient vraiment ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, les pouvoirs en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9paration que lui conf\u00e8re le par. 53(2) doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme incluant le pouvoir de r\u00e9server sa comp\u00e9tence sur certains points afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que les plaignants jouissent effectivement de la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il leur a accord\u00e9e. Lui refuser ce pouvoir participerait d\u2019un formalisme excessif et irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du but de la l\u00e9gislation qui est fondamentalement r\u00e9paratrice. Dans le contexte d\u2019une ordonnance r\u00e9paratrice assez complexe, il est logique que le tribunal demeure comp\u00e9tent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de r\u00e9paration afin de faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son ordonnance. Cette solution est conforme au but g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la l\u00e9gislation et va dans le sens de l\u2019application souple que pr\u00e9conise le juge Sopinka dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Ce serait contrecarrer l\u2019objectif de la l\u00e9gislation que d\u2019obliger le plaignant \u00e0 demander l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance non ambigu\u00eb devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte pour obtenir la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal. (Grover, au paragraphe 33)\n[12] De fa\u00e7on semblable, dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Moore, [1998] 4 C.F. 585 (Moore), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider si le Tribunal avait outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence en r\u00e9examinant et en changeant une ordonnance de cessation et abstention. Ayant conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, le Tribunal a rendu une directive g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans son ordonnance et a donn\u00e9 aux parties l\u2019occasion de s\u2019entendre sur les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019ordonnance alors que le Tribunal restait saisi de l\u2019affaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le raisonnement dans l\u2019affaire Grover et dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLe raisonnement suivi dans ces affaires appuie la conclusion que le tribunal jouit d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour rouvrir une affaire et je conclus que c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La question de savoir si ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est exerc\u00e9 convenablement par le tribunal d\u00e9pendra des faits de chaque instance. Cela est compatible avec le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par le demandeur et qui portait sur la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un organisme autre que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. (Moore, au paragraphe 49)\n[13] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le Tribunal \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 saisi et que rien ne donnait \u00e0 penser que le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait finale et ex\u00e9cutoire d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de revenir sur une question comprise dans l\u2019ordonnance. Par cons\u00e9quent, sur le fondement de l\u2019affaire Grover, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi permettait au Tribunal de rouvrir sa proc\u00e9dure (voir Moore, au paragraphe 50).\n[14] La jurisprudence du Tribunal qui a examin\u00e9 le principe de droit de functus officio et qui a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Grover et l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement conclu que, si le Tribunal n\u2019est pas rest\u00e9 saisi d\u2019une question, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal est finale, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une exception au principe de droit de functus officio puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tabli (voir Douglas c. SLH Transport Inc., 2010 TCDP 25; Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social), 2010 TCDP 19; Warman c. Beaumont, 2009 TCDP 32; et Goyette c. Voyageur colonial Lt\u00e9e, (16 novembre 2001), 1\u00e8re inst. 14\/01 (TCDP)). Cependant, la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, rendue plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Grover et l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore et qui examinait le pouvoir de la Commission de r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions, offre un meilleur guide sur l\u2019application du principe de droit de functus officio aux tribunaux administratifs et aux commissions.\n[15] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kleysen Transport Ltd c. Hunter, 2004 CF 1413 (Kleysen), la Commission avait enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur une plainte et l\u2019enqu\u00eateur avait recommand\u00e9 que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, la Commission n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de certaines des observations du plaignant. La Commission a donc r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la plainte et l\u2019a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire des actions de la Commission. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que rien dans la Loi ne donnait \u00e0 la Commission le pouvoir de r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions. Cependant, \u00ab la Commission est manifestement investie d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire consid\u00e9rable pour ce qui concerne l\u2019examen pr\u00e9liminaire et le traitement des plaintes \u00bb (voir Kleysen, au paragraphe 8). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a aussi examin\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Zutter c. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (1995), 122 D.L.R. (4th) 665 (B.C.C.A.) (Zutter). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Zutter, le British Columbia Council of Human Rights avait aussi omis de tenir compte d\u2019observations d\u2019un plaignant et la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait conclu que le conseil avait le pouvoir de r\u00e9examiner la plainte vu les circonstances. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans Zutter, en plus d\u2019examiner la loi habilitante du conseil, a aussi tenu compte du contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la situation et a conclu que l\u2019absence de droit de porter en appel la d\u00e9cision du conseil et le fait que le conseil tentait de corriger une injustice \u00e9taient des facteurs contextuels qui appuyaient le pouvoir du conseil de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a aussi examin\u00e9 dans Zutter l\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab ce serait une malheureuse ironie si le conseil, dont l\u2019existence m\u00eame et le mandat de redressement sont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par les valeurs fondamentales d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de justice, n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9parer une injustice \u00bb (Zutter, au paragraphe 23). Dans la d\u00e9cision Kleysen, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, examinant les arr\u00eats Zutter et Chandler, a conclu :\n[16] Dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019elle avait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de prendre en consid\u00e9ration certaines des observations de M. Hunter. Si elle ne l\u2019avait pas fait, M. Hunter aurait fort bien pu former une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire au motif que la Commission l\u2019aurait trait\u00e9 injustement en omettant de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la totalit\u00e9 de ses observations. \u00c0 mon avis, la Commission a eu raison de d\u00e9cider d\u2019examiner le point de savoir si sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des nouvelles observations, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019imposer \u00e0 M. Hunter la charge de former une demande devant notre Cour. (Kleysen, au paragraphe 12)\n[17] Dans la d\u00e9cision Merham c. Banque royale du Canada, 2009 CF 1127 (Mehram), le plaignant avait demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission. La Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente apr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux renseignements, parce que les renseignements ne d\u00e9montraient pas de lien avec un motif de distinction illicite. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9tait raisonnable et elle a confirm\u00e9 que la Commission avait le pouvoir de r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions. En particulier, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Kleysen et les arr\u00eats Zutter et Chandler, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de la jurisprudence pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, je conclus que la Commission a le pouvoir de r\u00e9examiner ses propres d\u00e9cisions, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on restreinte dans des circonstances exceptionnelles. (Merham, au paragraphe 25)\nV. Analyse [18] L\u2019application du principe de droit de functus officio aux tribunaux administratifs doit \u00eatre souple et ne doit pas \u00eatre trop formaliste (voir Chandler, au paragraphe 21). Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover, lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si le Tribunal pouvait superviser l\u2019application de ses ordonnances de redressement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu que le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de rester saisi de ses ordonnances de redressement afin de garantir qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient bel et bien appliqu\u00e9es. Dans la d\u00e9cision Moore, pour d\u00e9cider si le Tribunal pouvait r\u00e9examiner et changer une ordonnance de redressement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le raisonnement de la d\u00e9cision Grover et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab le tribunal jouit d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire important de rouvrir une affaire [\u2026] \u00bb (Moore, au paragraphe 49). Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chandler, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]a question de savoir si ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est exerc\u00e9 convenablement par le tribunal d\u00e9pendra des faits de chaque instance \u00bb (Moore, au paragraphe 49). Dans les d\u00e9cisions Grover et Moore, bien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait tenu compte du fait que le Tribunal \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 saisi de l\u2019affaire lorsqu\u2019elle a tranch\u00e9 la question de savoir si le Tribunal avait exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e pour rouvrir une affaire, finalement, il ne s\u2019agissait pas du seul facteur dont la Cour a tenu compte. En plus d\u2019examiner le contexte de chaque affaire, le Tribunal doit aussi examiner si \u00ab la loi habilitante porte \u00e0 croire qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre rouverte afin de permettre au Tribunal d\u2019exercer la fonction que lui conf\u00e8re sa loi habilitante \u00bb (Chandler, au paragraphe 22). Cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyser le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal de rouvrir une affaire est conforme au raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les d\u00e9cisions Kleysen et Merham. La question devient alors : compte tenu de la Loi et des circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal devrait-il rouvrir l\u2019affaire afin d\u2019exercer la fonction que lui conf\u00e8re la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne?\n[19] Le principal objectif de la Loi est de \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9celer les actes discriminatoires et [\u2026] les supprimer \u00bb (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13). \u00c0 ce sujet, le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi accorde au Tribunal un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement afin d\u2019\u00e9liminer la discrimination lorsqu\u2019une plainte de discrimination est justifi\u00e9e (voir Grover, au paragraphe 31). Par cons\u00e9quent, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00ab il faut donc interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 53(2) de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faciliter l\u2019indemnisation des victimes d\u2019actes discriminatoires \u00bb (Grover, au paragraphe 32). La Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas un droit d\u2019appel des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal, et le contr\u00f4le judiciaire n\u2019est pas le forum appropri\u00e9 pour demander l\u2019application d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante : \u00ab la demanderesse pouvait solliciter une ordonnance du Tribunal en ce qui concernait la mise en \u0153uvre de ces r\u00e9parations \u00bb. (Berberi c. Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (GRC), 2011 CF 485, au paragraphe 65). Lorsque le Tribunal rend une ordonnance de redressement en application du paragraphe 53(2), cette ordonnance peut devenir une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin d\u2019\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9, au sens de l\u2019article 57 de la Loi. L\u2019article 57 permet aux d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab [\u2026] ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es \u00e0 elles seules par l\u2019entremise de proc\u00e9dures d\u2019outrage parce que, comme pour les d\u00e9cisions des cours sup\u00e9rieures, le l\u00e9gislateur estime qu\u2019elles m\u00e9ritent le respect que les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019outrage sont cens\u00e9es assurer \u00bb (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Warman, 2011 CAF 297, au paragraphe 44). Cependant, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab ce serait contrecarrer l\u2019objectif de la l\u00e9gislation que d\u2019obliger le plaignant \u00e0 demander l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance non ambigu\u00eb devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte pour obtenir la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00bb (Grover, au paragraphe 33). Gardant ce cadre l\u00e9gal en t\u00eate, je me pencherai maintenant sur la situation pr\u00e9cise pour laquelle la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rouvrir sa plainte.\n[20] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante ne conteste pas la finalit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. La validit\u00e9 ou la justesse de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal n\u2019est pas en question, et la plaignante ne demande pas au Tribunal de changer les mesures de redressement qui sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans sa d\u00e9cision. Elle demande plut\u00f4t au Tribunal l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9clamer l\u2019application efficace d\u2019une offre de r\u00e9paration, qui, selon toutes les parties, faisait partie de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En ce sens, l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une entente priv\u00e9e entre les parties. Comme la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance de redressement au sens du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, mais les parties ont convenu qu\u2019une telle ordonnance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire (voir Berberi, au paragraphe 33). Cela dit, ne serait-il pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment formaliste de refuser \u00e0 une victime de discrimination l\u2019occasion de demander l\u2019application efficace d\u2019une mesure de redressement pour la seule raison que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas fait de cette mesure de redressement une \u00ab ordonnance \u00bb? Bien que le Tribunal ait laiss\u00e9 le soin aux parties d\u2019appliquer la mesure de redressement, il s\u2019attendait sans doute \u00e0 ce que la mesure de redressement soit appliqu\u00e9e rapidement pour la plaignante. De plus, le Tribunal a trait\u00e9 de la question de la mesure de redressement dans ses motifs et a \u00e9tabli les conditions de cette mesure (voir Berberi, au paragraphe 32). Cependant, sans une ordonnance du Tribunal, la plaignante se retrouve sans m\u00e9canismes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution au sujet de l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration. Comme les pouvoirs de redressement du Tribunal devraient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00ab [\u2026] faciliter l\u2019indemnisation des victimes d\u2019actes discriminatoires \u00bb (Grover, au paragraphe 32) et comme la Loi \u00ab [\u2026] prescrit que la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e soit efficace [\u2026] \u00bb (Grover, au paragraphe 33), il serait contraire au mandat de redressement de la Loi de refuser \u00e0 la victime de discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019occasion de rouvrir sa plainte afin de demander l\u2019application efficace de l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration. De fa\u00e7on semblable au raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Zutter, il serait malheureusement ironique que le Tribunal, dont l\u2019existence m\u00eame et l\u2019objectif de redressement sont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par les valeurs fondamentales de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la justice, n\u2019ait tout de m\u00eame pas le pouvoir de r\u00e9parer une possible injustice (voir Zutter, au paragraphe 23). Par cons\u00e9quent, vu les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il a comp\u00e9tence pour rouvrir l\u2019affaire afin de traiter des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019offre de r\u00e9paration. Le Tribunal organisera une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance entre les parties pour d\u00e9terminer de quelle fa\u00e7on il proc\u00e9dera.\nSign\u00e9e par\nShirish P.

Introduction [1] Le plaignant, Paul Marchand, est un ancien membre des Forces canadiennes (les FC). En 2007, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale (le MDN), pour l\u2019un des quelques postes \u00e0 temps plein dot\u00e9s soit pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, soit pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de nettoyeurs \u00e0 la base des Forces canadiennes de Shilo (Manitoba) (la BFC Shilo). Plusieurs femmes ont finalement obtenu les postes et il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9. M. Marchand soutient que le MDN a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019employer parce qu\u2019il est un homme. Il soutient qu\u2019en agissant ainsi, le MDN a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] Dans la d\u00e9cision qui suit, je conclus que, si je m\u2019en tiens exclusivement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des faits par M. Marchand au sujet des nominations, il a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie selon laquelle le d\u00e9faut du MDN de l\u2019embaucher \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de toute la preuve au sujet des nominations, je conclus que le MDN a fourni une explication raisonnable qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte. En particulier, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les nominations temporaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites apr\u00e8s que M. Marchand eut \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection en raison de son d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9montrer dans sa demande qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les qualifications essentielles pour les postes. En ce qui a trait au poste permanent, la preuve d\u00e9montre que la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e9tait la meilleure candidate (ou la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb) pour le poste. Le sexe de M. Marchand n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas le nommer pour ce poste.\nII. La preuve de M. Marchand [3] M. Marchand n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pour la partie plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nA. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail de M. Marchand [4] M. Marchand s\u2019est enr\u00f4l\u00e9 dans les FC en 1981 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9 \u00e0 la BFC Shilo pendant la majorit\u00e9 de sa carri\u00e8re. Il aimait sa carri\u00e8re militaire, mais il a malheureusement d\u00fb prendre sa retraite en 1990 en raison d\u2019un accident de travail. \u00c0 ce moment, il se consid\u00e9rait chez lui \u00e0 Shilo et il s\u2019est cherch\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 la base apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part des FC.\n[5] D\u00e8s qu\u2019il a pris sa retraite, il a travaill\u00e9 comme nettoyeur \u00e0 la base pendant environ cinq ans en tout, soit de fa\u00e7on occasionnelle, soit pendant la dur\u00e9e d\u2019un certain nombre de contrats. Son employeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9tait le Centre d\u2019entra\u00eenement de l\u2019arm\u00e9e allemande (Shilo) (GATES), un centre qui \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019arm\u00e9e allemande qui utilisait les \u00e9tablissements du MDN \u00e0 Shilo. Pendant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, M. Marchand avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 plusieurs postes permanents au sein du MDN \u00e0 la BFC Shilo, mais il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9. Il croit qu\u2019il y a eu du favoritisme dans ces processus de nomination et il a finalement cess\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour travailler \u00e0 cette base.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la base militaire, M. Marchand a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler ailleurs dans la r\u00e9gion de Shilo et de Brandon, o\u00f9 il a occup\u00e9 divers emplois. Vers 2005, cependant, il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein comme nettoyeur \u00e0 la BFC Shilo. Il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 par une compagnie de nettoyage qui avait des contrats avec le MDN. La compagnie appartenait \u00e0 Cindy Brown, qui \u00e9tait aussi une employ\u00e9e du MDN \u00e0 titre de chef des installations de la base \u00e0 la BFC Shilo. C\u2019est Mme Brown qui a si\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert technique et de gestionnaire au comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui a effectu\u00e9 les nominations contest\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[7] Lorsqu\u2019une autre compagnie de nettoyage a repris le contrat de nettoyage en 2006, la compagnie a embauch\u00e9 M. Marchand. En date de l\u2019audience, M. Marchand travaillait toujours pour cette compagnie \u00e0 titre de superviseur des activit\u00e9s de nettoyage \u00e0 la BFC Shilo.\nB. La demande d\u2019emploi de M. Marchand [8] En mars 2007, M. Marchand a vu une annonce sur un tableau d\u2019affichage \u00e0 la BFC Shilo pour trois postes de nettoyeurs \u00e0 temps plein dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour le MDN, qui portaient la classification GS\u2011BUS\u201102. L\u2019annonce pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019une personne qui habitait ou qui \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 Shilo (Manitoba) ou dans un rayon de 100 km de la ville, pouvait pr\u00e9senter sa candidature. Le processus \u00e9tait donc externe et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas limit\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s travaillant d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour le MDN.\n[9] Selon l\u2019annonce, les personnes qui souhaitaient pr\u00e9senter leur candidature devaient le faire de fa\u00e7on informatis\u00e9e en ligne. Les candidatures pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sur papier, par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur ou par courrier, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas accept\u00e9es. M. Marchand a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature en utilisant un ordinateur auquel il a eu acc\u00e8s sur la base. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de remplir correctement la demande d\u2019emploi parce qu\u2019il ne savait pas utiliser un ordinateur. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la saisie de renseignements \u00e9tait si compliqu\u00e9e que m\u00eame les personnes qui savaient utiliser un ordinateur avaient eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir le formulaire en ligne. Il croit que seulement certaines parties de sa demande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises.\n[10] Les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines du MDN ont utilis\u00e9 un tableau g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 partir des renseignements fournis en ligne par les candidats pour d\u00e9terminer quels candidats seraient retenus \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. M. Marchand a not\u00e9 que le tableau montre au sujet de sa demande qu\u2019il ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le nettoyage commercial et dans l\u2019utilisation de divers \u00e9quipements de nettoyage commercial. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cette information \u00e9tait clairement fausse, parce qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature, il avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la base comme nettoyeur, tant comme employ\u00e9 occasionnel que comme employ\u00e9 d\u2019un entrepreneur, pendant presque deux d\u00e9cennies. M. Marchand a soutenu que cette erreur est une preuve du fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de remplir sa demande correctement en ligne.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s avoir rempli sa demande, comme il se doutait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te, M. Marchand s\u2019est rendu au bureau des ressources humaines du MDN pour tenter de pr\u00e9senter une copie papier de son curriculum vitae. Il a rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019agente des ressources humaines Shannon Barnes\u2011Girouard, qui l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas le faire. Il pouvait seulement pr\u00e9senter son curriculum vitae en ligne.\n[12] M. Marchand a \u00e9t\u00e9 si boulevers\u00e9 par la r\u00e9ponse du MDN qu\u2019il s\u2019est plaint de cette politique \u00e0 son d\u00e9put\u00e9. Plusieurs jours plus tard, Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Marchand pour lui expliquer que le syst\u00e8me informatique \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux et que le MDN acceptait maintenant son curriculum vitae sur papier. M. Marchand croit que le MDN a chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis en raison d\u2019une intervention de son d\u00e9put\u00e9.\n[13] M. Marchand a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son curriculum vitae sur papier. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par Mme Brown, Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard et une troisi\u00e8me personne, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas employ\u00e9e par le MDN, mais plut\u00f4t par le Programme de soutien du personnel des Forces canadiennes. M. Marchand a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 plusieurs questions au sujet du nettoyage commercial. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019entrevue s\u2019\u00e9tait bien pass\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce qu\u2019il sache, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul candidat dont l\u2019entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par trois personnes plut\u00f4t que deux. Il se demande pourquoi il a ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment.\n[14] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, M. Marchand a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par certains des nettoyeurs au travail qu\u2019une femme (Dawn Cyr) avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste permanent de nettoyeur avant m\u00eame qu\u2019il subisse son entrevue. Il soutient qu\u2019il a toujours soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 que Mme Cyr serait embauch\u00e9e. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il a su qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e, il s\u2019est rendu au bureau des ressources humaines et a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de l\u2019issue du processus. La preuve montre que cette rencontre a eu lieu le 29 ao\u00fbt 2007. Une adjointe aux ressources humaines, Rebecca Moorehead, l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que, bien que l\u2019employeur ne f\u00fbt pas oblig\u00e9 de l\u2019aviser personnellement de la nomination de Mme Cyr, une lettre au sujet du processus de nomination lui avait en effet \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courrier plus de deux mois plus t\u00f4t, le 6 juin 2007.\n[15] Plusieurs jours apr\u00e8s la rencontre, il a re\u00e7u une copie de cette lettre, qui l\u2019avisait qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 dans le processus de s\u00e9lection, que son nom avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s et qu\u2019on pourrait communiquer avec lui ult\u00e9rieurement si d\u2019autres postes devenaient vacants. La lettre \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation sign\u00e9e par Mme Moorehead et dat\u00e9e du 29 ao\u00fbt 2007, dans laquelle elle expliquait que son bureau avait, par erreur, interverti les chiffres de la case postale de M. Marchand lorsqu\u2019elle avait envoy\u00e9 la lettre du 6 juin. Cependant, la lettre n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au MDN et, par cons\u00e9quent, personne ne savait qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7ue. Les deux lettres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve et M. Marchand a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019adresse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal \u00e9crite sur la lettre du 6 juin.\n[16] M. Marchand a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il f\u00eet partie d\u2019un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, on n\u2019avait jamais communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour doter un poste. Cependant, il sait que deux femmes (Amanda Pero et Vicki Carriere) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies dans le bassin pour travailler de temps \u00e0 autre de fa\u00e7on temporaire. Il se demande pourquoi Mme Carriere a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas de permis de conduire, ce qui \u00e0 son avis \u00e9tait une qualification essentielle pour le poste de nettoyeur \u00e0 la base.\n[17] \u00c0 sa connaissance, neuf des dix nettoyeurs employ\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on permanente au MDN sont des femmes, et le seul homme prendra sa retraite bient\u00f4t. Les seuls autres hommes que M. Marchand a vus au cours des ann\u00e9es travaillaient pour GATES, pas pour le MDN. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, depuis que Mme Brown a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les services de nettoyage pour le MDN \u00e0 la BFC Shilo, seules des femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on permanente. Il a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il ne savait pas combien d\u2019hommes, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature lors du processus de nomination de 2007 auquel il avait particip\u00e9, mais il soutient que les hommes, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ne se donnent pas la peine de pr\u00e9senter une demande parce qu\u2019ils savent que Mme Brown ne les embauchera pas.\nIII. Analyse A. Quel est l'\u00e9tat du droit concernant la plainte de discrimination de M. Marchand? [18] Constitue un acte discriminatoire, aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), le fait de refuser d\u2019employer un individu en raison de son sexe (article 3 et alin\u00e9a 7a)). La partie plaignante doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie (qui signifie litt\u00e9ralement \u00ab \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00bb) de discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons\u2011Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une preuve prima facie doit appuyer les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et, si on ajoute foi \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, la preuve doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier qu\u2019un jugement soit rendu en faveur du plaignant en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Une fois la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie, il appartient alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations ou de fournir des explications raisonnables.\n[19] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit l\u2019un des facteurs qui aient compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur (Holden c. Compagnie nationale de chemins de fer (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (C.F. 1re inst.)).\n[20] Dans Basi c. Compagnie de chemins de fer du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, \u00e0 la ligne 38481 (TCDP), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la discrimination n\u2019est pas une pratique que l\u2019on s\u2019attend \u00e0 voir ouvertement. Tout tribunal devrait donc tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il se d\u00e9gage de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\n[21] Les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions illustrent le type de preuve qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination en fonction des circonstances de l'affaire. Dans le cas de plaintes o\u00f9 le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'employeur a refus\u00e9 de lui donner un emploi, la Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario a conclu, dans Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, \u00e0 la ligne 8918, qu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 :\n\u2022 que le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour remplir le poste particulier ;\n\u2022 que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 ;\n\u2022 qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique de distinction, qui est \u00e0 la base de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, a obtenu le poste.\nB. M. Marchand a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie selon laquelle le MDN a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP en refusant de l\u2019employer ? [22] Je suis convaincu que M. Marchand a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que le refus du MDN de l\u2019employer comme nettoyeur dans le cadre des processus de nomination tenus en 2007 constituait une pratique discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP. La preuve qu'il a produite \u00e0 l'appui de ses all\u00e9gations, si on y ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour qu'un jugement soit rendu en sa faveur en l'absence de r\u00e9ponse du MDN.\n[23] Comme le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste au MDN, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, il est appropri\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer le crit\u00e8re Shakes \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En ce qui a trait au premier volet du crit\u00e8re, il existe une preuve convaincante au sujet du fait que M. Marchand est qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de nettoyeur. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 comme nettoyeur dans les installations de la BFC Shilo pendant au moins 15 ans. De plus, le MDN m\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 dans sa lettre \u00e0 M. Marchand qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 dans le processus de nomination et que son nom avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir duquel on pourrait communiquer avec lui ult\u00e9rieurement si un poste devenait vacant. Dans ses observations finales, le MDN n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 que M. Marchand \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9. Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que M. Marchand \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de nettoyeur.\n[24] En ce qui a trait au deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Shakes, M. Marchand a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le MDN ne l\u2019avait pas choisi pour occuper un des postes \u00e0 temps plein pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour lesquels il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature.\n[25] En ce qui a trait au troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Shakes, selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Marchand, la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour le poste permanent (Mme Cyr) et les autres personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es pour les postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sont des femmes. En effet, selon M. Marchand, au cours des 20 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es au moins, le MDN n\u2019a embauch\u00e9 que des femmes pour occuper des postes permanents \u00e0 temps plein de nettoyeur \u00e0 la BFC Shilo, de sorte que neuf des dix nettoyeurs employ\u00e9s dans ces postes sont des femmes.\n[26] Cependant, M. Marchand doit aussi \u00e9tablir que les femmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es dans le processus auquel il a particip\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas plus qualifi\u00e9es que lui. Les annonces des postes comprenaient un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels auxquels les candidats devaient satisfaire afin de se qualifier pour le poste. Le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation a conclu que M. Marchand satisfaisait \u00e0 ces exigences, et son nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment avec celui de Mme Cyr et ceux des autres femmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait au moins aussi qualifi\u00e9 que ces femmes ou, pour paraphraser la d\u00e9cision Shakes, les femmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient pas plus qualifi\u00e9es que lui. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait au troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re.\n[27] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Marchand est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision en sa faveur en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nC. Le MDN a-t-il fourni une explication raisonnable justifiant sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher M. Marchand ? [28] Le MDN reconna\u00eet que M. Marchand s\u2019est qualifi\u00e9 dans le bassin pour les postes de nettoyeurs \u00e0 la BFC Shilo, et qu\u2019il est toujours qualifi\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9. Il reconna\u00eet aussi que les femmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019issue des processus de nomination auxquels M. Marchand a particip\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas plus qualifi\u00e9es que lui. Cependant, le MDN soutient que le sexe de M. Marchand n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui offrir d\u2019emploi. Le MDN soutient plut\u00f4t que ces femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es parce que chacune \u00e9tait la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb pour le minist\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, suivant les r\u00e8gles de dotation applicables dans la fonction publique.\n[29] Le paragraphe 30(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.C., 2003, ch. 22, ss. 12, 13 (la LEFP), pr\u00e9voit que les nominations \u2013 internes ou externes \u2013 \u00e0 la fonction publique faites par la Commission sont fond\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite et sont ind\u00e9pendantes de toute influence politique. Comme le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision Tibbs c. Sous\u2011ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale, 2006 TDFP 8, au paragraphe 63, la LEFP donne aux gestionnaires un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de choisir, pour la nomination, la personne qui non seulement satisfait aux qualifications essentielles du poste, mais qui est la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb en raison des qualifications qui constituent un atout, des besoins actuels ou \u00e0 venir et des exigences op\u00e9rationnelles (voir aussi Visca c. Sous\u2011ministre de la Justice, 2007 TDFP 24, au paragraphe 42).\n[30] Le MDN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve de nombreux documents au sujet des nominations contest\u00e9es et a appel\u00e9 plusieurs t\u00e9moins qui ont particip\u00e9 aux processus de dotation. M. Marchand n\u2019\u00e9tait probablement pas au courant de cette preuve et des subtilit\u00e9s de la dotation de la fonction publique lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Cependant, la preuve soutient l\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas embauch\u00e9 M. Marchand et elle montre que l\u2019explication est raisonnable et ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9texte.\n(i) Le premier processus de dotation \u2013 les postes \u00e0 temps plein dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e [31] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2007, Mme Brown a estim\u00e9 que plusieurs nettoyeurs suppl\u00e9mentaires devaient \u00eatre embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 la base pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard, l\u2019agente des ressources humaines, et elle ont lanc\u00e9 un processus de dotation \u00e0 la suite duquel l\u2019annonce d\u2019emploi que M. Marchand a vue sur le tableau d\u2019affichage a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e. Le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de Mme Brown et de Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard. Mme Brown a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sultat pr\u00e9vu du processus \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir duquel des postes pourraient \u00eatre dot\u00e9s.\n[32] L\u2019annonce pr\u00e9cisait que trois postes vacants \u00e0 temps plein d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e devaient \u00eatre dot\u00e9s. Les candidats devaient pr\u00e9senter leur candidature au plus tard le 6 mars 2007. L\u2019annonce a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e deux semaines plus tard et l\u2019exigence de poss\u00e9der un permis de conduire de classe 5 \u00e0 titre de qualification essentielle pour le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, les candidats avaient d\u00e9sormais jusqu\u2019au 19 mars 2007 pour pr\u00e9senter leur candidature. Toute personne qui avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re annonce \u00e9tait automatiquement incluse dans le processus modifi\u00e9.\n[33] Un total de 45 demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues, 32 femmes et 13 hommes. Quatorze de ces candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection du processus (12 femmes et deux hommes). Le 27 et le 28 mars 2007, le comit\u00e9 a re\u00e7u ces candidats en entrevue. Avec l\u2019aide du personnel des ressources humaines, Mme Brown avait \u00e9labor\u00e9 les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les candidats. Apr\u00e8s les entrevues, le comit\u00e9 a consult\u00e9 et a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences des candidats.\n[34] En l\u2019espace d\u2019une semaine, le comit\u00e9 a termin\u00e9 son \u00e9valuation des candidats et, le 4 avril 2007, il a envoy\u00e9 des lettres \u00e0 11 des candidats retenus (neuf femmes et deux hommes), y compris Mme Cyr, Mme Pero et Mme Carriere, les avisant qu\u2019ils satisfaisaient aux qualifications essentielles pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es pour le processus de s\u00e9lection et que leurs noms avaient, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s dans le bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s. Ils ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s qu\u2019on pourrait communiquer avec eux s\u2019il y avait des postes \u00e0 doter.\n[35] Le 12 avril 2007, Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Cyr pour lui offrir le premier des postes que le comit\u00e9 dotait dans le cadre du processus de dotation, pour une p\u00e9riode se terminant le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2008. Les notes d\u2019entrevue du comit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. Les \u00e9valuations de Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard et de Mme Brown au sujet des r\u00e9ponses de Mme Cyr pendant l\u2019entrevue se situaient entre tr\u00e8s bon et excellent (les deux classements les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s). Mme Brown a produit les notes des v\u00e9rifications de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui ont suivi l\u2019entrevue et qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9es au sujet de Mme Cyr. Elle a d\u00e9crit les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences comme suit : [Traduction] \u00ab elles \u00e9taient toutes excellentes \u00bb. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Cyr avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement pr\u00eate et elle a donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses [Traduction] \u00ab solides \u00bb.\n[36] Des lettres semblables ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es le 12 avril 2007 \u00e0 Mme Pero et \u00e0 Mme Carriere pour leur offrir une nomination \u00e0 des postes de nettoyeurs pour une p\u00e9riode se terminant respectivement le 14 septembre 2007 et le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2008. Les notes du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation au sujet de l\u2019entrevue de Mme Pero montrent que ses r\u00e9ponses se situaient entre bon et tr\u00e8s bon. Les \u00e9valuations des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s bonnes. Les notes d\u2019\u00e9valuation au sujet de l\u2019entrevue de Mme Carriere montrent que ses r\u00e9ponses se situaient entre tr\u00e8s bon et excellent et ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e9taient aussi tr\u00e8s bonnes.\n[37] Mme Brown a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 ces femmes, elle avait conclu qu\u2019elles seraient la bonne personne pour chaque poste. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement impressionn\u00e9e par leur attitude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du travail et leur esprit d\u2019initiative, qualit\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans chacune des v\u00e9rifications de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Mme Brown a not\u00e9 que, pour les postes de nettoyeurs \u00e0 doter, les employ\u00e9s travaillaient sans supervision, donc le sens de l\u2019initiative d\u2019un candidat \u00e9tait un atout important.\n(ii) La candidature de M. Marchand [38] Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019avant la date de fermeture du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des demandes d\u2019emploi, M. Marchand lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour lui demander de confirmer que sa demande leur avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise. Elle l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait ouvrir une session sur le site Web de la Commission de la fonction publique (la CFP) et voir l\u2019\u00e9tat de sa demande. S\u2019il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver les renseignements, il pouvait la rappeler. Elle n\u2019a plus entendu parler de lui avant le 22 mars 2007, trois jours apr\u00e8s la date limite de pr\u00e9sentation des demandes, lorsqu\u2019il lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour se plaindre du fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter sa demande en ligne. Pendant la conversation, elle a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sa demande en ligne et l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu.\n[39] Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que comme la demande en ligne de M. Marchand ne d\u00e9crivait aucune de ses exp\u00e9riences d\u2019emploi, les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines avaient rejet\u00e9 sa demande parce qu\u2019elle ne satisfaisait pas aux qualifications d\u2019emploi essentielles pour le poste. Tout ce qu\u2019il avait fourni dans sa demande \u00e9tait une liste de ses employeurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, sans aucune description de ses t\u00e2ches ou de son exp\u00e9rience de travail.\n[40] Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que M. Marchand \u00e9tait m\u00e9content lorsqu\u2019il a appris qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 du processus. Il a dit \u00e0 Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard que le processus \u00e9tait injuste et inacceptable et il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il aviserait son d\u00e9put\u00e9 de la situation.\n[41] Compte tenu de la r\u00e9action de M. Marchand, Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard en a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur. Comme M. Marchand s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 plaint au sujet du processus en ligne avant la date de fermeture du processus de s\u00e9lection, le superviseur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter sa demande et son curriculum vitae sur papier. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Marchand pour l\u2019aviser de la d\u00e9cision de son superviseur.\n[42] Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun lien entre la d\u00e9cision du superviseur et une intervention quelconque du d\u00e9put\u00e9, comme M. Marchand l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9 entendre dans son t\u00e9moignage. Elle s\u2019est rappel\u00e9e avoir re\u00e7u un appel d\u2019un \u00ab ombudsman \u00bb, \u00e0 qui un d\u00e9put\u00e9 avait demand\u00e9 d\u2019examiner le dossier de M. Marchand. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 que cet appel avait eu lieu bien apr\u00e8s que son bureau eut d\u00e9j\u00e0 accept\u00e9 la demande papier de M. Marchand. L\u2019intervention de l\u2019ombudsman n\u2019avait eu aucun effet sur la d\u00e9cision de permettre \u00e0 M. Marchand de d\u00e9poser sa demande sur papier.\n[43] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de la copie papier de la demande de M. Marchand, sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9e pour la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Le guide de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection utilis\u00e9 par le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation mentionne que M. Marchand avait de nouveau n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de d\u00e9crire son exp\u00e9rience de travail en d\u00e9tail dans la demande ou de pr\u00e9ciser s\u2019il satisfaisait aux exigences essentielles quant \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de l\u2019utilisation de divers \u00e9quipements de nettoyage commercial. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Brown avait n\u00e9anmoins interc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et avait fourni au comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation sa connaissance personnelle selon laquelle M. Marchand poss\u00e9dait cette exp\u00e9rience. Le comit\u00e9 avait donc retenu la candidature de M. Marchand.\n[44] Comme M. Marchand \u00e9tait maintenant pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 dans le processus de nomination, le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue, qui a eu lieu le 24 mai 2007. \u00c0 ce moment, le MDN avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cyr, Mme Pero et Mme Carriere des lettres leur offrant un emploi.\n[45] Mme Brown a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien que les autres candidats qui avaient particip\u00e9 au processus eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s par elle\u2011m\u00eame et par Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard, elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 une troisi\u00e8me personne de participer aussi \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue de M. Marchand et de contribuer \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation. Selon Mme Brown, comme la demande de M. Marchand avait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par manque de renseignements et qu\u2019il semblait avoir des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de nomination, elle croyait qu\u2019il se sentirait [Traduction] \u00ab plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise \u00bb si une troisi\u00e8me personne \u00e9tait ajout\u00e9e au comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a ajout\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019en raison de ses interactions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes avec M. Marchand, lors desquelles il s\u2019\u00e9tait plaint au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont le processus de nomination se d\u00e9roulait, et afin de le rassurer quant \u00e0 la transparence du processus et \u00e0 l\u2019absence de manigances, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter une autre personne au comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour son entrevue. Mme Moorehead a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point M. Marchand \u00e9tait m\u00e9content du processus d\u2019embauche et a d\u00e9crit son attitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait souvent eu une attitude [Traduction] \u00ab belliqueuse \u00bb lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu au bureau des ressources humaines et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas sembl\u00e9 vouloir \u00e9couter les renseignements qu\u2019elle lui avait donn\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise en sa pr\u00e9sence et elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 son bureau, elle s\u2019assurait que deux de ses coll\u00e8gues gardent leur porte de bureau ouverte afin de surveiller sa rencontre avec lui.\n[46] Les notes que les trois membres du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation ont \u00e9crites sur les questionnaires qu\u2019ils ont utilis\u00e9s pendant l\u2019entrevue de M. Marchand ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. Chacun des interviewers a \u00e9crit que M. Marchand satisfaisait \u00e0 toutes les qualifications \u00e9valu\u00e9es par les questions. Cependant, les notes de son entrevue diff\u00e8rent grandement de celles \u00e9crites par Mme Brown et Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard au sujet de Mme Cyr, de Mme Pero et de Mme Carriere. Les deux intervieweuses avaient \u00e9crit [Traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s bon \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab excellent \u00bb dans la marge pour la majorit\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses de ces trois personnes aux questions. Un tableau de notation qui accompagnait le questionnaire montre que seule une personne qui obtient une note de bon \u00e0 excellent est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avoir satisfait \u00e0 la qualification requise.\n[47] Mme Brown a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ajoutait des notes dans la marge lorsqu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait qu\u2019un candidat s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9marqu\u00e9 et avait fourni une tr\u00e8s bonne ou une excellente r\u00e9ponse. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, comme on peut le voir sur les questionnaires, d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve, d\u2019une candidate pour laquelle le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e, Mme Brown avait \u00e9crit [Traduction] \u00ab faible \u00bb \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des questions pour lesquelles la candidate n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait la qualification requise.\n[48] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue de M. Marchand, le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation a effectu\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. Il avait annex\u00e9 deux lettres de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son curriculum vitae, dont l\u2019une avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par Mme Brown en 1994 au sujet de son travail \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque comme nettoyeur \u00e0 la BFC Shilo. La deuxi\u00e8me lettre provenait d\u2019un ancien employeur dans une industrie qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019entretien des immeubles et elle \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e de 2004. La personne qui avait sign\u00e9 la lettre ne travaillait plus pour cet employeur et le comit\u00e9 avait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de la retrouver pour obtenir des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet de M. Marchand.\n[49] Mme Brown et Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard avaient partag\u00e9 la t\u00e2che de communiquer avec les personnes donn\u00e9es en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour tous les candidats, en fonction de leur disponibilit\u00e9 respective. Pour cette v\u00e9rification, le membre du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation posait la s\u00e9rie des questions pr\u00e9vues et \u00e9crivait les r\u00e9ponses sur le formulaire. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a communiqu\u00e9 avec les trois autres r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dont M. Marchand avait donn\u00e9 le nom et a inform\u00e9 le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation des renseignements qu\u2019elle avait recueillis. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e9taient positives et que les commentaires de son gestionnaire actuel \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement [Traduction] \u00ab forts \u00bb. Cependant, l\u2019une des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 un emploi que M. Marchand avait anciennement occup\u00e9, 12 ans plus t\u00f4t. La troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9tait une personne qui n\u2019avait pas personnellement supervis\u00e9 le travail de M. Marchand. Toutes les personnes avec qui Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard avait communiqu\u00e9 avaient r\u00e9pondu que les comp\u00e9tences de M. Marchand \u00e9taient bonnes ou tr\u00e8s bonnes en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 toutes les questions qu\u2019elle leur avait pos\u00e9es.\n[50] Mme Brown a cependant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que pendant que M. Marchand travaillait pour sa compagnie de nettoyage entre 2005 et 2006, un officier militaire sup\u00e9rieur responsable de l\u2019administration de certaines des installations de la base l\u2019avait avis\u00e9e qu\u2019un des employ\u00e9s avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement contre M. Marchand. L\u2019incident se serait produit alors qu\u2019il nettoyait la cuisine de la base. \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019officier, Mme Brown avait affect\u00e9 M. Marchand \u00e0 un autre lieu de travail sur la base pendant que l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019incident se d\u00e9roulait et elle lui avait offert la possibilit\u00e9 de suivre une s\u00e9ance de sensibilisation, aux frais de sa compagnie. M. Marchand avait refus\u00e9 la formation. Bien que M. Marchand e\u00fbt reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019une plainte de harc\u00e8lement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e contre lui et qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 la formation, il a ni\u00e9 le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, soutenant qu\u2019il avait simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans une dispute entre son \u00e9pouse (qui \u00e9tait une des employ\u00e9es \u00e0 la cuisine) et les autres [Traduction] \u00ab filles \u00bb qui y travaillaient. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet de l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[51] En ce qui a trait aux r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de Mme Cyr, de Mme Pero et de Mme Carriere, les entrevues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par Mme Brown. Les personnes avec qui elle a communiqu\u00e9 pour les trois femmes ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que leurs comp\u00e9tences se situaient entre tr\u00e8s bonnes et excellentes. Tous les renseignements fournis \u00e9taient r\u00e9cents. Ces \u00e9valuations se d\u00e9marquaient de celles de tous les autres candidats, y compris M. Marchand.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de M. Marchand, le comit\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il satisfaisait aux qualifications essentielles du processus de nomination. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a envoy\u00e9 une lettre le 6 juin 2007 pour l\u2019aviser de cette conclusion et du fait que son nom serait plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir duquel il pourrait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 si des postes devaient \u00eatre dot\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit de la lettre dans laquelle le num\u00e9ro de case postale de M. Marchand avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal \u00e9crit (les deux derniers chiffres avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 intervertis). Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, Mme Moorehead a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines n\u2019avaient seulement remarqu\u00e9 l\u2019erreur que lorsque M. Marchand leur avait rendu visite en ao\u00fbt pour faire le point sur son dossier, et que c\u2019est alors qu\u2019une copie de la lettre initiale du comit\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e.\n[53] Le nom de M. Marchand est toujours dans le bassin des candidats qui se sont qualifi\u00e9s lors de ce processus de nomination pour des postes temporaires \u00e0 temps plein et il pourrait toujours \u00eatre embauch\u00e9 pour doter un poste.\n(iii) Le deuxi\u00e8me processus de nomination \u2013 un seul poste permanent \u00e0 temps plein [54] Selon Mme Brown et Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard, quelques mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du premier processus de nomination, la direction a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de combler un poste permanent de nettoyeur, poste qui \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 par une personne qui allait prendre sa retraite. Comme l\u2019annonce du premier processus de nomination ne mentionnait que des postes \u00e0 temps plein dot\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lancer et d\u2019annoncer un processus de nomination distinct pour le poste permanent. Les candidatures pour le deuxi\u00e8me processus devaient \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es au plus tard le 20 juin 2007.\n[55] Cependant, la direction a aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que toutes les personnes qui s\u2019\u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9es pour le premier processus seraient automatiquement pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es pour le deuxi\u00e8me processus. Elles n\u2019auraient pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leur candidature \u00e0 nouveau. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ses employ\u00e9s ont communiqu\u00e9 avec les candidats qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le bassin, y compris M. Marchand, et leur ont demand\u00e9 si elles \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du deuxi\u00e8me bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, \u00e0 partir duquel une nomination \u00e0 un poste permanent serait effectu\u00e9e. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Marchand et qu\u2019il a souhait\u00e9 que sa candidature soit incluse dans le deuxi\u00e8me processus. Des douze personnes qui s\u2019\u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9es dans le premier processus, neuf (sept femmes et deux hommes) ont accept\u00e9 de participer au deuxi\u00e8me processus. Neuf nouvelles candidatures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019annonce du deuxi\u00e8me processus (sept femmes et deux hommes), desquelles sept ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es qualifi\u00e9es (cinq femmes et deux hommes). Par cons\u00e9quent, un bassin a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli avec un total de 19 candidats (14 femmes et cinq hommes), y compris M. Marchand, qui \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s pour une nomination \u00e0 des postes de nettoyeurs quel que soit le statut (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les postes permanents et les postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e).\n[56] Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2007, apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u00e9finitif du bassin \u00e9largi de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, Mme Brown a \u00e9crit un courriel \u00e0 Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard et \u00e0 Mme Moorehead pour confirmer que Mme Cyr serait nomm\u00e9e au poste permanent. Dans ce courriel, Mme Brown exposait le raisonnement suivi pour la nomination. Elle d\u00e9clarait que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et sur ses propres [Traduction] \u00ab interactions \u00bb avec Mme Cyr et que cette derni\u00e8re serait la [Traduction] \u00ab meilleure personne \u00bb pour le poste, une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9vidente au principe de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb mentionn\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence au sujet de la dotation dans la fonction publique. Mme Brown a ajout\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait grandement fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019entregent excellent de Mme Cyr et le fait qu\u2019elle travaillait tr\u00e8s bien avec tous les autres nettoyeurs et ses pairs ainsi qu\u2019avec les membres des FC qui r\u00e9sidaient \u00e0 la base. Mme Brown a aussi not\u00e9 que l\u2019attitude de Mme Cyr \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du travail \u00e9tait excellent, qu\u2019elle faisait preuve d\u2019une grande initiative, qu\u2019elle avait de bonnes comp\u00e9tences organisationnelles et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait capable de prioriser. Mme Brown a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fiable, coop\u00e9rative et extr\u00eamement consciencieuse. Elle a conclu en d\u00e9clarant que la candidate \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab assur\u00e9ment un atout \u00bb.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 23 ao\u00fbt 2007, Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Cyr pour lui offrir le poste permanent \u00e0 temps plein de nettoyeur \u00e0 la BFC Shilo.\n[58] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les explications du MDN de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 lors de la dotation des postes de nettoyeurs \u00e0 la BFC Shilo en 2007, objet de la plainte de M. Marchand, sont les suivantes :\na) M. Marchand a mal rempli sa demande en ligne pour le premier processus de dotation, omettant d\u2019inscrire des renseignements au sujet de son exp\u00e9rience de travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il satisfaisait aux qualifications essentielles du poste et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 du processus.\nb) M. Marchand a exprim\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue du processus et a soutenu qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter une copie papier de sa demande.\nc) Le MDN a chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis et a accept\u00e9 de permettre que M. Marchand r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le processus en lui permettant de pr\u00e9senter une copie papier de son curriculum vitae\nd) \u00c0 ce moment, le premier processus d\u2019emploi avait suivi son cours normal, les autres candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s et plusieurs nominations \u00e0 des postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es.\ne) Lorsque l\u2019\u00e9valuation de M. Marchand a \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu dans le bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, \u00e0 partir duquel il pouvait toujours \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 si de nouveaux postes devaient \u00eatre dot\u00e9s.\nf) Lorsque le deuxi\u00e8me processus de nomination a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9, pour le poste permanent, M. Marchand a automatiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans le bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s, avec tous les autres candidats qui s\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualifi\u00e9s (des hommes et des femmes).\ng) Mme Cyr a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour le poste permanent parce que les r\u00e9sultats de son \u00e9valuation \u00e9taient exceptionnels et que le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation a conclu qu\u2019elle serait la bonne personne pour le poste, suivant les principes applicables de la dotation dans la fonction publique.\nh) Alors que les \u00e9valuations de Mme Cyr et des autres personnes nomm\u00e9es variaient de bon \u00e0 excellent, l\u2019\u00e9valuation de M. Marchand montrait simplement qu\u2019il satisfaisait aux crit\u00e8res.\ni) Le sexe de M. Marchand n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un facteur dans les nominations qui font l\u2019objet de sa plainte. En ce qui a trait aux nominations d\u2019avril 2007 aux postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il n\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas un candidat en raison de sa demande incompl\u00e8te. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la nomination permanente, Mme Cyr \u00e9tait clairement la meilleure candidate et la bonne personne pour le poste.\n[59] Je conclus que cette explication est raisonnable et qu\u2019elle est enti\u00e8rement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve. Les impressions de M. Marchand au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont la dotation des postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et du poste permanent s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en 2007 \u00e9taient \u00e9videmment erron\u00e9es. Les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience montrent que le MDN a lanc\u00e9 deux processus de nomination distincts. La candidature de M. Marchand n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de nominations parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 en raison des renseignements inad\u00e9quats qu\u2019il avait fournis sur sa demande en ligne. M. Marchand avait des pr\u00e9occupations v\u00e9ritables et l\u00e9gitimes au sujet du fait qu\u2019il devait pr\u00e9senter une demande en ligne. La CFP semble avoir chang\u00e9 sa politique depuis. Lyle Borden, un agent sup\u00e9rieur de la politique de dotation du MDN, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les candidats peuvent maintenant pr\u00e9senter leurs demandes en ligne ou sur papier. Cependant, nonobstant les obstacles cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la proc\u00e9dure de demande en ligne, il reste que l\u2019exclusion initiale de M. Marchand du processus de nomination n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 son sexe, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de fournir des renseignements essentiels dans sa demande.\n[60] En fait, il a m\u00eame omis de fournir ces renseignements sur son curriculum vitae sur papier, qu\u2019il a pu pr\u00e9senter plus tard de fa\u00e7on exceptionnelle. La seule raison pour laquelle il a pu \u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans le processus \u00e9tait que Mme Brown avait interc\u00e9d\u00e9 en sa faveur et avait personnellement confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il satisfaisait aux qualifications essentielles de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience.\n[61] Lorsque le temps est venu de nommer une personne au poste permanent, M. Marchand a automatiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans le nouveau bassin de candidats, avec son consentement. La personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e, Mme Cyr, \u00e9tait une candidate exceptionnelle en comparaison avec les autres candidats du bassin, qui \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 tant de femmes que d\u2019hommes. Il convient de noter qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que Mme Cyr avait un excellent entregent, ce qui a contribu\u00e9 au fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la bonne personne pour le poste. Mme Brown a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un point important pour le poste, parce que les employ\u00e9s interagissent souvent avec les personnes qui habitent sur la base et avec les autres employ\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce sujet, l\u2019impression que Mme Brown avait de Mme Cyr contrastait avec celle qu\u2019elle avait de M. Marchand. Mme Brown \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Marchand par le pass\u00e9 et le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation, ainsi que les employ\u00e9s du bureau des ressources humaines, savaient aussi qu\u2019il avait utilis\u00e9 un ton plut\u00f4t agressif lorsqu\u2019il avait exprim\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le processus de nomination se d\u00e9roulait. Dans les circonstances, il \u00e9tait plus que raisonnable de conclure que Mme Cyr \u00e9tait la [Traduction] \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb, plus que l\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 M. Marchand, en particulier en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019entregent.\n[62] M. Marchand a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments dans la preuve pour soutenir que les explications du MDN ne sont qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte pour les actes discriminatoires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis contre lui. Par exemple, il s\u2019interroge sur la raison pour laquelle il \u00e9tait le seul candidat pour lequel une troisi\u00e8me personne a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Cependant, les explications fournies tant par Mme Brown que Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement raisonnables dans les circonstances. M. Marchand avait soulev\u00e9 des objections importantes contre l\u2019exigence de pr\u00e9senter sa demande en ligne, exigence au sujet de laquelle il soutenait qu\u2019elle avait des r\u00e9percussions injustes sur les personnes comme lui dont les aptitudes informatiques \u00e9taient limit\u00e9es. Il s\u2019est interrog\u00e9 sur le caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gitime du processus de nomination et a exprim\u00e9 ouvertement son m\u00e9contentement. Il a menac\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 son d\u00e9put\u00e9 et il a parl\u00e9 dans un ton qui a forc\u00e9 Mme Moorehead \u00e0 prendre certaines mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il se rendait \u00e0 son bureau. Compte tenu de ces faits, il \u00e9tait compr\u00e9hensible que le comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation choisisse d\u2019ajouter une troisi\u00e8me personne pour donner \u00e0 M. Marchand plus de confiance envers la transparence du processus.\n[63] De plus, M. Marchand a laiss\u00e9 entendre que Mme Brown avait nomm\u00e9 Mme Cyr et les autres femmes parce qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient ses amies. Pourtant, il a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il se consid\u00e9rait comme l\u2019un des amis de Mme Brown lui aussi. Il faut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que, dans ce qui semble \u00eatre un effectif de taille modeste de nettoyeurs \u00e0 la base, une certaine amiti\u00e9 se d\u00e9veloppe. N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame si Mme Brown avait fait preuve de favoritisme personnel envers Mme Cyr ou l\u2019une des autres candidates choisies, cela ne contribue pas \u00e0 la conclusion selon laquelle le sexe \u00e9tait un des facteurs menant aux nominations.\n[64] M. Marchand a aussi soulev\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage des doutes quant \u00e0 l\u2019embauche de Mme Carriere, alors qu\u2019elle ne poss\u00e8de pas de permis de conduire. Cependant, il est possible qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant du fait que l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite pour les postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 deux semaines apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re annonce d\u2019emploi. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la d\u00e9tention d\u2019un permis de conduire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convertie d\u2019une condition essentielle d\u2019emploi \u00e0 un besoin op\u00e9rationnel, ce qui signifiait que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der un permis d\u00e9pendait des besoins du poste particulier \u00e0 doter. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ce changement n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en vue de favoriser une personne en particulier. La gestion l\u2019avait avis\u00e9 que les postes de nettoyeurs \u00e0 la base ne n\u00e9cessitaient pas tous la d\u00e9tention d\u2019un permis de conduire. Mme Brown a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les nettoyeurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail \u00e0 moins d\u2019endroits sur la base. Par cons\u00e9quent, la capacit\u00e9 de conduire d\u2019un lieu \u00e0 un autre n\u2019\u00e9tait plus n\u00e9cessaire pour effectuer le travail. Mme Barnes\u2011Girouard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019exigence a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e des qualifications essentielles parce qu\u2019en la maintenant, des candidats possibles qui n\u2019avaient pas de permis se seraient [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e9limin\u00e9s \u00bb eux\u2011m\u00eames du processus et auraient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas pr\u00e9senter leur candidature. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la modification \u00e0 des annonces pour ce type de raison n\u2019est pas inhabituelle dans un processus de dotation, un point que M. Borden a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme la possession d\u2019un permis de conduire n\u2019\u00e9tait plus une qualification essentielle, Mme Carriere pouvait se qualifier pour le poste.\n[65] Enfin, il convient aussi de mentionner que M. Marchand a soulev\u00e9 des questions au sujet des obligations du MDN de promouvoir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi dans son effectif. Les annonces pour les postes de nettoyeurs mentionnaient que les nominations pouvaient se limiter \u00e0 la s\u00e9lection de membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi (les Autochtones, les membres de groupes de minorit\u00e9 visible, les personnes handicap\u00e9es et les femmes). Dans la copie papier de sa demande, M. Marchand s\u2019est auto\u2011identifi\u00e9 comme membre d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 (les personnes handicap\u00e9es). Cependant, il n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[66] M. Borden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que toutes les annonces du MDN comprennent une clause semblable sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et que, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, elle n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas comprise dans les crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels pour le processus de nomination. Par cons\u00e9quent, le gestionnaire qui embauche a enti\u00e8rement le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de tenir compte de ce facteur lorsqu\u2019il choisit la personne qui sera nomm\u00e9e. Les gestionnaires tiennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement compte des plans de l\u2019organisation en mati\u00e8re de ressources humaines, d\u2019activit\u00e9s et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, et de l\u2019existence de toute lacune entre la proportion des personnes d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 qui sont employ\u00e9es dans un effectif en particulier et de la proportion correspondante de personnes qualifi\u00e9es du groupe qui se trouvent sur le march\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En 2007, les quatre groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s \u00e9taient sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la cat\u00e9gorie GS\u2011BUS\u20112 au MDN pour la r\u00e9gion du Manitoba (\u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de Winnipeg). En 2009, les donn\u00e9es montraient que les personnes handicap\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient plus sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et, qu\u2019en fait, elles \u00e9taient surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Cependant, M. Borden a not\u00e9 que m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il existe une lacune, un gestionnaire peut donner plus d\u2019importance aux comp\u00e9tences que l\u2019organisation recherche, afin de garantir que la [Traduction] \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb est s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e, qu\u2019aux consid\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n[67] Le MDN n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas tenu d\u2019appliquer les crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qui serait la bonne personne pour les nominations. De toute fa\u00e7on, m\u00eame s\u2019il l\u2019avait fait, il est fortement conjectural de pr\u00e9sumer que M. Marchand aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9, puisque les quatre groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s (et non pas seulement les personnes handicap\u00e9es) \u00e9taient sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en 2007, et qu\u2019il restait toujours la question de son entregent par rapport \u00e0 celui des autres candidats, comme Mme Cyr. De plus, il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de quelle fa\u00e7on la d\u00e9cision de ne pas limiter la dotation des postes \u00e0 des membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi constituerait une preuve de discrimination envers lui fond\u00e9e sur le motif du sexe, qui est le fondement de sa plainte.\nIV. Conclusion [68] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que le sexe de M. Marchand n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision du MDN de ne pas le nommer \u00e0 l\u2019un des postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou au poste permanent. Le MDN a fourni une explication compl\u00e8te et raisonnable des circonstances qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la nomination des femmes aux postes de nettoyeurs et M. Marchand n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019explication n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte pour une pratique qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement discriminatoire.\n[69] La plainte n'est donc pas fond\u00e9e et elle est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

CONCLUSION.. 61\nAnnexe \u00ab A \u00bb.\nI. R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 DE D\u00c9CISION [1] Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (le MAINC) finance les fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations qui dispensent des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance) aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans des r\u00e9serves. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ou la plaignante) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN, ou la plaignante) affirment que le MAINC ne fait pas qu\u2019offrir du financement. Il fournirait aussi des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 ces enfants, directement ou indirectement. Selon les plaignantes, le financement est inad\u00e9quat si on le compare \u00e0 celui que les provinces procurent aux autres enfants vivant hors r\u00e9serve. Elles soutiennent que ce financement d\u00e9favorise les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP, ou la Loi).\n[2] La Couronne demande, par voie de requ\u00eate, que soit rendue une d\u00e9cision portant que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour conna\u00eetre des questions d\u00e9coulant de la plainte. Essentiellement, elle fait valoir que le financement, ou les paiements de transfert, ne correspondent pas \u00e0 la fourniture de \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de la LCDP et que le financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC ne peut \u00eatre compar\u00e9, en droit, au financement vers\u00e9 par les provinces. Elle affirme que ces deux questions peuvent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es d\u00e8s maintenant et sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te comportant la comparution de t\u00e9moins et la production d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[3] La LCDP n\u2019oblige pas le Tribunal \u00e0 tenir une audience avec t\u00e9moins dans tous les cas. Dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il revient \u00e0 la Couronne de d\u00e9montrer que c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle doit convaincre le Tribunal que les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des observations et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Le Tribunal n\u2019accueillera la requ\u00eate visant le rejet d\u2019une plainte que s\u2019il est impossible de concevoir que la production d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve puisse \u00eatre de quelque utilit\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire lorsque la Couronne a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les faits sont clairs, qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s en entier et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, ou encore, que les questions en litige sont de pures questions de droit. Si la Couronne s\u2019acquitte de ce fardeau de preuve, le Tribunal peut statuer sur les questions de fond dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate.\n[4] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Couronne me demande de statuer sur deux questions de principe :\ni. Le programme de financement du MAINC est-il un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi?\nii. Peut-on conclure \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable en comparant entre eux deux fournisseurs de services diff\u00e9rents, et m\u00eame, est-il n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir une comparaison?\n[5] En ce qui concerne la question relative aux services, la Couronne n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les faits sont clairs, qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s en entier et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Je ne peux donc pas me prononcer sur cette question. Quant \u00e0 la question de la comparaison, elle s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau. Elle m\u2019a convaincue que la question de la \u00ab comparaison \u00bb en est une de droit uniquement. Je peux ainsi statuer sur cette question en me fondant sur les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate. Je conclus que la LCDP exige en effet qu\u2019une comparaison soit \u00e9tablie, mais pas celle que proposent les plaignantes. On ne peut comparer entre eux deux fournisseurs de services diff\u00e9rents. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si je concluais que le MAINC est un fournisseur de services ainsi que l\u2019affirment les plaignantes, la LCDP ne permet pas qu\u2019en tant que fournisseur de services, il soit compar\u00e9 aux provinces qui le sont aussi. La plainte ne pourrait \u00eatre accueillie en d\u00e9pit de la tenue d\u2019une instruction plus approfondie au sujet de la question des services. La plainte doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Mes motifs sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. Services [6] Par suite de la requ\u00eate de la Couronne, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suivants. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Couronne et les plaignantes, ainsi que deux intervenants, les Chiefs of Ontario (les Chefs) et Amnistie Internationale (Amnistie), ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les documents et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les observations \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 au crible les documents produits se rapportant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, ce qui repr\u00e9sente plus de 10 000 pages. Ironiquement, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019abondance de documents, le tout semble bien insuffisant pour parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte dans toute sa port\u00e9e et son \u00e9tendue.\n[7] Le r\u00e9gime de financement du MAINC est complexe. Le MAINC accorde du financement \u00e0 108 fournisseurs de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res nations afin qu\u2019ils dispensent des services de cet ordre \u00e0 quelque 160 000 enfants et adolescents au sein d\u2019environ 447 des 663 Premi\u00e8res nations. Pour la seule Directive 20-1, il existe possiblement au moins 50 \u00e0 60 ententes de financement et protocoles d\u2019ententes (qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 produits). Entre les divers territoires et provinces, on constate des diff\u00e9rences dans les r\u00e9gimes de financement et les mod\u00e8les de service, par exemple entre les r\u00e9serves autonomes et les autres r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Quelles sont les modalit\u00e9s et conditions pr\u00e9vues par ces diverses ententes de financement? Quelles sont celles qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 chacun des divers protocoles d\u2019ententes? Le MAINC a-t-il un droit de regard sur le type d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dispens\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des modalit\u00e9s et conditions de financement? Ces modalit\u00e9s et conditions servent-elles \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la teneur de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance? De plus, les mesures de v\u00e9rification du MAINC visent\u2011elles simplement \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les fonds sont utilis\u00e9s et g\u00e9r\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re responsable ou vont-elles plus loin? Les mesures de v\u00e9rification du MAINC sont-elles dans les faits une action d\u00e9montrant que le MAINC dispense de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance? Encore une fois, m\u00eame si les paiements de transfert ne sont dans l\u2019ensemble que des paiements de transfert, y a-t-il, au sein de l\u2019administration du programme, un volet distinct pour lequel il est possible d\u2019affirmer que le MAINC exerce un contr\u00f4le sur la teneur de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance? La Couronne ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau. On ne peut affirmer que les faits pertinents sont clairs, qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s en entier et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Cela est en partie attribuable \u00e0 la port\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, qui va plus loin que toute plainte dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie \u00e0 ce jour. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) n\u2019a pas enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur les faits pertinents avant de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il tienne une audience. Elle a plut\u00f4t \u00e9crit que les [traduction] \u00ab principaux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sont de nature juridique et non factuelle et ne d\u00e9coulent d\u2019aucun principe juridique \u00e9tabli \u00bb.\n[8] Ind\u00e9pendamment de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte, il incombe au Tribunal d\u2019aider les parties \u00e0 resserrer minutieusement les questions de faits, qui sont vastes et complexes, tout en cernant et en d\u00e9finissant les questions de droit \u00e9videntes que soul\u00e8ve la plainte. Pour atteindre cet objectif, j\u2019ai notamment offert aux parties de prendre part \u00e0 un processus de m\u00e9diation avec un membre du Tribunal afin de mieux circonscrire les questions de droit et de fait. Les parties ne sont pas parvenues \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur les faits importants. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, elles ont choisi de ne pas d\u00e9poser au Tribunal un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. Compte tenu de l\u2019ampleur de la plainte et du fait que ses param\u00e8tres sont insuffisamment d\u00e9finis, je ne puis me prononcer sur la question concernant les services \u00e0 partir de la preuve produite.\nB. Comparaison [9] Toutefois, je suis en mesure de trancher, sur la base de la preuve et des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, la question relative \u00e0 la comparaison. Je peux d\u00e9cider si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de traitement d\u00e9favorable est mal fond\u00e9e en droit. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un fournisseur de services destin\u00e9s au public ne peut d\u00e9favoriser un individu \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture. La question de savoir si ces mots employ\u00e9s dans la LCDP appellent une comparaison et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quel est le mode d\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cette comparaison, rel\u00e8ve purement du droit. La Couronne est parvenue \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pure question de droit qui peut d\u00e8s maintenant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e. Les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de cette question de droit. Il n\u2019est d\u2019autre preuve que les plaignantes pourraient d\u00e9poser pour \u00e9tayer davantage leur position.\n[10] Je tranche la question comme suit : pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable, il faut comparer la situation des victimes pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es \u00e0 celle d\u2019une autre personne recevant ces m\u00eames services du m\u00eame fournisseur. Comment peut-on \u00eatre autrement d\u00e9favoris\u00e9? Il convient de donner au terme employ\u00e9 dans la LCDP son sens manifeste, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Ce terme ne se trouve que dans la LCDP. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans Singh c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re des Affaires ext\u00e9rieures), [1989] 1 C.F. 430 (C.A.F.) (Singh), a jug\u00e9 que ce terme exigeait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse comparative. De plus, une telle comparaison est sollicit\u00e9e dans la plainte m\u00eame. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une comparaison entre le financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC et celui accord\u00e9 par les provinces se situe en effet au c\u0153ur de la plainte.\n[11] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question du choix d\u2019un groupe de comparaison, les parties conviennent que le MAINC ne finance et ne r\u00e9glemente pas l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants ne vivant pas dans les r\u00e9serves. Pour ces derniers, la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est une comp\u00e9tence exclusive des provinces tombant sous le coup de l\u2019article 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (R.-U.), 30 & 31 Vict., ch. 3, reproduite dans L.R.C. 1985, app. II, no 5. Peut-on comparer le financement accord\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 celui d\u2019un gouvernement provincial pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorisant un individu au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi? La r\u00e9ponse est non.\n[12] La Loi ne permet pas de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une comparaison entre deux fournisseurs de services diff\u00e9rents et deux prestataires de services diff\u00e9rents. Le financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est destin\u00e9 aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves afin de leur offrir une aide. Le financement provincial est destin\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les enfants vivant hors r\u00e9serve. Il s\u2019agit de groupes distincts de fournisseurs de services et de prestataires de services. Il est impossible de comparer les deux.\n[13] Examinons le fonctionnement de la Loi. Par exemple, la Loi permet \u00e0 une personne autochtone qui re\u00e7oit moins de services d\u2019un gouvernement de d\u00e9poser une plainte si une personne qui n\u2019est pas autochtone re\u00e7oit de meilleurs services de ce m\u00eame gouvernement. Toutefois, la Loi ne permet pas \u00e0 une personne autochtone, ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit, de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il y a traitement d\u00e9favorable si une autre personne re\u00e7oit de meilleurs services d\u2019un gouvernement diff\u00e9rent.\n[14] S\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement, les r\u00e9percussions profondes du raisonnement propos\u00e9 se feraient sentir \u00e9galement dans le domaine de l\u2019emploi. Pour prendre un autre exemple, la Loi permet \u00e0 une personne autochtone que son employeur traite diff\u00e9remment de d\u00e9poser une plainte si un employ\u00e9 qui n\u2019est pas autochtone est mieux trait\u00e9 par ce m\u00eame employeur. Toutefois, la Loi ne permet pas \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 autochtone, ni \u00e0 quelque autre employ\u00e9, de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il y a traitement d\u00e9favorable si un autre employ\u00e9 est mieux trait\u00e9 par un employeur diff\u00e9rent.\n[15] Par ailleurs, un tel raisonnement irait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la personne membre d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation de faire valoir que celle-ci la d\u00e9favorise en \u00e9tablissant une comparaison entre les services qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit et ceux offerts par une autre Premi\u00e8re nation \u00e0 un autre membre.\n[16] Il n\u2019y aurait pas de limites aux comparaisons pouvant \u00eatre faites. De plus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la comparaison demand\u00e9e fait intervenir des administrations sans lien de d\u00e9pendance au vu de la Constitution : d\u2019une part, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et de l\u2019autre, les gouvernements des provinces et des territoires.\n[17] Sur ce point, les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de d\u00e9poser des affidavits, de contre-interroger les affiants, de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal avec leurs avocats et de pr\u00e9senter des arguments. En outre, elles se sont vu accorder la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations jusqu\u2019au 23 ao\u00fbt 2010 et jusqu\u2019au 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010 (voir l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb), respectivement, au sujet de trois nouvelles d\u00e9cisions. Il s\u2019agit de Commission des droits de la personne du Nouveau-Brunswick c. Province du Nouveau-Brunswick (Min. du D\u00e9veloppement social), 2010 NBCA 40 (CDPNB c. PNB), publi\u00e9e le 3 juin 2010, ainsi que de deux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada : NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society c. B.C. Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, 2010 CSC 45 (NIL\/TU,O) et Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, 2010 CSC 46 (Native Child and Family Services of Toronto), rendus ensemble le 4 novembre 2010. Les parties ont \u00e9galement eu la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des observations concernant la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, R\u00e9sol. A.G. 61\/295 (Annexe), DOAG ONU, 61e Sess., Supp. no 49, Vol. III, Doc. ONU A\/61\/49 (2008) 15 (la DNUDPA). Cette question de droit est suffisamment claire sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une autre audience avec t\u00e9moins et de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la tenue d\u2019une autre audience pourrait faire en sorte que du temps et des ressources soient engloutis dans un exercice interminable visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des faits qui ne sont d\u2019aucune pertinence par rapport \u00e0 la faille identifi\u00e9e sur le plan juridique. La tenue d\u2019une autre audience serait un exercice th\u00e9orique. La plainte ne peut \u00eatre accueillie sur ce point de droit.\nConsid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre culturel \u2013 membres des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada \u2013 Tradition orale\n[18] L\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate s\u2019est ouverte sur une pri\u00e8re algonquine r\u00e9cit\u00e9e par une a\u00een\u00e9e, Bertha Commanda. Je suis parfaitement consciente de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, pour trancher la requ\u00eate, de bien conna\u00eetre et de respecter les pr\u00e9occupations d\u2019ordre culturel des membres des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada. L\u2019APN, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la Commission soutiennent vigoureusement qu\u2019il faut tenir une audience et statuer que la LCDP permet de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en comparant les actions d\u2019un bailleur de fonds ou fournisseur de services fond\u00e9s sur la race, soit en l\u2019occurrence, le MAINC, \u00e0 celles des provinces. Je reconnais l\u2019importance de la tradition orale pour les Premi\u00e8res nations. Cela dit, si la pr\u00e9sente plainte avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une audience avec t\u00e9moins, une mesure inutile, cette audience aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 longue et complexe et le litige se serait possiblement prolong\u00e9 sur des ann\u00e9es. L\u2019audience aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 alourdie par les co\u00fbts forc\u00e9ment assum\u00e9s par les parties et les t\u00e9moins sur les plans financier et affectif. En fait, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de critiques de la part de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour sa mauvaise gestion d\u2019une audience sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale, qui a dur\u00e9 plus de dix ans et qui se poursuit (Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2010 CAF 56, au paragraphe 145 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes) (autorisation de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC accord\u00e9e, dossiers nos 33668, 33669, 33670). Il n\u2019est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ni des parties ni du syst\u00e8me judiciaire de tenir une audience viva voce au sujet d\u2019une plainte qui ne peut \u00eatre accueillie pour des raisons de droit. Cela n\u2019aurait pas pour effet de favoriser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice. Ce serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice.\n[19] Il faut comprendre que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la LCDP est trompeur. M\u00eame s\u2019il renferme l\u2019id\u00e9e que la LCDP et le Tribunal peuvent rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 toute une gamme de violations des droits de la personne, le mandat du Tribunal se limite \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination pour les motifs pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans la loi et dans les domaines qui y sont vis\u00e9s, tels que l\u2019emploi, les services et les moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, pour n\u2019en nommer que quelques-uns. Ainsi, il n\u2019est pas possible d\u2019accorder aux membres des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada ou \u00e0 leurs concitoyens canadiens des r\u00e9parations plus \u00e9tendues relevant des droits de la personne en l\u2019absence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi. \u00c0 moins que la plainte ne porte sur un objet vis\u00e9 par l\u2019un des articles de cette loi interdisant la discrimination, elle ne peut \u00eatre accueillie.\n[20] Enfin, je suis consciente que les membres des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada sont embourb\u00e9s dans un conflit constitutionnel. Toutefois, les outils juridiques permettant de contester un financement jug\u00e9 in\u00e9quitable ne se trouvent pas dans le texte actuel de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une cour de justice saisie d\u2019une contestation constitutionnelle. Il n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 red\u00e9finir le sens du terme \u00ab traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00bb pour l\u2019adapter aux circonstances. Le Tribunal doit pr\u00e9server son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 en ne d\u00e9bordant pas du cadre de la loi qui l\u2019a cr\u00e9\u00e9. Il se pourrait fort bien que les plaintes soient recevables dans le cadre d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, d\u2019une action politique ou de consultations en cours \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale; il se pourrait aussi qu\u2019elles obligent \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des modifications l\u00e9gislatives. Les arguments louables formul\u00e9s par le groupe des plaignantes pourraient fort bien recueillir l\u2019adh\u00e9sion de ceux qui ont comp\u00e9tence pour les entendre.\nII. SUR QUOI LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE PORTE-T-ELLE? [21] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et l\u2019APN affirment que le financement des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est insuffisant pour des milliers d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. L\u2019aide destin\u00e9e aux enfants vivant hors r\u00e9serve est financ\u00e9e par les provinces et les territoires. Les plaignantes demandent que la loi oblige le MAINC \u00e0 financer l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 un niveau semblable \u00e0 celui en vigueur dans les provinces et territoires. Elles pr\u00e9tendent que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve re\u00e7oivent moins de services d\u2019aide et de protection de l\u2019enfance que les autres enfants canadiens vivant hors r\u00e9serve, que ce soit \u00e0 un jet de pierre d\u2019une r\u00e9serve. Selon elles, les provinces consacrent \u00e0 l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance beaucoup plus de fonds que le MAINC et que ce sous-financement du MAINC constitue pour les enfants autochtones vivant dans les r\u00e9serves de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Les plaignantes pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019en raison de ce sous-financement, la prestation des services se fait d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019est pas adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 culturelle de ces enfants, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019objet du programme de financement. Elles sollicitent du Tribunal une ordonnance enjoignant au MAINC de verser 109 millions de dollars additionnels annuellement afin de combler les lacunes actuelles sur le plan du financement.\n[22] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les plaignantes pr\u00e9tendent que le mode de financement pr\u00e9vu au chapitre 5 de la Directive 20-1 (la Directive 20-1) est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi en ce sens que les enfants inscrits et les familles des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves re\u00e7oivent des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance d\u2019un niveau in\u00e9quitable en raison de leur race et de leur origine nationale ou ethnique par rapport aux enfants, autochtones ou non, qui vivent hors r\u00e9serve. Les pr\u00e9cisions et les actes de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par le groupe de plaignantes \u00e9largissent la port\u00e9e de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e au Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations (le Programme des SEFPN) du MAINC, qui vise \u00e0 la fois le financement de la Directive 20-1 et de l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention (AAAP), et les fonds que verse le MAINC \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario sous le r\u00e9gime du Protocole d\u2019entente sur les programmes d\u2019aide sociale pour les Indiens de 1965, connu sous le nom d\u2019Entente sur le bien-\u00eatre social de 1965 (l\u2019Entente de 1965).\nIII. SUR QUOI LA PR\u00c9SENTE REQU\u00caTE PORTE-T-ELLE? A. La Couronne affirme que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte [23] L\u2019intim\u00e9, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (la Couronne) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue du rejet de la plainte pour d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence; elle pr\u00e9tend que la plainte ne tombe pas sous le coup des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. Les autres parties affirment que la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et qu\u2019il y a lieu de proc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te de l\u2019affaire sur le fond.\nB. Quelles sont les questions en litige dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate?\niii. La Loi oblige-t-elle le Tribunal \u00e0 tenir une audience viva voce dans tous les cas?\niv. Dans la n\u00e9gative, le Tribunal peut-il trancher les questions suivantes dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate :\n(a) Le MAINC fournit-il un service pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi? La question du financement est-elle justiciable?\n(b) Est-il n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel \u00e0 un groupe de comparaison pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi? Sinon, est-il permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir une comparaison entre deux fournisseurs de services?\nIV. LE TRIBUNAL PEUT-IL TRANCHER LES QUESTIONS SOULEV\u00c9ES DANS LE CADRE DE LA PR\u00c9SENTE REQU\u00caTE EN SE FONDANT SUR LES DOCUMENTS PRODUITS SANS TENIR D\u2019AUDIENCE VIVA VOCE? [24] Fondamentalement, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate exige de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu ou non de tenir une audience viva voce ainsi que le demandent les plaignantes ou si le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer d\u00e8s maintenant sur la plainte en se fondant sur les documents dont il dispose sans tenir d\u2019audience viva voce? Les parties ont des points de vue divergents en ce qui concerne le pouvoir du Tribunal de statuer sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci de l\u2019instance.\nA. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des positions des parties La Couronne\n[25] La position de la Couronne semble comporter plusieurs facettes. D\u2019une part, dans certains cas, la Couronne pr\u00e9tend que sa requ\u00eate soul\u00e8ve une question d\u2019ordre juridictionnel et que le Tribunal peut d\u00e9terminer les limites de sa propre comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 tout moment de l\u2019instruction. Les tribunaux de justice ont reconnu que le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience viva voce en cas de poursuite abusive. Or, la Couronne affirme que le fait de pr\u00e9senter une plainte qui outrepasse la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est un abus de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e8s lors susceptible de rejet sommaire. Toutefois, ailleurs dans ses observations, la Couronne d\u00e9clare que sa requ\u00eate concerne des questions touchant directement le \u00ab bien-fond\u00e9 \u00bb de la plainte. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle fait valoir qu\u2019il incombe aux plaignantes d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, une preuve prima facie de discrimination, et elle ajoute que ce fardeau demeure la responsabilit\u00e9 des plaignantes tout au long de l\u2019instruction. De plus, la Couronne affirme que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate sont des questions de droit que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher lorsqu\u2019il instruit et tranche les questions en litige. La Couronne d\u00e9nonce le recours aux crit\u00e8res juridiques \u00e9labor\u00e9s \u00e0 partir des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile, notamment celui du \u00ab caract\u00e8re manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb, que les tribunaux civils appliquent lorsqu\u2019elles sont saisies de requ\u00eates en radiation d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure dont on pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune cause d\u2019action valable.\nLa Commission\n[26] La position de la Commission comporte elle aussi plusieurs facettes. Premi\u00e8rement, celle-ci pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal peut uniquement rejeter une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une audience sur le fond, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure. M\u00eame dans un tel cas, le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte sommairement doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec beaucoup de prudence et seulement dans les cas les plus \u00e9vidents. Les exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure sont extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9es : la proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre injuste au point qu\u2019elle est contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Commission affirme que la question dont est saisi le Tribunal dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate est de savoir s\u2019il est \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb que les actes de proc\u00e9dure des plaignantes et de la Commission ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent aucune cause d\u2019action valable ou, s\u2019agissant de la LCDP, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la plainte \u00e9tait d\u00e9pourvue de tout fondement. Pour radier une plainte, le Tribunal doit conclure, en supposant qu\u2019il tient pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s et complets tous les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans les affidavits, que la plainte n\u2019a pas la moindre chance de r\u00e9ussir. De plus, la plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre radi\u00e9e si elle soul\u00e8ve d\u2019importantes questions de droit ou de port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou si d\u2019autres faits doivent \u00eatre connus pour pouvoir se prononcer sur le fond quant aux droits des plaignantes.\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\n[27] De l\u2019avis de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la Couronne doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il est \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb qu\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter la plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience viva voce et sans disposer d\u2019un dossier de preuve complet, et qu\u2019elle est contraire \u00e0 une directive de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant le contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de renvoi de la Commission. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 note que le Tribunal se montre r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 accueillir les requ\u00eates en rejet d\u2019une plainte, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de la LCDP et de l\u2019importance et des objectifs r\u00e9parateurs des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Deux caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res de la loi militent contre le recours au rejet sommaire : (i) les dispositions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9liminaire autorisant la Commission \u00e0 disposer d\u2019une plainte sans qu\u2019elle soit instruite par le Tribunal; (ii) l\u2019obligation du Tribunal, suivant le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, de donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations au sujet des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la plainte. Bien que la jurisprudence du Tribunal indique que ce dernier a le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte sur requ\u00eate lorsque les questions soulev\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instruites devant une autre instance ou qu\u2019il y a manquement \u00e9vident aux principes de justice naturelle, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 affirme \u00e9galement que les requ\u00eates en rejet d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9liminaire ne devraient pas \u00eatre accueillies lorsque la d\u00e9cision sur le fond requiert une appr\u00e9ciation des faits et une conclusion de fait ou que la plainte soul\u00e8ve une question de droit difficile et importante. Enfin, selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019affaire en cause n\u2019est pas de l\u2019ordre de celles qui peuvent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9liminaire. Elle met en cause un int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel important pour des milliers d\u2019enfants. Elle soul\u00e8ve des questions de droit difficiles et importantes jamais examin\u00e9es. Elle aura des cons\u00e9quences majeures sur le plan jurisprudentiel et elle repose sur des faits qui sont nombreux et complexes et qui influenceront l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\nLes Chefs\n[28] Les Chefs avancent que la requ\u00eate de la Couronne est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et inopportune compte tenu du refus de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire du renvoi de l\u2019affaire par la Commission pour instruction. Ils affirment que s\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident et manifeste que la plainte est sans le moindre fondement, la requ\u00eate de la Couronne doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. La Couronne doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il est manifeste et \u00e9vident que la plainte est vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec m\u00eame apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un dossier complet au Tribunal. Les Chefs font valoir que la question de comp\u00e9tence et les autres questions soulev\u00e9es par la Couronne doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es en fonction d\u2019une preuve compl\u00e8te, et non pas \u00e0 partir du dossier relativement maigre joint \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Il est crucial que le Tribunal soit saisi du dossier complet, compte tenu de l\u2019enjeu \u00e9norme qui d\u00e9pend de la requ\u00eate et qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP vise les programmes comportant un volet de financement. Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait n\u00e9gative, la majeure partie des programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux relatifs aux Premi\u00e8res nations ne serait pas assujettie \u00e0 un examen sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. Le fait de rendre une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire pourrait \u00e9galement porter atteinte aux parties en retardant l\u2019audience sur le fond, car si l\u2019affaire est class\u00e9e pour des motifs pr\u00e9liminaires et que la d\u00e9cision est renvers\u00e9e par les tribunaux sup\u00e9rieurs, les parties devront reprendre l\u2019affaire depuis le d\u00e9but, des ann\u00e9es plus tard (m\u00eame si elles sont pr\u00eates \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction sur le fond d\u00e8s maintenant). Lorsque le rejet pr\u00e9liminaire sera renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal, les principaux t\u00e9moins pourraient ne plus \u00eatre disponibles. Pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires, il n\u2019est pas souhaitable de fragmenter ainsi la proc\u00e9dure.\nB. La LCDP n\u2019exige pas la tenue d\u2019une audience viva voce dans tous les cas Les faits importants sont clairs et non contest\u00e9s ou il s\u2019agit de questions de pur droit\n[29] Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi et fait partie d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral destin\u00e9 \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer les cas de discrimination et \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question du caract\u00e8re opportun de la requ\u00eate en rejet sommaire n\u00e9cessite un examen de la Loi. En examinant tous les aspects pertinents de la loi habilitante du Tribunal, il est possible de d\u00e9terminer avec pr\u00e9cision quels types de d\u00e9cisions le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu permettre au Tribunal de rendre. Toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 de la loi habilitante doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solue de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 favoriser la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de la LCDP, et non de les contrecarrer (Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36, au paragraphe 42 (Bell Canada)).\n[30] Le Tribunal est un organe ind\u00e9pendant \u00e9tabli par la Loi afin d\u2019instruire les plaintes qui lui sont renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission. La Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 deux formes d\u2019instructions, l\u2019une avec audience viva voce et l\u2019autre sans. En vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 instruit la plainte et \u00ab donne \u00bb \u00e0 toutes les parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations. Le paragraphe 50(3) de la LCDP autorise le membre instructeur \u00e0 assigner et \u00e0 contraindre des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 faire une d\u00e9position et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces jug\u00e9es indispensables, \u00e0 faire pr\u00eater serment, \u00e0 recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des renseignements, par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9 et \u00e0 trancher toute question de proc\u00e9dure ou de preuve. Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 17 (Cremasco), conf. par Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019instruction se distinguait de l\u2019\u00ab audience \u00bb et ne correspondait pas au terme \u00ab audience \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 il est employ\u00e9 au paragraphe 50(3) de la Loi. Dans Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019emploi, par le l\u00e9gislateur, du mot \u00ab instruction \u00bb au paragraphe 50(1) et du mot \u00ab audience \u00bb au paragraphe 50(3) de la LCDP montrait clairement que le renvoi d\u2019une affaire au Tribunal ne conduisait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une audience dans tous les cas. Donc, s\u2019il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte avant de la rejeter, cela ne signifie pas \u00ab n\u00e9cessairement \u00bb qu\u2019une audience est requise.\n[31] Suivant le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi, le Tribunal doit proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction sans formalisme et de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible. Ainsi que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le d\u00e9clare dans Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 18, \u00ab il est difficile de voir pourquoi il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de quiconque que le Tribunal tienne une audience dans un cas o\u00f9 il estime qu\u2019une telle audience \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de sa proc\u00e9dure \u00bb. Dans de tels cas, le paragraphe 53(1) de la Loi permet de tirer une conclusion particuli\u00e8rement utile pour la question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude, \u00e0 savoir que le Tribunal peut rejeter la plainte \u00ab [\u00e0] l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction \u00bb.\n[32] L\u2019emploi r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019indicatif pr\u00e9sent (en anglais, \u00ab shall \u00bb) dans ces dispositions tend nettement \u00e0 indiquer que deux obligations sont impos\u00e9es au Tribunal. D\u2019une part, il doit proc\u00e9der sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle. De l\u2019autre, chaque fois qu\u2019il instruit une plainte, il doit veiller \u00e0 accorder aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Loi fait exception en codifiant l\u2019obligation impos\u00e9e par la common law, qui consiste \u00e0 adh\u00e9rer aux principes de justice naturelle ainsi qu\u2019aux principes de common law selon lesquels les tribunaux administratifs s\u2019acquittent de leur r\u00f4le sans formalisme et avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9, et elle juxtapose adroitement les uns et les autres au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 en faire des obligations oppos\u00e9es. Il appartient au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9tablir le juste \u00e9quilibre dans chaque cas.\n[33] L\u2019obligation de proc\u00e9der sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive qui est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 48.9(2) de la LCDP est sujette \u00e0 deux limites importantes : les principes de justice naturelle et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en date du 3 mai 2004 (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure).\n[34] Mais dans quels cas une plainte peut-elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sans la tenue d\u2019une audience viva voce? Ici aussi, la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, nous \u00e9claire. En effet, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que le Tribunal pouvait rejeter une affaire sans tenir d\u2019audience si une telle audience \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019affaire mettait en cause une forme particuli\u00e8re d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, soit la tentative de faire rejuger une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, un acte sanctionn\u00e9 par le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e, ou de pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. Il existe d\u2019autres formes d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, mais la question qui se pose imm\u00e9diatement est la suivante : la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, \u00e9nonce-t-elle la seule situation possible o\u00f9 le Tribunal est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 rejeter une plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience? Je ne le crois pas. Je suis d\u2019avis que la logique qui sous-tend cette d\u00e9cision fond\u00e9e sur le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP peut s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres contextes, \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019aucune plainte ne soit rejet\u00e9e avant l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction. Et comme nous l\u2019avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019obligation fondamentale \u00e0 laquelle est assujetti le Tribunal sur le plan de la proc\u00e9dure est de donner aux parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations (suivant le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi). Cependant, la teneur de ce qui est accord\u00e9 aux parties d\u00e9pendra de la nature de l\u2019affaire en cause et des motifs pour lesquels le rejet de la plainte est demand\u00e9.\n[35] Ainsi, lorsque le rejet d\u2019une plainte est demand\u00e9 par voie de requ\u00eate, il importe d\u2019examiner attentivement tous les fondements de la requ\u00eate afin de s\u2019assurer que chacun d\u2019eux se pr\u00eate \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u2014 rendue dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate\u2014 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi.\n[36] Cette analyse emporte comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019imposition d\u2019un double fardeau \u00e0 la partie qui pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate en rejet avant la tenue de l\u2019audience\nUn fardeau en mati\u00e8re proc\u00e9durale, consistant \u00e0 convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019il peut trancher les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate (par rapport \u00e0 une audience viva voce) de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et dans le respect int\u00e9gral de l\u2019obligation que lui impose la Loi, soit de donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre.\nUn fardeau quant au fond, consistant \u00e0 convaincre le Tribunal que les motifs de rejet sont valables.\n[37] Compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de la Loi et des objectifs du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif (\u00e0 savoir, entre autres, de promouvoir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances), il convient que la partie demandant que la plainte soit tranch\u00e9e sommairement justifie pourquoi il serait appropri\u00e9 de le faire. Concr\u00e8tement, si l\u2019on tient pour acquis que le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction et de pr\u00e9senter des observations, cela signifie que la partie requ\u00e9rante doit convaincre le Tribunal que l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate fournit un cadre o\u00f9 le droit de toutes les parties de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve est prot\u00e9g\u00e9, en ce sens qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire ne peut aider \u00e0 rendre la d\u00e9cision vis\u00e9e.\n[38] Cela peut se produire dans deux cas : a) lorsque la partie requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les faits importants de l\u2019affaire en cause sont clairs et ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et b) lorsque les questions soulev\u00e9es sont uniquement des questions de pur droit. D\u00e8s lors, il est inutile d\u2019obtenir d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\nC. Le fait de trancher une plainte en se fondant sur des faits non contest\u00e9s, ou une question de droit, dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction d\u2019une requ\u00eate est-il conforme aux principes de justice naturelle? Le cadre d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate est-il conforme aux principes de justice naturelle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce?\n[39] Les parties ont droit \u00e0 une audition \u00e9quitable (Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 817, aux paragraphes 22 et 28 (Baker); voir aussi Uniboard Surfaces Inc. c. Kronotex Fussboden GmbH et Co. KG, 2006 CAF 398, au paragraphe 26 (Uniboard)).\n[40] Les facteurs influen\u00e7ant la teneur de l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 22 \u00e0 27; il s\u2019agit notamment de la nature de la d\u00e9cision recherch\u00e9e et du processus suivi pour y parvenir, de la nature du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et des termes de la loi, de l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision pour les personnes vis\u00e9es, des attentes l\u00e9gitimes de la personne qui conteste la d\u00e9cision et des choix de proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019organisme fait lui-m\u00eame, particuli\u00e8rement quand il a une expertise et que la loi lui laisse la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir sa propre proc\u00e9dure. Il ne faut pas appliquer syst\u00e9matiquement chacun de ces cinq facteurs \u00e0 un processus donn\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t les adapter au contexte particulier (Uniboard, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Le respect de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse cas par cas (Ha c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2004 CAF 49 (Ha)).\n(i) Examen de la nature de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 rendre et du processus \u2013 dans quelle mesure s\u2019agit-il d\u2019un processus judiciaire? [41] Pour ce qui est du processus administratif, je remarque que celui du Tribunal s\u2019apparente beaucoup au processus judiciaire et qu\u2019on a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celui d\u2019une cour de justice puisque ses audiences \u00ab [\u2026] sont structur\u00e9es sensiblement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice \u00bb (voir Bell Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 23). Toutefois, les cours de justice n\u2019appliquent pas le \u00ab mod\u00e8le du proc\u00e8s \u00bb pour disposer de toutes les affaires (voir les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106, article 210 (requ\u00eate en jugement par d\u00e9faut); article 213 (requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire ou en proc\u00e8s sommaire); article 220 (d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire sur un point de droit ou d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9); article 221 (requ\u00eate en radiation d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure); partie 5 (demandes)). Par cons\u00e9quent, toute analogie entre le processus d\u00e9cisionnel du Tribunal et le \u00ab processus d\u00e9cisionnel judiciaire \u00bb doit tenir compte du fait qu\u2019une bonne partie des affaires tranch\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive ou potentiellement d\u00e9finitive dans le cadre du processus d\u00e9cisionnel judiciaire l\u2019est en marge du \u00ab mod\u00e8le du proc\u00e8s \u00bb.\n(ii) Examen du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et des termes de la Loi \u2013 dans quelle mesure la d\u00e9cision peut-elle \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de d\u00e9finitive? [42] La nature du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et les termes de la loi r\u00e9gissant le fonctionnement de l\u2019organisme doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du caract\u00e8re plus ou moins d\u00e9finitif de la d\u00e9cision en cause. S\u2019il est vrai que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal rejetant une plainte en vertu de la LCDP ne soit pas susceptible d\u2019appel, elle n\u2019est pas non plus prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par une clause privative et peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sans autorisation pr\u00e9alable, puis d\u2019un appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9, aux paragraphes 52, 64, 123 et 143; Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, art. 18, 27 et 28). Je remarque que dans Ha, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que le contr\u00f4le judiciaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un plein droit d\u2019appel car la comp\u00e9tence du juge charg\u00e9 du contr\u00f4le peut \u00eatre restreinte quant au fond de l\u2019affaire. Cela ne veut pas dire que la possibilit\u00e9 de demander un contr\u00f4le judiciaire n\u2019a aucune pertinence, surtout dans un cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 aucune clause privative n\u2019est pr\u00e9vue et o\u00f9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire peut \u00eatre obtenu sans autorisation et proc\u00e8de directement \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019arr\u00eat Ha, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, illustre bien ce point : il repose sur l\u2019examen du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif particulier de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 2001, ch. 27, art. 72, qui pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une autorisation est requise pour obtenir un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n(iii) Tenir compte de l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision pour les personnes vis\u00e9es [43] La Cour supr\u00eame a formul\u00e9 la directive suivante pour l\u2019examen de l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision pour les personnes vis\u00e9es : \u00ab Plus la d\u00e9cision est importante pour la vie des personnes vis\u00e9es et plus ses r\u00e9percussions sont grandes pour ces personnes, plus les protections proc\u00e9durales requises seront rigoureuses. \u00bb (Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 25). Or, toutes les d\u00e9cisions sont d\u2019une importance \u00e9gale pour ceux qui sont vis\u00e9s par elles et il faut donc examiner comment la d\u00e9cision peut r\u00e9ellement toucher les personnes concern\u00e9es. J\u2019estime que les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre culturel et constitutionnel qui trouvent \u00e9cho partout dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire militent en faveur d\u2019un degr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale important. Je suis \u00e9galement \u00e9minemment consciente de la nature quasi-constitutionnelle des litiges en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personnes, juxtapos\u00e9e au caract\u00e8re unique de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, des importantes ramifications culturelles, sociales et politiques de la d\u00e9cision pour les Premi\u00e8res nations, ainsi que de l\u2019histoire de tradition orale des membres des Premi\u00e8res nations, ce qui peut ne pas aller de pair avec le recours \u00e0 la preuve par affidavit sur laquelle repose la requ\u00eate.\n[44] Dans la m\u00eame veine, je remarque que selon la d\u00e9position de l\u2019affiante de la Couronne, Mme Johnston, le financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC est pass\u00e9 de 193 millions en 1996 \u00e0 523 millions en 2008-2009 en vertu de l\u2019APPP offerte dans cinq provinces, et a tripl\u00e9 au cours de cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Les plaignantes ne semblent pas contester ces chiffres. Elles affirment plut\u00f4t que l\u2019augmentation des fonds vers\u00e9s est insuffisante, que le financement demeure inad\u00e9quat et qu\u2019en outre, certaines provinces veulent avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019APPP mais n\u2019y parviennent pas parce que le MAINC ne la met pas \u00e0 leur disposition.\n(iv) Examen des attentes l\u00e9gitimes des parties \u2013 \u00c9taient-elles en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience viva voce? [45] Les attentes l\u00e9gitimes de la personne qui conteste la d\u00e9cision peuvent \u00e9galement servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 commande de suivre dans une situation donn\u00e9e. Ce facteur soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les plaignantes s\u2019attendaient l\u00e9gitimement \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal se prononce sur le fond de l\u2019affaire exclusivement par voie d\u2019audience viva voce tenant du proc\u00e8s. Sur ce point, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal sont d\u2019une grande pertinence, l\u2019article 3 offrant de multiples possibilit\u00e9s pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de requ\u00eates et la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui des requ\u00eates et en r\u00e9ponse, ainsi qu\u2019une certaine souplesse dans le choix des solutions possibles pour trancher une affaire. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure n\u2019ont peut-\u00eatre pas le statut d\u2019un texte r\u00e9glementaire, mais cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas qu\u2019elles aident les parties et les membres du public \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir quelle proc\u00e9dure le Tribunal est susceptible de suivre (voir Thamotharem c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2007 CAF 198, aux paragraphes 55 et 56 (Thamotharem)). Le fait que les partie n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u de promesse ferme que toutes les questions de fond seraient trait\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une audience formelle sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 50(3) de la Loi constitue un autre facteur pouvant influencer les attentes l\u00e9gitimes des parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[46] La m\u00e9thode de gestion de la pr\u00e9sente affaire adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre moins structur\u00e9e, mais il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9vocablement saisi de l\u2019affaire pour l\u2019application du paragraphe 48.2(2) de la LCDP. D\u00e8s septembre 2009, les parties devaient savoir que son mandat allait bient\u00f4t expirer. En fait, il \u00e9tait int\u00e9rimaire depuis le 1er janvier 2009 (C.P. 2008-1886, Gaz. C. 2009.I.151.). De plus, bien qu\u2019il ait \u00e9bauch\u00e9 le calendrier d\u2019une audience viva voce relativement \u00e0 la plainte, son horaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rigoureusement respect\u00e9 au cours de son mandat. Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance tenue en d\u00e9cembre 2009, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles souhaitaient pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la fa\u00e7on dont je devrais exercer tout pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire me permettant de prolonger le mandat de l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Les parties ont choisi de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[47] Depuis le d\u00e9but de novembre 2009, gr\u00e2ce aux discussions relatives \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019affaire, les parties savaient qu\u2019il existait de fortes chances que le \u00ab mod\u00e8le du proc\u00e8s \u00bb ne soit pas adopt\u00e9 aveugl\u00e9ment en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, en janvier 2010, le Tribunal a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 aux parties des moyens novateurs de parvenir \u00e0 une entente au sujet des questions en litige, des faits et de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve contest\u00e9e avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un autre membre du Tribunal qui aurait agi comme m\u00e9diateur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du processus. Enfin, les plaignantes \u00e9taient au courant que la Couronne entendait soulever ces questions dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en tant que questions pr\u00e9liminaires puisqu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en novembre 2008, une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire. J\u2019examinerai les ordonnances de la protonotaire Aronovitch et la d\u00e9cision rendue en appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces ordonnances dans un autre contexte (lesquelles n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues que le 24 novembre 2009 et le 30 mars 2010 respectivement). Somme toute, il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que le processus soit abr\u00e9g\u00e9 si l\u2019affaire s\u2019y pr\u00eatait. \u00c0 tout le moins, il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une chose impossible \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir.\n(v) Examen du choix de proc\u00e9dure fait par le Tribunal \u2013 La Loi conf\u00e8re-t-elle au pr\u00e9sident le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de choisir la proc\u00e9dure et cette personne a-t-elle une expertise pour prendre cette d\u00e9cision? [48] Finalement, il faut tenir compte des choix de proc\u00e9dure que le Tribunal fait lui-m\u00eame, particuli\u00e8rement quand la Loi lui laisse la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir sa propre proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a une expertise dans le choix de la proc\u00e9dure appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances. En ce qui concerne ce dernier aspect, les membres du Tribunal sont nomm\u00e9s en raison de leurs comp\u00e9tences, de leur exp\u00e9rience et du fait qu\u2019ils sont sensibilis\u00e9s aux droits de la personne (LCDP, paragraphe 48.1(2)). De plus, pour les affaires instruites au moyen d\u2019une audience viva voce, il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que le l\u00e9gislateur a express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux membres le pouvoir de statuer sur toute question de proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019elles soul\u00e8vent (LCDP, alin\u00e9a 50(3)e)). Pour ce qui est du premier aspect, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 discut\u00e9 de ces questions plus haut. Le l\u00e9gislateur a donn\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lui permettant \u00e0 la fois d\u2019\u00e9tablir le cadre proc\u00e9dural applicables aux instances du Tribunal (LCDP, paragraphe 48.9(2)) et de d\u00e9finir d\u2019autres aspects de la proc\u00e9dure applicable \u00e0 l\u2019instruction (LCDP, paragraphes 49(2) et (3)). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait d\u2019examiner la requ\u00eate de la Couronne serait une bonne illustration de la politique adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal en mati\u00e8re d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice, en vue de la r\u00e9alisation du double objectif de r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts (frais juridiques et co\u00fbts sur le plan \u00e9motif) assum\u00e9s par les parties et de r\u00e8glement acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 \u2013 mais n\u00e9anmoins comp\u00e9tent et \u00e9quitable \u2013 des affaires.\nConclusion \u2013 il est conforme aux principes de justice naturelle d\u2019entendre les arguments formul\u00e9s par la Couronne dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate\n[49] L\u2019examen sommaire des cinq facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion suivante : bien que l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 (et par cons\u00e9quent, les principes de justice naturelle) commande de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen des questions en jeu qui aille au del\u00e0 d\u2019une r\u00e9vision administrative ou d\u2019une instruction sur dossier \u00bb, les garanties proc\u00e9durales n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre identiques \u00e0 celles qui ont cours dans un proc\u00e8s formel. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont pu d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire, des affidavits et les transcriptions des contre\u2011interrogatoires des affiants et elles ont eu la pleine possibilit\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal pour pr\u00e9senter des arguments de vive voix. Le dossier du Tribunal pour cette seule requ\u00eate contient plus de 10 000 pages. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les parties ont sollicit\u00e9 d\u2019autres permissions de d\u00e9poser de la jurisprudence et des observations aff\u00e9rentes, permissions qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es. Du point de vue du paragraphe 48.9 (1) de la Loi, je crois que la proc\u00e9dure sommaire relativement informelle et exp\u00e9ditive choisie par la Couronne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne contrevient pas aux r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Toutes les parties ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Couronne.\n[50] Par ailleurs, le fait de r\u00e9gler certaines questions par voie de requ\u00eate est conforme au mandat confi\u00e9 de longue date aux tribunaux administratifs, dont le Tribunal, lesquels doivent continuellement tendre vers un r\u00e8glement exp\u00e9ditif, \u00e9quitable et \u00e9clair\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rends (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 941; Douglas\/Kwantlen Faculty Assn. c. Douglas College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570).\n[51] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 craintes exprim\u00e9es par les Chefs concernant la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019audience soit fragment\u00e9e, mentionnons que les affaires faisant intervenir des questions de droit claires sont relativement rares et qu\u2019en outre, l\u2019argument repose sur la supposition que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sera renvers\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une instance judiciaire subs\u00e9quente. Les avantages li\u00e9s au fait de statuer clairement et rapidement sur les questions essentielles l\u2019emportent sur les risques hypoth\u00e9tiques de cet ordre.\n[52] Dans l\u2019ensemble, l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate de la Couronne dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire facilite l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice au lieu d\u2019y faire obstacle. Cela permet aux parties de d\u00e9terminer o\u00f9 et comment utiliser au mieux leurs ressources et aussi si d\u2019autres voies de recours, par exemple une contestation constitutionnelle, sont \u00e0 m\u00eame de mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9occupations. Cela emp\u00eache \u00e9galement que des attentes irr\u00e9alistes se forment. L\u2019objectif est de r\u00e9gler les objections fondamentales de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e avant que les parties ne consacrent d\u2019importantes ressources aux audiences viva voce, qui peuvent durer des ann\u00e9es. En fait, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9primand\u00e9 le Tribunal pour sa mauvaise gestion d\u2019une audience, ce qui avait permis \u00e0 une affaire complexe d\u2019absorber une quantit\u00e9 exceptionnelle de temps et de ressources (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Dans cette affaire, le juge des requ\u00eates avait fait l\u2019observation suivante : \u00ab Une audience sans discipline ni \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers retarde la justice et constitue un d\u00e9ni de justice \u00bb.(Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 145.) \u00c0 mon sens, compte tenu de sa large port\u00e9e, la pr\u00e9sente plainte exigeait et continue d\u2019exiger une gestion serr\u00e9e. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019ai mis \u00e0 la disposition des parties un outil novateur, un processus de m\u00e9diation dans le cadre duquel j\u2019ai nomm\u00e9 un membre du Tribunal, en janvier 2010, pour qu\u2019il travaille avec elles \u00e0 mieux circonscrire les questions en litige. J\u2019estime que la responsabilit\u00e9 incombe au Tribunal de faire une gestion dynamique de son processus d\u2019instruction \u00e0 compter de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019affaire renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement soit conclu ou qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue, en utilisant tous les outils administratifs \u00e0 sa disposition. Cela peut consister \u00e0 collaborer avec les avocats et les parties afin de mieux circonscrire les questions de droit et de fait qui sont v\u00e9ritablement en litige avant la tenue d\u2019une audience et d\u2019examiner et de trancher les questions qui peuvent l\u2019\u00eatre de mani\u00e8re efficace et \u00e9quitable avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te de vive voix. En ce sens, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce cadre l\u00e9gislatif unique, le Tribunal dispose de moyens plus souples que les cours de justice pour g\u00e9rer son processus, et j\u2019ajouterais qu\u2019il a aussi une responsabilit\u00e9 plus grande \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En tant que tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, il peut rep\u00e9rer les questions d\u2019acc\u00e8s propres \u00e0 son domaine d\u2019expertise, par exemple en ce qui a trait aux co\u00fbts et aux d\u00e9lais, et devrait le faire. C\u2019est la raison d\u2019\u00eatre des tribunaux administratifs que de concevoir des solutions uniques pour am\u00e9liorer l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice, solutions dont les seules limites sont l\u2019imagination et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par les param\u00e8tres \u00e9tablis dans sa loi habilitante.\n[53] La Loi n\u2019oblige pas le Tribunal \u00e0 tenir une audience viva voce dans tous les cas. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsque les faits pertinents ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et lorsque les questions \u00e0 trancher sont de pur droit. Un processus de cet ordre ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\nV. AUTRES ARGUMENTS SOULEV\u00c9S PAR LES PARTIES EN R\u00c9PONSE \u00c0 LA QUESTION DE SAVOIR SI L\u2019INSTRUCTION DE LA REQU\u00caTE EST UN CADRE AD\u00c9QUAT A. La Couronne soutient que la plainte soul\u00e8ve une question v\u00e9ritable de comp\u00e9tence qui devrait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate [54] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Couronne indique qu\u2019elle demande le rejet de la plainte pour d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170 (Watkin), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que les actes reproch\u00e9s sont ou non des \u00ab services \u00bb, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00ab question touchant v\u00e9ritablement \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence ou \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[55] Il est vrai que, depuis longtemps, la jurisprudence t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une tentative de rep\u00e9rer et d\u2019isoler les questions pr\u00e9liminaires qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es avant la tenue de l\u2019audience viva voce, parce que ces questions d\u00e9terminent la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019instruire une affaire (voir Bell c. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1971] R.C.S. 756, p. 775; Union des employ\u00e9s de service, local 298 c. Bibeault, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 1048, au paragraphe 110 (Bibeault)). Toutefois, cette tendance est renvers\u00e9e depuis un certain temps d\u00e9j\u00e0 (voir Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section locale 963 c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Nouveau-Brunswick, [1979] 2 R.C.S. 227; Bibeault, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 111 \u00e0 126). Ainsi que l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador dans Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) c. Newfoundland (Health) (1998), 164 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 251, 31 C.H.R.R. 405, et 13 Admin. L.R. (3d) 142 (Prior), toutes les questions de comp\u00e9tence ne se pr\u00eatent pas \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire :\n[traduction]\n[17] Je souscris aux propos du juge Hoyt dans New Brunswick (Board of Management) et al. v. New Brunswick Council of Hospital Unions et al. reflex, (1986), 77 N.B.R. (2d) 392; 195 A.P.R. 392; 35 D.L.R. (4th) 282 (C.A.), qui conclut, \u00e0 la p. 286 : \u00ab [L]a d\u00e9cision d\u2019examiner la question pr\u00e9liminaire de comp\u00e9tence au stade initial doit, \u00e0 mon sens, \u00eatre prise par le pr\u00e9sident dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice r\u00e9gulier de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00bb\n[56] La Cour d\u2019appel remarque ensuite, au paragraphe 21, qu\u2019un tribunal peut choisir d\u2019entendre une demande visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur un point de droit mais qu\u2019en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, cela se produira si les parties s\u2019entendent sur les faits. En outre, si le Tribunal peut recevoir des affidavits et des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix et en tirer des conclusions de fait, il n\u2019est pas pratique de le faire [traduction] \u00ab [l]orsque les questions de fait et de droit sont complexes et entrem\u00eal\u00e9es. Dans un tel cas, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, pour des raisons d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, d\u2019attendre la tenue de l\u2019audience compl\u00e8te avant de se prononcer sur la question \"pr\u00e9liminaire\". \u00bb (Prior, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 21, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait de dire que les motifs sur lesquels se fonde la requ\u00eate de la Couronne sont \u00ab d\u2019ordre juridictionnel \u00bb ou \u00ab touchent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence \u00bb n\u2019aide pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019examiner les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate. En ce qui concerne les questions pr\u00e9liminaires relatives \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019id\u00e9e de revenir \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la comp\u00e9tence ou de la condition pr\u00e9alable qui, dans ce domaine, a pes\u00e9 sur la jurisprudence pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es \u00bb. (Dunsmuir, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 59).\nB. La Couronne soutient que la plainte soul\u00e8ve une question d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure qui peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate [58] La question de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure se pr\u00eate elle aussi \u00e0 un traitement appropri\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate. Toutefois, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la Couronne voulant que le fait de faire valoir une cause d\u2019action outrepassant la comp\u00e9tence d\u00e9cisionnelle de la Cour constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La Couronne invoque l\u2019affaire Weider c. Beco Industries Ltd., [1976] 2 C.F. 739 (Weider) \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa proposition. Partant, la Couronne pr\u00e9tend que le fait de d\u00e9poser une plainte qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal constitue un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et emporte la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un rejet sommaire. Je ne suis pas certain qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Weider, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Deuxi\u00e8mement, je ne sais pas r\u00e9ellement de quelle fa\u00e7on cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 tir\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Weider, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, serait formul\u00e9 de nos jours compte tenu de l\u2019abondance de la jurisprudence subs\u00e9quente s\u2019int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 ce qui constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure (voir Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63, aux paragraphes 35 et 36). Troisi\u00e8mement, les questions d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure qui, selon ce qu\u2019a conclu la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, pourraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire ne ressemblent aucunement \u00e0 l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e par la Couronne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui all\u00e8gue un \u00ab abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb de nature juridictionnelle. Enfin, compte tenu que j\u2019ai affirm\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement que les questions touchant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence ne se pr\u00eataient pas automatiquement \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire, je ne puis accepter que la d\u00e9cision Weider, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, fait autorit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne l\u2019argument voulant que la requ\u00eate de la Couronne, ind\u00e9pendamment de son caract\u00e8re technique ou complexe ou des difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pose sur le plan factuel, peut n\u00e9anmoins \u2014sans autre analyse \u2014 faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sommaire en marge d\u2019une audience formelle.\n[59] Cela dit, le groupe des plaignantes pr\u00e9tend, quant \u00e0 lui, que le rejet pr\u00e9liminaire d\u2019une plainte est indiqu\u00e9 uniquement dans les cas comme celui qu\u2019a examin\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Harkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2009 TCDP 6 (Harkin). Dans cette affaire, le membre a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, limitait le pouvoir du Tribunal d\u2019entendre des requ\u00eates en rejet sommaire \u00e0 celles mettant en cause un manquement aux principes de justice naturelle, comme les retards et l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, ou des questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9es et r\u00e9gl\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement dans un autre forum. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 on pr\u00e9tend que Harkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, \u00e9tablit une liste exhaustive des sc\u00e9narios o\u00f9 le rejet sommaire est permis, je ne puis, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, \u00eatre d\u2019accord. Bien que le Tribunal, dans cette affaire, limite la port\u00e9e de Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux faits en cause, il s\u2019abstient d\u2019examiner express\u00e9ment le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi (\u00ab sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive \u00bb). De plus, j\u2019estime que Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ne dresse pas en soi une liste exhaustive des sc\u00e9narios permettant le rejet sommaire. Au contraire, \u00e0 un certain moment, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale traite en termes relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la question consistant \u00e0 donner suite \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires afin de d\u00e9broussailler la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 14). Ainsi que je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je crois que l\u2019approche la plus sens\u00e9e et la plus pratique pour le Tribunal consiste simplement \u00e0 examiner le dossier de la requ\u00eate question par question et de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il adh\u00e8re aux directives donn\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur aux paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi.\nC. Les plaignantes pr\u00e9tendent que le crit\u00e8re applicable est celui du \u00ab caract\u00e8re manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb d\u00e9fini par les cours de justice et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas la proc\u00e9dure appropri\u00e9e [60] Les plaignantes semblent accepter l\u2019id\u00e9e que le Tribunal puisse rejeter une plainte de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire lorsqu\u2019il est \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb qu\u2019elle est vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec. Ce crit\u00e8re juridique semble tirer son origine de la jurisprudence r\u00e9gie par les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile qui autorisent la radiation d\u2019une plainte qui ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune cause d\u2019action valable (Hunt c. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 R.C.S. 959). J\u2019adh\u00e8re aux propos de la Couronne, qui avance qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 d\u2019importer dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif de la LCDP des crit\u00e8res appliqu\u00e9s par les tribunaux civils, dont les fondations juridiques sont fort diff\u00e9rentes.\n[61] J\u2019ajouterais en passant que le Tribunal applique le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab caract\u00e8re manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir une requ\u00eate en modification d\u2019une plainte (voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 6 et 7; Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 13, au paragraphe 4). Toutefois, ce crit\u00e8re n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au contr\u00f4le d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal autorisant ainsi la modification d\u2019une plainte (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313).\n[62] Pour revenir au crit\u00e8re, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il signifie que s\u2019il est possible de r\u00e9pondre compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 l\u2019objection dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate \u00e0 partir du dossier aff\u00e9rent et sans avoir \u00e0 tenir une audience compl\u00e8te viva voce, la requ\u00eate sera tranch\u00e9e ainsi. Je conclus que la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 traiter des objections de la Couronne \u00e0 ce stade-ci dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en d\u00e9terminant \u2014question par question\u2014 si l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate constitue un cadre suffisant pour donner effet au droit des parties de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments et en particulier, leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, comme le pr\u00e9voit la Loi.\nD. Les plaignantes soutiennent que, selon la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Tribunal est tenu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience viva voce [63] Les plaignantes soutiennent que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une audience viva voce de la plainte en cause et que cette ordonnance m\u2019oblige \u00e0 ordonner cette audience. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. La Couronne a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire. Les plaignantes ont sollicit\u00e9, par voie de requ\u00eate, la radiation de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, un sursis \u00e0 la demande de la Couronne jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la conclusion de l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal. La Cour a refus\u00e9 de radier la demande de la Couronne au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une mesure d\u2019exception qui n\u2019est accord\u00e9e que dans les cas les plus flagrants (David Bull Laboratories (Can) Inc. c. Pharmacie Inc., [1995] 1 C.F. 588). Concernant le sursis, la protonotaire Aronovitch a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311 et a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de sursis des plaignantes. Sur l\u2019existence d\u2019une question s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 trancher, elle a \u00e9crit que la plainte, \u00e9tant s\u00e9rieuse et complexe, ne devrait pas \u00eatre jug\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on sommaire et en l\u2019absence du dossier factuel n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation globale des questions en cause. Deuxi\u00e8mement, apr\u00e8s avoir soupes\u00e9 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, elle a \u00e9crit que le fait de permettre l\u2019examen complet et minutieux par un Tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 de questions susceptibles d\u2019influencer la capacit\u00e9 future des Autochtones de former des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de discrimination comportait un int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n[64] J\u2019estime que ces commentaires ne d\u00e9rogent pas aux directives \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi et ne restreignent aucunement l\u2019obligation du Tribunal d\u2019instruire la requ\u00eate de la Couronne et de d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure indiqu\u00e9e dans les circonstances, \u00e0 partir du dossier de preuve dont il est saisi. Le fait pour le Tribunal d\u2019exercer \u00e0 nouveau son mandat en donnant suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en rejet ne constitue pas non plus un contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire puisque ce mandat est pr\u00e9vu dans la LCDP. En fait, comme nous l\u2019avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le cadre d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate constitue un forum l\u00e9gitime d\u2019instruction dans les cas indiqu\u00e9s (voir Cremasco, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Enfin, je note au passage que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pour effet de remettre \u00e0 plus tard l\u2019instruction de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Couronne concernant la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la conclusion de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal.\nE. La Couronne soutient que les plaignantes ont le fardeau de d\u00e9poser la preuve requise [65] Finalement, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, un double fardeau de preuve est impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante, la Couronne, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Dans ses observations, la Couronne avance que le fardeau incombe plut\u00f4t aux plaignantes, qui doivent \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la Couronne de demander aux plaignantes, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, de \u00ab [\u2026] sortir un atout sinon [elles] risque[nt] de perdre \u00bb (Goudie c. Ottawa (Ville), 2003 CSC 14, au paragraphe 32), et je note que la Couronne elle-m\u00eame est d\u2019avis que la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de jugement sommaire est aussi inapplicable dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente motion que celle portant sur les requ\u00eates en radiation pour cause d\u2019action inexistante. Autrement dit, les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler en entier leur dossier de preuve en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une requ\u00eate par crainte de provoquer le rejet de cette plainte pour manque de preuve. Lorsqu\u2019un plaignant se voit imposer le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, cela survient dans le cadre d\u2019une audience formelle de la nature du proc\u00e8s et non lors de l\u2019instruction d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la personne accus\u00e9e de discrimination. Dans ses observations sur la proc\u00e9dure, les plaignantes sont libres d\u2019expliquer pourquoi la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 aux parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb, notamment, de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Si la partie requ\u00e9rante ne s\u2019acquitte pas de son fardeau en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure et si le Tribunal accepte les arguments des plaignantes selon lesquels le cadre d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate ne peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs besoins en mati\u00e8re de preuve, on ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles puissent pr\u00e9senter une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Cela serait impossible \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser, sur le plan logistique ou proc\u00e9dural, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du cadre d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate. Dans ce contexte, il appartient \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante qui fait valoir un recours particulier aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, l\u2019ordonnance de rejet sommaire) de convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019elle y a droit. Pour ces motifs, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il serait contraire aux prescriptions de la Loi et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de proc\u00e9der au renversement du fardeau de la preuve.\nVI. EXAMEN DE LA QUESTION DES SERVICES DANS LE CADRE DE L\u2019INSTRUCTION D\u2019UNE REQU\u00caTE \u2013 LES FAITS PERTINENTS SONT-ILS CLAIRS, COMPLETS ET NON CONTEST\u00c9S A. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des positions des parties [66] J\u2019examinerai maintenant l\u2019argument de la Couronne selon lequel le Tribunal devrait rejeter la plainte sommairement au motif que le versement de fonds par l\u2019entremise du Programme des SEFPN ne constitue pas un service. La Couronne affirme que la plainte ne traite pas ad\u00e9quatement de la relation entre le MAINC, les entit\u00e9s qui re\u00e7oivent du financement en vertu du Programme des SEFPN et la responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ont d\u2019assurer la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance aux enfants inscrits des Premi\u00e8res nations qui vivent habituellement dans des r\u00e9serves; par cons\u00e9quent, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une plainte de discrimination reconnue par la loi. Pour r\u00e9sumer, elle pr\u00e9tend que les fournisseurs de services en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du financement accord\u00e9 dans le cadre du programme : personnes morales diverses, bandes, conseils tribaux et gouvernements. Ce sont ces organisations qui offrent de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves; le MAINC ne fournit pas d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 qui que ce soit.\n[67] La Couronne pr\u00e9tend aussi que les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de financement ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux et que la politique du MAINC dans ce domaine est le reflet d\u2019une politique relevant purement du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif qui ne peut \u00eatre invalid\u00e9e en vertu de la LCDP. En revanche, la Couronne conc\u00e8de que les tribunaux ont jug\u00e9 que le financement public \u00e9tait un service lorsque le r\u00f4le du gouvernement d\u00e9passait le simple versement de fonds pour inclure des obligations importantes se rapportant sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 la prestation du service m\u00eame (arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, p. 712, paragraphe 66).\n[68] La d\u00e9cision rendue r\u00e9cemment par la Cour supr\u00eame dans le cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, confirme la position de la Couronne voulant que l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative des provinces. La Couronne fait valoir que l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance n\u2019est pas une \u00ab question \u00bb tombant sous le coup de l\u2019article 91 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, mais qu\u2019elle rel\u00e8ve enti\u00e8rement de l\u2019article 92. De plus, la Couronne pr\u00e9tend que les activit\u00e9s habituelles des organisations d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ne sont pas reli\u00e9es aux questions de droits et de statut des Indiens figurant au paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. En faisant une analogie avec les questions de relations de travail examin\u00e9es dans NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Couronne \u00e9taye sa position selon laquelle l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est une question provinciale. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une position adopt\u00e9e tant par la majorit\u00e9 que par la minorit\u00e9 dans NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Le financement des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance aux Indiens dans les r\u00e9serves est une question enti\u00e8rement li\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime provincial et ne peut servir de fondement \u00e0 une plainte devant le Tribunal des droits de la personne.\n[69] Toutefois, les plaignantes r\u00e9futent cette position en soumettant que, par ses actes, le MAINC d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il exerce \u00e0 tous le moins un certain contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, notamment en finan\u00e7ant les salaires et le fonctionnement des organisations, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 des v\u00e9rifications de la conformit\u00e9 et en passant en revue les dossiers des enfants plac\u00e9s. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la Couronne, qui pr\u00e9tend que ces actes ne sont que des mesures de v\u00e9rification, les plaignantes font valoir qu\u2019il faut plut\u00f4t consid\u00e9rer ces mesures dans leur contexte et sous un angle global compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits dans le cadre de l\u2019audience viva voce. Elles ajoutent que le programme de financement d\u00e9montre qu\u2019en d\u00e9finitive, c\u2019est le MAINC qui d\u00e9cide du type et du niveau d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Selon elles, il est impossible de traiter de la relation entre le MAINC et les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires finaux de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, les enfants et familles des Premi\u00e8res nations, en l\u2019absence des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une audience viva voce. Elles affirment que le MAINC est de facto fournisseur de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, ou fournisseur conjoint de ces services. Les Chefs soutiennent que selon l\u2019Entente de 1965, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est responsable de la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le MAINC n\u2019est pas un \u00ab spectateur \u00bb (Arguments des Chefs de l\u2019Ontario, p. 4, paragraphe 9).\n[70] Concernant l\u2019arr\u00eat NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, les plaignantes r\u00e9pondent que la d\u00e9cision ne s\u2019applique pas et qu\u2019il faut \u00e9tablir une distinction entre elle et les circonstances en cause ici. Elles affirment que la d\u00e9cision traite exclusivement de la question de comp\u00e9tence dans les relations de travail et qu\u2019elle n\u2019aborde pas les questions des services et de la pertinence d\u2019un groupe de comparaison. Les plaignantes pr\u00e9tendent que la participation du MAINC aux services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves correspond \u00e0 un exercice, sur le plan administratif, du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, ou sinon, du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de d\u00e9penser. Pour cette raison, les plaignantes affirment que c\u2019est le Canada, et non les provinces, qui d\u00e9cident quels services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance sont offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves.\nB. Que dit le droit en mati\u00e8re de \u00ab services \u00bb? [71] Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les mesures vis\u00e9es par la plainte sont des \u00ab services \u00bb (voir Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 571, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 60 (Gould); et, Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). La notion de \u00ab services \u00bb fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u00ab offert \u00bb ou \u00ab mis \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb du public. Par cons\u00e9quent, les mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi ne sont pas des services parce qu\u2019elles ne sont pas \u00ab mises \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb ou \u00ab offertes \u00bb au public et qu\u2019elles ne s\u2019inscrivent pas \u00ab dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique \u00bb (Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 31; et Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 16, 55 et 60). La mesure prise dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public ne devient pas un \u00ab service \u00bb pour cette seule raison (Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 22). Les services n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019ensemble des membres du grand public pour \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb (Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin, 1991 1 C.F. 391 (Rosin); et, Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique c. Berg, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 353 (Berg)).\n[72] La plupart des services offerts par les gouvernements sont accessibles au public. En fait, on pourrait tr\u00e8s bien affirmer que pratiquement tout ce que fait le gouvernement est destin\u00e9 au public, mis \u00e0 la disposition du public et accessible au public (Rosin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 8 et 11). Le Tribunal a conclu que le MAINC fournissait un service en interc\u00e9dant en faveur des occupants d\u2019une terre de r\u00e9serve pour n\u00e9gocier un bail avec d\u2019\u00e9ventuels locataires (Louie and Beattie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 44 \u00e0 49, en attente de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, dossier no T-325-11).\n[73] Il incombe au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si les actes vis\u00e9s par la plainte peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un service : \u00e0 savoir, si les actions du gouvernement qui ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend habituellement peuvent n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des \u00ab services \u00bb pour l\u2019application de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi (Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 25). Dans Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que les mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des \u00ab services \u00bb.\n[74] La question de savoir si le financement accord\u00e9 par le gouvernement constitue un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de la LCDP n\u2019est pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. On trouve certains principes utiles dans la jurisprudence d\u2019autres territoires dont les lois relatives aux droits de la personne traitent elles aussi de discrimination dans la prestation d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb ou de plusieurs \u00ab services \u00bb. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la relation ou les relations entre le fournisseur de services pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des services doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer si des modalit\u00e9s ou conditions sont ou non impos\u00e9es en \u00e9change du financement, comme le pouvoir d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur la teneur du service (voir Bitonti c. British Columbia, [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No 60, aux paragraphes 314 et 315 (Bitonti), et Donna Martyn c. Laidlaw Transit Ltd. o\/a Yellow Cab Ltd., Alberta Co-op taxi Line LTD., Edmonton taxi commission, City of Edmonton, Alberta transportation (2005), 55 C.H.R.R. D\/235 (Alta. H.R.P.), aux paragraphes 356 \u00e0 369 (Martyn)). Par exemple, dans HMTQ c. Moore et al, 2001 BCSC 336, aux paragraphes 19 \u00e0 26 (Moore), le ministre pouvait, en marge du versement des fonds, prendre des arr\u00eat\u00e9s : a) r\u00e9gissant la prestation des programmes \u00e9ducatifs; b) fixer les exigences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019obtention d\u2019un dipl\u00f4me; c) d\u00e9finir la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d\u2019\u00e9ducation dispens\u00e9s dans les \u00e9coles; et d) \u00e9laborer un processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des programmes \u00e9ducatifs. La Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019objet des all\u00e9gations de discrimination contre le minist\u00e8re ne devait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9 \u00e0 un usage \u00e0 bon ou mauvais escient de son pouvoir de financement.\n[75] Les attributions du gouvernement qui accorde du financement sont pertinentes (Moore, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Dans la d\u00e9cision Moore, le minist\u00e8re en cause disposait du pouvoir de dire aux conseils scolaires de consacrer certaines sommes \u00e0 la prestation de programmes aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ayant des besoins particuliers (voir le paragraphe 22). En revanche, le fait qu\u2019un gouvernement provincial, par exemple, (i) n\u2019exerce pas de surveillance sur le syst\u00e8me de services, (ii) ne soit pas tenu par la loi de r\u00e9glementer ce domaine et (iii) ait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 son pouvoir de r\u00e9glementation dans le domaine \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9, peuvent constituer des indices que ce gouvernement n\u2019est pas un fournisseur de services (Martyn, supra).\nC. Analyse \u2013 fond\u00e9e sur les faits [76] La preuve produite dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas constitu\u00e9e de faits clairs, complets et non contest\u00e9s. Le dossier de la requ\u00eate ne me permet pas de d\u00e9cider si le r\u00e9gime complexe de financement du MAINC peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00ab service \u00bb pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. Il est fait \u00e9tat de quelques-unes des lacunes de la preuve dans les paragraphes qui suivent.\nLes fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations re\u00e7oivent des fonds mais ne sont pas les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance\n[77] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nul ne conteste que les fonds vers\u00e9 par le MAINC sont \u00ab offerts \u00bb ou \u00ab mis \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb du public. L\u2019un des aspects importants du diff\u00e9rend s\u2019articule plut\u00f4t autour des points de vue divergents des parties au sujet de ce qu\u2019il faut entendre par \u00ab public \u00bb. En tant que b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires directs des fonds vers\u00e9s par le MAINC, les fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations sont-ils ce \u00ab public \u00bb? Ou s\u2019agit-il plut\u00f4t des enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations? La Couronne fait valoir que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ultimes de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ne sont pas les fournisseurs de services. Elle ajoute qu\u2019il y a un cha\u00eenon manquant en ce sens que le MAINC ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable des enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations, qui sont les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Pour les raisons mentionn\u00e9es, je ne puis accepter que cet argument puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9terminant pour la question en litige. Il n\u2019est pas inconcevable que la LCDP puisse permettre de lever le voile derri\u00e8re lequel se cache le fournisseur de services afin de comprendre la nature r\u00e9elle de la relation entre le MAINC et les enfants et familles des Premi\u00e8res nations.\n[78] Cependant, le n\u0153ud du diff\u00e9rend porte plut\u00f4t sur le fait de savoir si le MAINC a le pouvoir de donner aux fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations des directives quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de fournir les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et s\u2019il le fait au moyen de modalit\u00e9s et de conditions rattach\u00e9es aux programmes de financement. En revanche, si le MAINC n\u2019a aucun r\u00f4le de surveillance relativement \u00e0 l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et que ce r\u00f4le est exerc\u00e9 exclusivement par les provinces, on ne peut consid\u00e9rer que le MAINC fournit un \u00ab service \u00bb.\n[79] Le pouvoir de faire des lois relativement aux \u00ab Indiens \u00bb et aux terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les \u00ab Indiens \u00bb appartient au Parlement. Le pouvoir de faire des lois en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pour l\u2019ensemble des enfants d\u2019une province appartient \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature de la province. La preuve produite dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate n\u2019indique pas de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise :\n1. les modalit\u00e9s et conditions dont est assorti le financement dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime de financement complexe du MAINC ni si le MAINC exerce un contr\u00f4le et (ou) assure la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans quelque domaine distinct au moyen de ces modalit\u00e9s et conditions;\n2. si le MAINC d\u00e9finit la teneur de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, par exemple, s\u2019il dicte le genre d\u2019interventions offertes aux enfants et aux familles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019entretien;\n3. si le MAINC exerce un r\u00f4le de surveillance sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et s\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 des \u00e9valuations des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance au moyen de mesures telles que la v\u00e9rification et les examens de nature administrative.\n(i) La Couronne n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les faits pertinents \u00e9taient clairs, complets et non contest\u00e9s [80] M\u00eame si la Couronne a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9cision portant que le financement n\u2019est pas un service, elle n\u2019a pas produit la preuve dont j\u2019ai besoin pour trancher la question.\n[81] De plus, bien que les parties aient produit quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, elles ne s\u2019entendent pas sur les faits pertinents ni sur les conclusions que ces faits permettent de tirer.\n[82] Dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a rendu relativement au renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, la Commission d\u00e9clare que [traduction] \u00ab compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, il est manifeste qu\u2019une instruction est n\u00e9cessaire et qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate ne serait vraisemblablement pas un moyen efficace ou efficient, sur le plan administratif, d\u2019examiner les all\u00e9gations de violation des droits de la personne et de tirer des conclusions car les principaux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sont de nature juridique et non factuelle et ne d\u00e9coulent d\u2019aucun principe juridique \u00e9tabli \u00bb [(First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and Assembly of First Nations c. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, d\u00e9cision 20061060 de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 30 septembre 2008). Je note que les arguments soumis par la Commission dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate ne sont pas les m\u00eames que ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans sa d\u00e9cision relative au renvoi. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le Tribunal a invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits pour pouvoir proc\u00e9der rapidement \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 un autre membre du Tribunal afin de les aider \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur les faits importants, et ce, m\u00eame si elles ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elles faisaient circuler un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits en d\u00e9cembre 2009 et qu\u2019elles avaient continu\u00e9 \u00e0 y travailler avec l\u2019aide du m\u00e9diateur. En mars 2010, plusieurs parties ont subitement choisi de cesser le travail entrepris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Or, l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits m\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile pour comprendre le fondement factuel de l\u2019affaire et pour statuer sur la question soulev\u00e9e dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate.\n[83] La Couronne a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit de huit pages et son dossier de requ\u00eate, qui comporte quelque 690 pages. L\u2019unique affiante de la Couronne, Mme Johnston, n\u2019a pas pris directement et personnellement part \u00e0 la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerte par le fournisseur de services d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation. Je remarque que la liste des t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s par la Couronne comprend des personnes qui semblent \u00eatre en mesure de livrer un t\u00e9moignage utile dans le cadre d\u2019une audience viva voce compl\u00e8te : des membres du personnel du MAINC, y compris des conseillers principaux en mati\u00e8re de politiques pour ce qui est de l\u2019acheminement des fonds aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, des gestionnaires pour ce qui est des ententes ou des dispositions particuli\u00e8res applicables dans certaines provinces et des protocoles d\u2019entente et des calculs des taux d\u2019entretien et des remboursements, des directeurs r\u00e9gionaux int\u00e9rimaires pour des mod\u00e8les provinciaux particuliers, et des sp\u00e9cialistes des op\u00e9rations. La Couronne devrait d\u00e9poser un tableau du financement (rapport du processus de m\u00e9diation no 2, 30 juin 2010, au paragraphe 2). Toutefois, elle ne l\u2019a pas fait aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n1. Ententes de financement complexes \u2013 non d\u00e9pos\u00e9es [84] Le MAINC accorde du financement \u00e0 108 fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations afin qu\u2019ils dispensent des services de cet ordre \u00e0 quelque 160 000 enfants et adolescents au sein d\u2019environ 447 des 663 Premi\u00e8res nations (contre-interrogatoire de Mme Cindy Blackstock, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 7, aux pages 337 et 338). Toutefois, le financement prend diverses formes d\u2019une province \u00e0 l\u2019autre et au Yukon. Par exemple, au Yukon, le MAINC verse des fonds au gouvernement yukonais afin qu\u2019il dispense de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 tous les enfants indiens vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serve. La Couronne n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 chaque entente pertinente. Une seule entente de financement intervenue avec un organisme de financement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate. Comme je l\u2019ai signal\u00e9, la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la pr\u00e9sente plainte vont au del\u00e0 de toute plainte dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie \u00e0 ce jour et porte sur le financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada, ce qui vise, au minimum, entre 50 \u00e0 60 ententes de financement sous le r\u00e9gime de la seule Directive 20-1.\n2. Des t\u00e9moins sont requis pour clarifier le contenu de l\u2019entente de financement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et de celles qui doivent l\u2019\u00eatre [85] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le Manuel national du Programme (MNP) qui renferme la Directive 20-1. Cette directive d\u00e9crit les r\u00e9gimes de financement applicables en Colombie\u2011Britannique, au Manitoba, \u00e0 Terre-Neuve, au Nouveau-Brunswick et au Yukon. Le MNP est truff\u00e9 de dispositions qui ne sont pas claires \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue pour le Tribunal et que le reste du dossier ne permet pas de clarifier : la partie des Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux renvoie au principal objectif du programme, qui est d\u2019offrir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00ab adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture \u00bb aux enfants indiens et \u00e0 leurs familles qui vivent ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve, dans \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment aux lois et aux normes provinciales (Manuel national du Programme, Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, clause 1.3.2, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 3B). La politique constitue une \u00e9tape int\u00e9rimaire en attendant que les Premi\u00e8res nations \u00ab parviennent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale \u00bb (Manuel national du Programme, Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, clause 1.3.3, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 3B). Les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts par les fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations dans les r\u00e9serves doivent \u00eatre \u00ab adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture et \u00eatre comparables \u00bb mais pas \u00ab n\u00e9cessairement identiques \u00bb \u00e0 ceux offerts par les provinces \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves dans des \u00ab conditions semblables \u00bb (Manuel national du Programme, Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, clause 1.3.5, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 3B). La preuve et les observations de la Couronne ne pr\u00e9cisent pas le contenu des obligations pr\u00e9vues dans les diverses lois provinciales, notamment en ce qui concerne les services \u00ab adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture \u00bb des enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations. Il est donc pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de trancher les questions du contr\u00f4le et de la teneur des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[86] La structure de financement relative \u00e0 la seule Directive 20-1 est complexe et fait intervenir un bon nombre d\u2019ententes de financement et de protocoles d\u2019ententes. La seule entente produite dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en lien avec la Directive 20-1 est un mod\u00e8le d\u2019entente globale de financement utilis\u00e9e au Manitoba et intervenue entre le MAINC et la Southeast Child and Family Services Inc. (l\u2019Entente globale de financement); elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les plaignantes. Le MAINC verse pr\u00e8s de dix-sept millions de dollars \u00e0 cet organisme pour la prestation d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 dix Premi\u00e8res nations du Manitoba, y compris celles de Bloodvein et de Buffalo Point.\n[87] Dans l\u2019affidavit qu\u2019elle a souscrit pour le compte de la Couronne, Mme Johnston indique qui assure la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans chacune des quatre provinces et dans l\u2019unique territoire concern\u00e9s par la Directive 20-1 (Affidavit de Mme Odette Johnston, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 2, au paragraphe 15). D\u2019apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9position, on peut conclure qu\u2019\u00e0 Terre-Neuve, le financement pourrait faire intervenir deux ententes du MAINC et trois ententes du gouvernement provincial; au Nouveau-Brunswick, deux ententes du MAINC et quatorze ententes du gouvernement provincial; au Manitoba, quatorze ententes du MAINC; en Colombie-Britannique, vingt et une ententes du MAINC et des ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale; au Yukon, une seule entente. De m\u00eame, je remarque que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019affidavit de Mme Johnston, en Saskatchewan, m\u00eame si le financement est essentiellement r\u00e9gi par une AAAP, deux organismes sont encore parties \u00e0 une entente r\u00e9gie par la Directive 20-1. Le sigle AAAP d\u00e9signe l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention que le MAINC a substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 la Directive 20-1 et dont la mise en \u0153uvre a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e pour l\u2019Alberta en 2007. Depuis sa mise en \u0153uvre, quatre autres provinces ont aussi accept\u00e9 de passer de la Directive 20-1 \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP. Or, l\u2019AAAP et les ententes aff\u00e9rentes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites. En Ontario, l\u2019Entente de 1965 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre reprises. Ainsi, l\u2019examen du dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que possiblement 60 ententes se rapportant \u00e0 la Directive 20-1 pourraient \u00eatre concern\u00e9es. Ce nombre est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour l\u2019AAAP. La Couronne ne les a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n3. Les modalit\u00e9s et conditions du MCP ne sont pas claires [88] L\u2019existence de modalit\u00e9s et de conditions et leur teneur sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre claires. Le MNP renferme uniquement quelques-unes des modalit\u00e9s et conditions de financement; d\u2019autres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9es verbalement (Contre-interrogatoire de Mme Odette Johnston, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 6, pages 210 et 211). \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 du contre-interrogatoire, Mme Johnston a indiqu\u00e9 que les modalit\u00e9s et conditions ne figurent pas dans le MNP; il se peut qu\u2019elles soient \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sentation du MAINC au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et communiqu\u00e9es verbalement aux organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations. Ni le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Johnston, ni son affidavit, ne permettent de conna\u00eetre avec certitude la teneur de ces modalit\u00e9s et conditions, leur mode de mise en \u0153uvre, le responsable de la mise en \u0153uvre et leur incidence sur la prestation de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Les arguments \u00e9crits de la Couronne comportent \u00e9galement des lacunes au sujet des modalit\u00e9s et conditions. La Couronne \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Le MAINC conclut avec les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des ententes de financement et des protocoles d\u2019entente pr\u00e9voyant des modalit\u00e9s et des conditions explicites \u00bb (arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, page 705, paragraphe 45). Or, la Couronne omet de les d\u00e9crire et d\u2019expliquer l\u2019interaction entre les modalit\u00e9s et conditions non \u00e9crites du Programme des SEFPN et les modalit\u00e9s et conditions \u00e9crites figurant dans les ententes de financement.\n4. Ententes sur l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale non d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u2013 Preuve insuffisante [89] De plus, la transcription comporte des allusions \u00e0 des ententes d\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, ententes qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Par exemple, voir la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re nation Spallumcheen en C.-B. (Contre-interrogatoire de Mme Cindy Blackstock, D. Ph., arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 7, page 329). Le dossier ne permet pas de d\u00e9terminer quels arguments les parties tentent de soulever \u00e0 ce sujet.\n5. La preuve ne permet pas de pr\u00e9ciser la fa\u00e7on dont fonctionne l\u2019Entente globale de financement [90] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l\u2019Entente globale de financement intervenue entre le Manitoba et la Southeast Child and Family Services Inc. Cette entente stipule que le MAINC verse de l\u2019argent (soit quelque 17 millions de dollars dans un cas) \u00e0 l\u2019organisme \u00e0 la condition que les fonds soient utilis\u00e9s pour l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s et conditions de l\u2019entente (Entente globale de financement, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 4A, clause 2.1). Or, l\u2019entente pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que le MAINC peut r\u00e9duire le financement si le ministre modifie la formule. Elle pr\u00e9voit que, malgr\u00e9 les autres dispositions de l\u2019entente, en cas de modification de la formule \u00e9tablie par le ministre, le MAINC peut r\u00e9duire le niveau du financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019organisme des Premi\u00e8res nations qui assure la prestation des services (Entente globale de financement, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 4A, alin\u00e9a 2.5.2e)). L\u2019entente ne semble pas pr\u00e9ciser quand et comment ces modifications peuvent \u00eatre apport\u00e9es. Or, les conditions d\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, sont d\u00e9terminantes pour ce qui est de trancher la question du contr\u00f4le que peut exercer le MAINC sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. La Couronne n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions sur l\u2019entente et sur la fa\u00e7on dont fonctionnent les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res nations au Manitoba aux termes de cette entente. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, je ne peux pas dire, \u00e0 partir du dossier de preuve, si la capacit\u00e9 de modifier la formule constitue un indice que le MAINC exerce un contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ou si elle permet de conclure que le MAINC d\u00e9cide de la teneur des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance.\n[91] Au Manitoba, il existe quatre autorit\u00e9s responsables de surveiller, de superviser et de soutenir les organismes qui fournissent directement de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serve. Il semble y avoir quatorze fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations au Manitoba, et dix des ententes de financement sont administr\u00e9es par la Southern Authority (Affidavit de Mme Odette Johnston, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 2; et affidavit de Mme Elsie Flette, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 4). Les quatre ententes restantes sont peut-\u00eatre administr\u00e9es par les trois autres autorit\u00e9s. Bref, pour le Manitoba uniquement, il existe au moins treize autres ententes de financement du genre que la Couronne n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n6. La preuve ne pr\u00e9cise pas le fonctionnement de l\u2019Entente de 1965 et n\u2019indique pas si toutes les ententes pertinentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es [92] Aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965, l\u2019Ontario finance des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sans but lucratif d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et le MAINC lui rembourse une fraction de ses d\u00e9penses relativement aux enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Or, l\u2019Entente de 1965 est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1965 et elle peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9e par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre partie moyennant un pr\u00e9avis \u00e9crit de 12 mois (Entente sur le bien-\u00eatre social de 1965, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 8A, clause 8(1)). Il serait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moins au sujet de cette clause, parce que son existence (et la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit invoqu\u00e9e par les gouvernements parties) pourrait jeter un \u00e9clairage sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue du r\u00f4le de supervision jou\u00e9 par le MAINC dans la prestation des services vis\u00e9s. Au nombre des autres documents du dossier n\u00e9cessitant plus d\u2019explications, mentionnons une s\u00e9rie d\u2019instruments cens\u00e9s modifier l\u2019Entente de 1965 par voie de protocoles dat\u00e9s de 1971, 1972, 1981 et 1998. La preuve ne pr\u00e9cise pas le statut des divers services d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019Entente de 1965, celui des lois habilitantes qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es ou des diverses modifications et de leurs cons\u00e9quences. En Ontario, il existe des ententes de services particuli\u00e8res entre la province et des organisations autoris\u00e9es et non autoris\u00e9es de services \u00e0 l\u2019Enfance et \u00e0 la famille relevant des Premi\u00e8res nations ou de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (Contre-interrogatoire de Tom Goff, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 8, page 456). Dans ce cas aussi, la Couronne n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les ententes et n\u2019en a pas expliqu\u00e9 le fonctionnement en regard du financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC.\n7. Impossibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si le MAINC exerce un contr\u00f4le sur les mesures de pr\u00e9vention [93] Le groupe de plaignantes a soulign\u00e9 que le plus r\u00e9cent r\u00e9gime de financement du MAINC, l\u2019AAAP, comporte toujours des lacunes en ce qui a trait au financement de parties des programmes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance tels que les mesures de pr\u00e9vention (programmes visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le risque qu\u2019un enfant soit retir\u00e9 de sa famille). Le financement du MAINC continue d\u2019\u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 au respect des normes provinciales par les fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations. La Directive 20-1 et l\u2019AAAP sont toutes deux cens\u00e9es permettre le financement de ces types de services (Affidavit de Mme Odette Johnston, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 2). Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile que la Couronne indique si les diverses lois provinciales pr\u00e9voient des dispositions concernant la prise de mesures de pr\u00e9vention.\n8. Impossibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si le MAINC prend des mesures de v\u00e9rification qui vont plus loin que la reddition de comptes [94] Le MAINC effectue des v\u00e9rifications et des examens sur la gestion et la conformit\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations. Dans le cadre de ces examens, le MAINC passe en revue les dossiers des enfants plac\u00e9s, les proc\u00e8s-verbaux du conseil des gouverneurs, et les organismes du Manitoba proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification du casier judiciaire des employ\u00e9s (Contre-interrogatoire de Mme Elsie Flette, arguments \u00e9crits du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, onglet 9). Le MAINC examine les r\u00e8glements administratifs des fournisseurs de services et leurs modifications et d\u00e9livre des lettres signalant les lacunes. Bien que la position de la Couronne voulant que le MAINC ne proc\u00e8de qu\u2019\u00e0 une v\u00e9rification des comptes puisse \u00eatre un argument valable, la Couronne n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve superficiels concernant les proc\u00e9dures de v\u00e9rification et d\u2019examen. La preuve ne dresse pas un portrait complet des proc\u00e9dures de v\u00e9rification en lien avec les diverses ententes de financement.\nD. Conclusion - La Couronne ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de preuve \u2013 elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment de preuves ou d\u2019observations pour d\u00e9montrer que le programme de financement n\u2019est pas un Service [95] En conclusion, la Couronne n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le cadre d\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate offre une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d\u2019examiner la question des \u00ab services \u00bb. Le fait qu\u2019elle ait omis ou ait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9poser les documents requis dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate illustre par le fait m\u00eame la complexit\u00e9 de la question et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de tenir l\u2019audience viva voce sollicit\u00e9e par les plaignantes. La v\u00e9ritable nature du programme de financement et ses cons\u00e9quences pour les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des fonds demeurent obscures, malgr\u00e9 les documents, les affidavits et les transcriptions produits.\n[96] Toutefois, les commentaires que j\u2019ai fait au sujet de cette question des \u00ab services \u00bb ne visent aucunement \u00e0 nier la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve sur ce point avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 si la question devait \u00eatre entendue dans le cadre d\u2019une audience viva voce.\n[97] Ainsi que je l\u2019ai observ\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la magnitude et la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte est sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans l\u2019histoire du Tribunal. La plainte est une contestation globale du financement accord\u00e9 par le MAINC dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada, dans toutes les provinces et dans un territoire, aupr\u00e8s de tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du financement et des Premi\u00e8res nations, r\u00e9unis dans un seul dossier. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on demande au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la relation entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, dix provinces et un territoire et 108 fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res nations. Les fondements factuels de la plainte vont jusqu\u2019au c\u0153ur des politiques, des lignes directrices, des ententes de financement d\u2019un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, soit le MAINC, ainsi que des lois, des pratiques, des politiques et des lignes directrices des provinces et territoires, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, sans compter les ententes intergouvernementales sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Il pourrait ne pas \u00eatre possible de trancher la question des \u00ab services \u00bb sur une base aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble des organismes de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Lors de l\u2019audience sur le fond, les plaignantes devront \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral intervient dans la prestation des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pour chacun de ces organismes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ultimement, l\u2019instruction de la question des services sera ax\u00e9e sur les faits. La nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue pr\u00e9cises du processus d\u00e9cisionnel du MAINC doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 travers une myriade de dispositions et d\u2019ententes subordonn\u00e9es, afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir avec pr\u00e9cision l\u2019impact des d\u00e9cisions prises sur les services re\u00e7us, dans les r\u00e9serves, par les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res nations. Il ressort clairement du dossier de la Couronne que la requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019instrument indiqu\u00e9 pour ce volet de l\u2019instruction.\nE. Les autres arguments de la Couronne (i) NIL\/TU,O - Preuve [98] Le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations concernant un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Bien que cet arr\u00eat ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant pour la question des \u00ab services \u00bb, l\u2019analyse faite par la Cour supr\u00eame dans cette affaire fournit au Tribunal un aper\u00e7u du type d\u2019information dont il a besoin pour rendre, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une d\u00e9cision appropri\u00e9e au sujet des \u00ab services \u00bb. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a examin\u00e9 certains des facteurs suivants pour se prononcer sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence constitutionnelle concernant les relations de travail de la NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society : l\u2019entente de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation tripartite intervenue entre la province de la Colombie-Britannique, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et la NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society; la relation entre cette entente et la British Columbia Child, Family and Community Service Act; une \u00ab matrice de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00bb jointe \u00e0 l\u2019entente de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation tripartite; les normes et les indicateurs de pratique et de fonctionnement autochtones; la Directive 20-1; et les activit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res de la NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society. Le m\u00eame type d\u2019information a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la comp\u00e9tence de la Native Child and Family Services of Toronto en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Dans NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, comme dans Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un seul organisme d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance.\n(ii) Justiciabilit\u00e9 [99] Finalement, les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la Couronne pour faire valoir que la politique de financement du MAINC est le reflet d\u2019une politique relevant purement du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif qui ne peut \u00eatre invalid\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP ne sont d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9. Ils passent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019analyse des services requis. Le principe de la justiciabilit\u00e9 se pr\u00e9occupe essentiellement des limites appropri\u00e9es des fonctions et pouvoirs de la Cour par rapport aux autres institutions du gouvernement. Ainsi, on peut lire l\u2019observation suivante dans le Renvoi relatif au R\u00e9gime d\u2019assistance publique du Canada, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 525 :\nDans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question qui, all\u00e8gue-t-on, ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux, la Cour doit veiller surtout \u00e0 conserver le r\u00f4le qui lui revient dans le cadre constitutionnel de notre forme d\u00e9mocratique de gouvernement. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[100] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession du Qu\u00e9bec, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 217, au paragraphe 26, la question de la justiciabilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9finie en fonction du fait pour la Cour, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la question, d\u2019outrepasser ce qu\u2019elle estime \u00eatre le r\u00f4le qui lui revient dans le cadre constitutionnel de notre forme d\u00e9mocratique de gouvernement ou de ne pas donner une r\u00e9ponse relevant de son champ d\u2019expertise : l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du droit. Enfin, dans Bruker c. Marcovitz, 2007 CSC 54, au paragraphe 41, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019ouvrage de Dean Sossin, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (Toronto : Carswell, 1999)\u2014 un texte sur lequel se fonde \u00e9galement la Couronne dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate dont je suis saisie \u2014 pour d\u00e9finir la \u00ab justiciabilit\u00e9 \u00bb comme un ensemble de r\u00e8gles, de normes et de principes jurisprudentiels d\u00e9limitant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019intervention judiciaire dans la vie sociale, politique et \u00e9conomique. Pour trancher une plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, ce sont les dispositions de la LCDP m\u00eame qui doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es et non des \u00ab r\u00e8gles jurisprudentielles \u00bb. Toute exception \u00e0 l\u2019application de ses dispositions doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement (Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, au paragraphe 81 (Vaid)).\n[101] La Couronne pr\u00e9tend que le transfert de fonds par le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n\u2019a pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 en droit dans le cadre d\u2019all\u00e9gations de n\u00e9gligence et de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de fiduciaire parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de proximit\u00e9 suffisante entre le bailleur de fonds et les personnes qui assurent la prestation des services (Aksidan c. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 BCCA 43, aux paragraphes 13 \u00e0 15, et Renvoi relatif \u00e0 Broome c. \u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, 2010 CSC 11, au paragraphe 45). D\u2019abord, par principe, je note que ces affaires appliquent le droit tel qu\u2019il \u00e9volue dans des domaines qui ne peuvent venir en aide au Tribunal (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, et Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268). De plus, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces d\u00e9cisions sont \u00e9clair\u00e9es, elles confirment la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner dans quelle mesure la Couronne exerce un contr\u00f4le sur le financement et sa proximit\u00e9 par rapport au dernier b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des services, et ce, au moyen d\u2019un examen approfondi de la relation entre le MAINC et les enfants et familles des Premi\u00e8res nations.\nVII. ANALYSE DE LA PERTINENCE D\u2019UN GROUPE DE COMPARAISON DANS LE CADRE DE L\u2019INSTRUCTION D\u2019UNE REQU\u00caTE \u2013 QUESTION DE DROIT A. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des positions des parties La Couronne\n[102] La Couronne fait valoir qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une comparaison afin de d\u00e9terminer qu\u2019il y a eu un traitement d\u00e9favorable. Elle soutient en outre qu\u2019il doit y avoir une diff\u00e9rence dans la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019intention de deux individus ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires diff\u00e9rents. L\u2019alin\u00e9a ne permet pas de comparer deux fournisseurs de services destin\u00e9s \u00e0 deux \u00ab publics \u00bb diff\u00e9rents. Il ne permet pas non plus de comparer le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces. La Couronne reconna\u00eet l\u2019importance des principes sous\u2011tendant la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne mais ne consid\u00e8re pas que la plainte rel\u00e8ve du mandat \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la Loi. M\u00eame si elle convient qu\u2019elle a une obligation de fiduciaire envers les peuples des Premi\u00e8res nations, elle estime que cette obligation et ses autres engagements internationaux n\u2019\u00e9tendent pas la port\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP.\nLes plaignantes\n[103] Selon les plaignantes, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son sens large et lib\u00e9ral, compte tenu de la nature quasi constitutionnelle de la Loi. Les plaignantes soutiennent que l\u2019objet m\u00eame de la Loi consiste \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires, y compris la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP ne n\u00e9cessite aucune comparaison. Elles estiment que l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de trouver un groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 ne fait pas \u00e9chec \u00e0 la plainte; ils donnent \u00e0 cette fin l\u2019exemple des personnes d\u00e9ficientes, qui ne sont pas tenues de prouver qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es pour avoir gain de cause dans une plainte de discrimination. Les plaignantes affirment que l\u2019analyse devrait viser essentiellement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un service r\u00e9pond aux besoins de ceux qui sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s en raison d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle immuable.\n[104] Subsidiairement, les plaignantes font valoir que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre la comparaison entre deux diff\u00e9rents fournisseurs de services et qu\u2019il peut s\u2019agir du MAINC et des provinces. Les plaignantes all\u00e8guent que la Couronne n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 de faire une comparaison avec un autre fournisseur, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une province, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais refus\u00e9 auparavant de recourir \u00e0 des groupes de comparaison appartenant \u00e0 des ressorts diff\u00e9rents. Par ailleurs, dans le contexte d\u2019une audience de vive voix, l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de cette comparaison sera manifeste.\n[105] En outre, l\u2019APN estime que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du MAINC peuvent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations habitant dans une r\u00e9serve qui re\u00e7oivent une aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du syst\u00e8me provincial.\n[106] En dernier lieu, les plaignantes soutiennent que le MAINC est le seul fournisseur d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fond\u00e9e sur la race dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient en fin de compte les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations habitant dans une r\u00e9serve. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une cons\u00e9quence du partage constitutionnel des comp\u00e9tences, qui investit le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la comp\u00e9tence sur cette question au paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 constitutionnelle emp\u00eache l\u2019application rigide du crit\u00e8re habituel fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Singh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et fait en sorte que la Loi ne peut prot\u00e9ger tout ce groupe d\u2019enfants canadiens. Il est impossible que le Parlement ait eu l\u2019intention d\u2019obliger, dans une situation comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la tenue d\u2019une analyse comparative. Une telle obligation ne concorde pas non plus avec la jurisprudence attribuant une nature quasi constitutionnelle \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ce qui commande une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale. C\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement le cas en raison des obligations fiduciaires de la Couronne envers les Premi\u00e8res nations et de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion du Canada \u00e0 la DNUDPA. Cet obstacle l\u00e9gal n\u2019existe dans aucune autre affaire o\u00f9 l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e. Si je d\u00e9cidais qu\u2019une comparaison n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire ou qu\u2019aucune analyse de la discrimination impliquant deux fournisseurs de services ne doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e, je me retrouverais \u00e0 confirmer une notion \u00e0 caract\u00e8re racial de discrimination suivant laquelle les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations habitant dans une r\u00e9serve sont priv\u00e9s d\u2019une aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e9quivalente ou similaire \u00e0 celle dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient tous les autres enfants canadiens.\nB. L\u2019analyse de la pertinence d\u2019une comparaison est une pure question de droit [107] Les plaignantes ont-elles eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations comme l\u2019exige la Loi au sujet de la question relative au groupe de comparaison? Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pure question de droit. De fait, comme je l\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, le renvoi de la plainte par la Commission caract\u00e9risait les points soulev\u00e9s par les plaignantes comme \u00e9tant des questions de droit et non de fait. Les parties ont eu amplement la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations et m\u00eame des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires. Sur cette question, les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de d\u00e9poser des affidavits, de contre-interroger les auteurs des affidavits, de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal avec l\u2019aide de leurs avocats et de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (voir l\u2019annexe A). En outre, elles ont eu jusqu\u2019au 23 ao\u00fbt et au 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010, respectivement, pour d\u00e9poser des observations sur trois nouveaux jugements, soit CDPNB c. PNB, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, publi\u00e9 le 3 juin 2010, et deux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, NIL\/TU,O, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, rendus en m\u00eame temps le 4 novembre 2010, de m\u00eame que sur la DNUDPA. Aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une audience de vive voix ne pourra rendre ce point juridique plus clair.\nC. Que signifie le verbe \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi? Comment cet alin\u00e9a doit-il \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9? [108] L\u2019article 5 dispose ce qui suit :\nRefus de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou d\u2019h\u00e9bergement\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture\n1976-77, ch. 33, art. 5.\nDenial of good, service, facility or accommodation\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n1976-77, c. 33, s. 5.\n[109] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une d\u00e9marche pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 suivre pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois bilingues (R. c. Daoust, 2004 CSC 6, au paragraphe 27 (Daoust)). La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consiste donc ici \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a divergence entre les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019il est possible de trouver un sens commun (voir R. c. S.A.C., 2008 CSC 47, au paragraphe15 (S.A.C.), Daoust, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 27). Si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP peut avoir des significations diff\u00e9rentes, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer le genre de divergence dont il s\u2019agit. Dans son ouvrage Interpr\u00e9tation des lois, 3e \u00e9d. (Scarborough, Ontario, Carswell, 2000), P.-A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9voque trois possibilit\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8rement, les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise peuvent \u00eatre inconciliables. En pareil cas, il est impossible de trouver un sens commun et, par cons\u00e9quent, les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ordinaires s\u2019appliquent (S.A.C., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 15; Daoust, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 27; C\u00f4t\u00e9, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 327). Deuxi\u00e8mement, une version peut \u00eatre ambigu\u00eb alors que l\u2019autre est claire et non \u00e9quivoque. Le sens commun est alors celui de la version claire et non \u00e9quivoque (S.A.C., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 15; Daoust, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 28; C\u00f4t\u00e9, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 327). Troisi\u00e8mement, une version peut avoir un sens plus large que l\u2019autre. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, le sens commun aux deux favorise le sens le plus restreint ou limit\u00e9 (S.A.C., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 15; Daoust, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 29; C\u00f4t\u00e9, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 327). \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le sens commun concorde avec l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur (S.A.C., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 16; Daoust, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 30; C\u00f4t\u00e9, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 328).\n[110] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vaid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 que, pour interpr\u00e9ter correctement les lois, \u00ab [traduction] [\u2026] il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (au paragraphe 80).\n[111] Ces principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation s\u2019appliquent avec une rigueur particuli\u00e8re dans le cadre de l\u2019application des lois relatives aux droits de la personne (Vaid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 80 et 81). S\u2019il est reconnu que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00ab large et lib\u00e9rale \u00bb, il est aussi vrai que les termes d\u2019une loi doivent \u00eatre en mesure de recevoir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019on leur pr\u00eate (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 13). Cette approche trouve un appui \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I-21, qui \u00e9nonce que \u00ab [t]out texte est cens\u00e9 apporter une solution de droit et s\u2019interpr\u00e8te de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9quitable et la plus large qui soit compatible avec la r\u00e9alisation de son objet. Dans la d\u00e9cision Berg, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, l\u2019ancien juge en chef Lamer s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 comme suit au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00ab large, lib\u00e9rale et fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 \u00bb de la loi de la Colombie-Britannique sur les droits de la personne :\nCette m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ne permet pas \u00e0 une commission ou \u00e0 une cour de justice de faire abstraction des termes de la Loi pour emp\u00eacher les pratiques discriminatoires o\u00f9 que ce soit. Bien que ce puisse \u00eatre l\u00e0 un but louable, la l\u00e9gislature a affirm\u00e9, au moyen des termes restrictifs de l\u2019art. 3, que certaines relations ne seront pas sujettes \u00e0 un examen fond\u00e9 sur la loi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il incombe aux commissions et aux cours de justice de donner \u00e0 l\u2019art. 3 une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale et fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet vis\u00e9, sans faire abstraction des termes restrictifs de la Loi ni autrement contourner l\u2019intention de la l\u00e9gislature. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n(\u00e0 la page 371)\n[112] Tout au long de cette analyse, l\u2019intention du Parlement doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. La LCDP est une cr\u00e9ation du l\u00e9gislateur d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement. Toute exception \u00e0 l\u2019application de ses dispositions doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement (Vaid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 81). Les pactes internationaux comme la DNUDPA peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019approche contextuelle de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois (voir Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Cependant, \u00ab les normes internationales qui ne sont pas incorpor\u00e9es au droit canadien et qui sont incompatibles avec les dispositions claires d\u2019une loi ne peuvent avoir d\u2019effet au Canada \u00bb (Rahaman c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2002 CAF 89, au paragraphe 36). Par cons\u00e9quent, toute analyse doit commencer d\u2019abord par un examen rigoureux de la disposition pr\u00e9cise en cause.\nD. Analyse (i) Le traitement d\u00e9favorable est une notion comparative 1. Absence de sens commun \u2013 l\u2019anglais est clair, mais le fran\u00e7ais peut exiger une comparaison ou non [113] Dans la version anglaise, le sens ordinaire des termes \u00ab differentiate adversely \u00bb fait en sorte qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de comparer deux groupes. Le mot anglais \u00ab adverse \u00bb dans un contexte juridique a le sens d\u2019\u00ab oppos\u00e9 \u00bb ou de \u00ab contraire \u00bb (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6e \u00e9d., sous \u00ab Adverse \u00bb) et \u00ab differentiates \u00bb dans un contexte ordinaire signifie \u00ab reconna\u00eetre ou d\u00e9signer comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent, distinguer \u00bb (The Oxford English Dictionary, 2e \u00e9d., sous \u00ab Differentiates \u00bb). Le sens ordinaire de l\u2019expression anglaise exige une comparaison \u00e0 cause du terme \u00ab differentiate \u00bb. Le verbe \u00ab differentiate \u00bb \u00e9voque en effet une diff\u00e9rence par rapport \u00e0 quelque chose ou quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre. Il suppose le fait de distinguer, d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction. Afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, par d\u00e9finition, il est n\u00e9cessaire de comparer la situation du plaignant avec celle d\u2019une autre personne.\n[114] En fran\u00e7ais, le sens ordinaire du verbe \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi ne requiert pas n\u00e9cessairement de groupe de comparaison. La d\u00e9finition peut inclure un concept comparatif : \u00ab priver d\u2019un avantage \u00bb ou \u00ab priver d\u2019un avantage (consenti \u00e0 un autre ou qu\u2019on aurait pu lui consentir) \u00bb impliquent une comparaison, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas, toutefois, de \u00ab desservir \u00bb, \u00ab frustrer, handicaper \u00bb (Le Petit Robert, 2006, sous \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb). Le premier groupe de mots comprend la possibilit\u00e9 de faire une comparaison, mais pas le deuxi\u00e8me. Il y a ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, car le m\u00eame terme peut avoir deux significations. Par cons\u00e9quent, les r\u00e8gles normales d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es pour qu\u2019on puisse savoir qu\u2019elle est l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n2. Le Parlement souhaitait que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une comparaison [115] La Loi est une cr\u00e9ature unique du Parlement et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) est une disposition aussi unique r\u00e9pondant aux aspirations du l\u00e9gislateur quand il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 la LCDP. La gen\u00e8se de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination en mati\u00e8re emploi et des pratiques pr\u00e9judiciables en cours d\u2019emploi. La Loi provient d\u2019un ensemble disparate de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives visant principalement \u00e0 interdire la discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, mais aussi \u00e0 sanctionner les actes discriminatoires commis contre certaines personnes dans la fourniture de services au public (voir W.S. Tarnopolsky, J., Discrimination and the Law, r\u00e9v. par W. Pentney (Toronto, Carswell, 1993) (suppl\u00e9ment permanent), aux pages 2-3 et 2-4). Ces origines sont importantes, puisque le terme \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb se retrouve aux alin\u00e9as 6b) et 7b) de la Loi \u00e9galement. L\u2019analyse utilis\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP est donc tout aussi applicable dans les domaines de l\u2019emploi qu\u2019en ce qui concerne les locaux commerciaux. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) doit \u00eatre coh\u00e9rente et appropri\u00e9e \u00e9galement pour les alin\u00e9as 6b) et 7b) de la Loi.\n[116] Le r\u00e9gime instaur\u00e9 par la Loi et son objet peuvent se d\u00e9duire de l\u2019article 2, qui \u00e9nonce l\u2019objet de la loi et donne effet au principe, dans la version anglaise, \u00ab that all individuals should have and opportunity equal with other individuals [...] \u00bb. La version fran\u00e7aise mentionne quant \u00e0 elle le droit \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement \u00bb. La disposition \u00e9non\u00e7ant l\u2019objet de la Loi confirme que celle-ci est fond\u00e9e sur la notion de comparaison : dans les deux versions, le concept d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 d\u00e9note une comparaison. \u00ab Equal \u00bb en droit suppose non pas l\u2019identit\u00e9 mais la dualit\u00e9 et l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une chose pour en mesurer une autre (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6e \u00e9d., sous \u00ab Equal \u00bb). \u00ab Equal \u00bb dans son sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral signifie [traduction] \u00ab de m\u00eame quantit\u00e9, qualit\u00e9, taille, degr\u00e9, rang, niveau, etc. \u00bb (The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 9e \u00e9d. sous \u00ab Equal \u00bb). En fran\u00e7ais, l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb vient de l\u2019adjectif \u00ab \u00e9gal \u00bb, signifiant \u00ab [q]ui est de m\u00eame quantit\u00e9, dimension, nature, qualit\u00e9 ou valeur \u00bb (le Petit Robert, 2006, sous \u00ab \u00e9gal \u00bb). Les d\u00e9finitions dans les deux langues impliquent une comparaison.\n[117] De fait, au paragraphe 17 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reformul\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) au moyen de termes emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alg\u00e8bre : il est discriminatoire que A, quand il fournit des services \u00e0 B, traite celui-ci diff\u00e9remment de C pour un motif de distinction illicite.\nLa Cour a illustr\u00e9 ce principe au moyen d\u2019un exemple concret : il serait ainsi discriminatoire qu\u2019un policier, charg\u00e9 de fournir des services de contr\u00f4le de la circulation destin\u00e9s au public, traite une personne en contravention plus durement qu\u2019une autre en raison de son origine nationale ou raciale.\n[118] La jurisprudence plus r\u00e9cente confirme encore la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 une comparaison. La juge Mactavish s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e comme suit dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490 (Walden) :\nL\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 est une notion \u00e9minemment relative. Pour savoir s\u2019il y a eu diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement \u00e0 raison d\u2019un motif illicite, il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de comparer la situation du groupe de plaignantes avec celle d\u2019un autre groupe. (Au paragraphe 78)\n[119] Dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, bien que le juge Evans n\u2019ait pas statu\u00e9 directement sur la question du groupe de comparaison, il a implicitement reconnu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des preuves comparatives pour d\u00e9terminer si la preuve prima facie de discrimination avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment \u00e9tablie :\nEn outre, comme l\u2019avocate de la Commission l\u2019a signal\u00e9, il est maintenant reconnu que la preuve comparative de discrimination rev\u00eat des formes beaucoup plus nombreuses que la discrimination particuli\u00e8re identifi\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes. (Au paragraphe 28)\n[120] Reportons-nous \u00e9galement \u00e0 Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. M.R.N., 2003 CF 1280 (Wignall), o\u00f9 le juge O\u2019Reilly a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nUne cour ou un tribunal ne peut d\u00e9cider si une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination sans \u00e9tablir des comparaisons avec le traitement accord\u00e9 aux autres personnes. Les comparaisons sont in\u00e9vitables. (Au paragraphe 22)\n3. Les arguments visant \u00e0 appliquer la jurisprudence fond\u00e9e sur la Charte ne respectent pas la teneur de la LCDP [121] Il est important maintenant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction avec la jurisprudence fond\u00e9e sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, ch. 11 (la Charte). Le libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP, o\u00f9 figure le terme \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb, doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. La jurisprudence appliquant la Charte peut \u00eatre utile pour cette analyse. Cependant, elle ne peut \u00eatre transpos\u00e9e telle quelle dans les instances du TCDP sans qu\u2019on ait cern\u00e9 l\u2019intention exacte du l\u00e9gislateur. Dans la d\u00e9cision Wignall, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur quand il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait convergence des d\u00e9marches suivies \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des lois sur les droits de la personne et du paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte. Elle a jug\u00e9 que le Tribunal avait a commis une erreur lorsqu\u2019il a analys\u00e9 la plainte au regard de toutes les modalit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Law c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 1 R.C.S. 497 (Law). Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9finition du terme \u2018discrimination\u2019 au sens du paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte, dont il est d\u2019ailleurs question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Law, ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne \u00bb (Wignall, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 8). Elle a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 que Law, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ne portait que sur le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la norme constitutionnelle d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la Charte et que la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre que sa d\u00e9marche devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e plus largement aux codes et aux lois sur les droits de la personne qu\u2019on retrouve dans les l\u00e9gislations provinciale ou f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[122] Pour les m\u00eames raisons, je ne crois pas que l\u2019arr\u00eat Cunningham c. Alberta (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2009 ABCA 239, soit utile pour trancher l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En effet, cette d\u00e9cision concernait une demande visant \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019article 75 et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 90(1)a) de la M\u00e9tis Settlements Act, R.S.A. 2000, ch. M-14, violaient l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2d), l\u2019article 7 et le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte. La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a centr\u00e9 son analyse exclusivement sur la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse d\u00e9crite dans la d\u00e9cision Law, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la diff\u00e9rence de traitement constituait de la discrimination.\n[123] J\u2019ajouterais en dernier lieu sur ce point qu\u2019aucune des plaignantes n\u2019a contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP.\n4. Les arguments visant \u00e0 appliquer la jurisprudence fond\u00e9e sur d\u2019autres lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ne respectent pas la teneur de la LCDP [124] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fait valoir que l\u2019omission de trouver un groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 ne devrait pas faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 la plainte de discrimination puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas clair qu\u2019une comparaison soit requise dans une analyse effectu\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cite la d\u00e9cision Lane c. ADGA Group Consultants Inc. (2008), 295 D.L.R. (4th) 425, 91 O.R. (3d) 649 (C. S. J. Ont. (C. div.)) (ADGA). Cette affaire concernant une cessation d\u2019emploi se fondait sur le Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario, L.R.O. 1990, ch. H-19. Dans ADGA, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9nonce clairement au paragraphe 94 que [traduction] \u00ab lorsque la d\u00e9ficience entre en jeu dans le contexte d\u2019une cessation d\u2019emploi, il n\u2019est ni n\u00e9cessaire ni appropri\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir un groupe de comparaison \u00bb. Les affaires o\u00f9 il est question d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience reposent sur des situations particuli\u00e8res et individuelles. Une fois qu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que le cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait en partie ou en totalit\u00e9 attribuable \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, la non-pertinence de la comparaison dans la d\u00e9cision ADGA, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, d\u00e9coulait en grande partie du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du cong\u00e9diement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u2013 ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas ici.\n[125] En outre, l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire ADGA, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, n\u2019est pas surprenante quand on consid\u00e8re que le Parlement a \u00e9limin\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une comparaison dans les plaintes relatives \u00e0 une cessation d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9es sur la LCDP (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a)) et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019exige pas non plus quand il y a refus de services (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a)), refus d\u2019occupation de locaux (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6a)) ou refus de fournir des logements (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6a)). Cependant, l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente entre les paragraphes d\u2019un m\u00eame article de la Loi. Ainsi, contrairement aux dispositions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, les alin\u00e9as 5b), 6b) et 7b) de la Loi mentionnent express\u00e9ment l\u2019action de \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb, et une analyse comparative est alors indiqu\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision ADGA, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour justifier le non-respect des choix l\u00e9gislatifs clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le Parlement.\n[126] Pour les m\u00eames raisons, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que les commentaires formul\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CDPNB c. PNB, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, soient vraiment utiles pour le Tribunal dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis de la LCDP. La loi du Nouveau-Brunswick en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne mentionne en effet le refus de fournir des services et sanctionne la discrimination dans la prestation de services. Elle ne dit rien au sujet de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, contrairement \u00e0 la LCDP.\n5. Conclusion [127] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi n\u00e9cessite une comparaison. Voil\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, concorde le plus avec le libell\u00e9 de la Loi, le r\u00e9gime qu\u2019elle instaure et son objet ainsi qu\u2019avec l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n(ii) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) ne permet pas de comparer deux fournisseurs de services [128] Ni la version anglaise ni la version fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi ne disposent express\u00e9ment qu\u2019il faut tenir compte d\u2019un seul fournisseur de services pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une distinction pr\u00e9judiciable. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, le sens grammatical et ordinaire des termes employ\u00e9s \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a permettent d\u2019envisager qu\u2019un seul fournisseur puisse \u00eatre tenu responsable d\u2019avoir d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 quelqu\u2019un dans la prestation de services \u00e0 deux personnes diff\u00e9rentes. Cette conclusion est coh\u00e9rente avec l\u2019analyse effectu\u00e9e dans Singh, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[129] Qui plus est, l\u2019analyse en fonction de plus d\u2019un fournisseur de services \u00e9largit la port\u00e9e de cette disposition de fa\u00e7on absurde. Tout \u00e9largissement de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) n\u00e9cessite que soit \u00e9tendue aussi la port\u00e9e des alin\u00e9as 6b) et 7b) de la Loi. En acceptant qu\u2019un fournisseur de services puisse \u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre, et que plus d\u2019un employeur puisse \u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre \u00e9galement, nous ouvririons la porte toute grande \u00e0 une avalanche de nouveaux genres de plaintes visant non seulement la fourniture de services mais aussi le domaine de l\u2019emploi. Par exemple, une employ\u00e9e pourrait invoquer un traitement diff\u00e9rent qui lui est pr\u00e9judiciable par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u2019un autre employeur (l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la banque A pourrait se plaindre de toucher des avantages diff\u00e9rents de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la banque B; l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation en Ontario pourrait se plaindre des politiques d\u2019emploi diff\u00e9rentes auxquelles il est assujetti, alors que l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation de la Colombie-Britannique ne l\u2019est pas). Dans le seul domaine des services, le client du restaurant A pourrait se plaindre d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u des services diff\u00e9rents de celui qu\u2019a re\u00e7us le client du restaurant B en raison de sa race. Le membre d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation au Qu\u00e9bec pourrait se plaindre du financement diff\u00e9rent qui lui est vers\u00e9 comparativement au membre d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation diff\u00e9rente en Alberta, en faisant valoir que la race est entr\u00e9e en jeu, puisque les Premi\u00e8res nations ne fournissent des services qu\u2019aux membres des Premi\u00e8res nations.\n[130] En dernier lieu, le partage constitutionnel des comp\u00e9tences vient compliquer les choses et rend la comparaison encore plus illogique. Comment et quand pourrait-on comparer les employeurs qui font partie des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et les employeurs qui font partie du gouvernement provincial ou bien les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux bailleurs de fonds et les minist\u00e8res provinciaux qui versent aussi des fonds?\n[131] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi pr\u00f4n\u00e9e par le groupe des plaignantes a un effet d\u2019\u00e9largissement tel et poss\u00e8de des ramifications \u00e0 ce point vastes qu\u2019elle ne peut, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 souhait\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur. Un bouleversement de cette envergure du cadre d\u2019analyse n\u00e9cessiterait, \u00e0 mon sens, une directive claire du l\u00e9gislateur.\n(iii) Arguments des plaignantes suivant lesquels le financement vers\u00e9 en fonction de la race exige une exception interpr\u00e9tative \u2013 des faits incontestables ne constituent pas de bonnes r\u00e8gles de droit [132] Les plaignantes m\u2019exhortent \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019aucune comparaison n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire dans le cas o\u00f9 les services sont fournis \u00e0 une seule race ou \u00e0 un seul peuple. Apr\u00e8s avoir longuement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 la position des plaignantes, je constate que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation propos\u00e9e par les plaignantes aurait des r\u00e9percussions peut-\u00eatre incongrues et illogiques sur les Premi\u00e8res nations elles-m\u00eames.\n[133] La Couronne n\u2019est pas le seul fournisseur de services r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux membres d\u2019un groupe racial. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, \u00e0 mon avis, si les consid\u00e9rations raciales peuvent \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fort pertinentes compte tenu du libell\u00e9 actuel de la Loi, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 imputer une responsabilit\u00e9 au MAINC, l\u2019analyse s\u2019appliquerait aussi carr\u00e9ment, dans d\u2019autres cas, \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res nations. Celles-ci, tout comme le MAINC, fournissent des services fond\u00e9s sur la race \u00e0 leurs membres. Elles s\u2019occupent de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, du logement et des services sociaux de m\u00eame que de tous les autres services destin\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs membres. Selon l\u2019analyse qui est avanc\u00e9e, une Premi\u00e8re nation pourrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre quant au niveau de financement et de services qu\u2019elle assure \u00e0 ses membres. Chaque Premi\u00e8re nation pourrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9e aux provinces et \u00e0 des tiers au chapitre des services fournis. Cette analyse pourrait viser chaque Premi\u00e8re nation et l\u2019obliger peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 fournir un niveau de financement et de services comparable aux autres Premi\u00e8res nations et aux provinces.\n[134] Les plaignantes citent CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, qu\u2019elles consid\u00e8rent comme un arr\u00eat original et novateur pour l\u2019\u00e9poque montrant que le Tribunal peut et devrait \u00e9tendre l\u2019application traditionnelle de la Loi \u00e0 de nouveaux domaines o\u00f9 il pourrait y avoir discrimination. Dans cette affaire, Action Travail des Femmes all\u00e9guait que le CN avait eu recours \u00e0 des pratiques discriminatoires dans l\u2019embauche et les promotions en refusant aux femmes l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 certains postes de cols bleus non sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s. Le Tribunal a conclu que les politiques de recrutement, d\u2019embauche et de promotion du CN emp\u00eachaient et d\u00e9courageaient les femmes d\u2019occuper des postes de cols bleus. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de la Loi (devenu l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)), le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un programme d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi au CN pour \u00e9liminer la discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans l\u2019embauche et la promotion des femmes. La Cour supr\u00eame devait d\u00e9terminer si le Tribunal avait le pouvoir d\u2019imposer cette mesure en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de la Loi. Elle a confirm\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation du programme ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal parce que l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal entrait dans la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 41(2) ou en respectait les exigences. Bien que cette r\u00e9paration ait \u00e9t\u00e9 in\u00e9dite, elle s\u2019appuyait sur un fondement l\u00e9gislatif clair. En outre, le Tribunal dans cette affaire n\u2019avait pas envisag\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir un nouveau domaine de discrimination; il a plut\u00f4t explor\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de ses pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration. Par cons\u00e9quent, il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre ce jugement et la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[135] Les plaignantes se sont \u00e9galement report\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. c. Gibbs, [1996] 3 R.C.S 566 (Gibbs), en vue d\u2019\u00e9tayer leurs arguments. Dans cette affaire, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance de la Saskatchewan avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers des personnes assur\u00e9es atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale comparativement \u00e0 des assur\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience physique. Il n\u2019y avait qu\u2019un seul fournisseur de services et ce dernier ne pouvait traiter diff\u00e9remment deux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de services pour ces motifs en restreignant les param\u00e8tres applicables. Les plaignantes font valoir que la seule diff\u00e9rence entre les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de services dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations habitant dans les r\u00e9serves, est le fait qu\u2019ils ne re\u00e7oivent pas tous la m\u00eame aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Sinon, ils ont le m\u00eame \u00e2ge et ont besoin d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ainsi que d\u2019un traitement similaire. Il n\u2019y a rien dans Gibbs, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, qui \u00e9voque deux fournisseurs de services diff\u00e9rents.\n(iv) Les arguments des plaignantes suivant lesquels la position de la Couronne engendre une situation inacceptable ne concordent pas avec le libell\u00e9 clair de la LCDP [136] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 affirme que l\u2019omission de tenir une audience et le fait de statuer en bout de ligne que la LCDP ne peut offrir de r\u00e9paration aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences inacceptables. Les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations se trouvent ainsi priv\u00e9s de la protection de la Loi, ce qui revient \u00e0 approuver une notion de discrimination raciale fond\u00e9e sur le principe \u00ab distinct mais \u00e9gal \u00bb semblable \u00e0 celle qui existait aux \u00c9tats-Unis et avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka et al., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (U.S. Sup. Ct.1954). Les Chefs rel\u00e8vent l\u2019abrogation, par le gouvernement, de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP qui interdisait auparavant au Tribunal de conna\u00eetre des plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I-5. Ils soulignent que, en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019abrogation de cet article, le MAINC serait plus ou moins soustrait \u00e0 l\u2019application de la LCDP. Les plaignantes font valoir que le Parlement a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment abrog\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 de la Loi afin d\u2019appliquer le principe \u00ab diviser pour r\u00e9gner \u00bb au sein des Premi\u00e8res nations.\n[137] Pour ce qui est de cet argument, je signalerai que, pour statuer sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 analyser comme telle l\u2019intention qui animait le Parlement quand il a abrog\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 de la Loi. L\u2019abrogation de cet article impose aux Premi\u00e8res nations, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de leurs membres, l\u2019obligation quasi judiciaire ou judiciaire de respecter la Loi. En pratique, cette modification aura pour effet d\u2019encourager la dissension entre les dirigeants de la Premi\u00e8re nation et ses membres. Dans une perspective contextuelle, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je signalerai que l\u2019abrogation de cette disposition, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, oblige le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les Premi\u00e8res nations, tout comme d\u2019autres fournisseurs de services et employeurs des secteurs public et priv\u00e9 r\u00e9glement\u00e9s par le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 la LCDP. Il y a alors deux cons\u00e9quences : les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux ne peuvent pratiquer la discrimination envers des membres des Premi\u00e8res nations pour des motifs illicites quand ils fournissent des services aux Autochtones. Par exemple, le gouvernement ne peut offrir des services aux membres des Premi\u00e8res nations et faire preuve de discrimination contre les membres des Premi\u00e8res nations qui ont une d\u00e9ficience ou qui sont de sexe f\u00e9minin. En m\u00eame temps, les Premi\u00e8res nations ne peuvent faire preuve de discrimination envers des membres des Premi\u00e8res nations quand ils fournissent des services aux membres de leur propre Premi\u00e8re nation. Par exemple, les Premi\u00e8res nations ne peuvent offrir de services \u00e0 leurs membres et traiter diff\u00e9remment des autres ceux qui ont une d\u00e9ficience ou qui sont de sexe f\u00e9minin. Au lieu de soustraire les Premi\u00e8res nations ou le gouvernement, dont le MAINC, \u00e0 toute responsabilit\u00e9 au regard de la LCDP, l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 impute une responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces deux parties qui pourraient \u00eatre mises en cause.\n[138] Je conviens que l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP fait en sorte que de nouveaux genres de plaintes peuvent d\u00e9sormais \u00eatre instruites par le Tribunal. Ces affaires seront probablement complexes et auront de graves cons\u00e9quences pour des collectivit\u00e9s enti\u00e8res de Canadiens appartenant \u00e0 une Premi\u00e8re nation. Elles exigeront du Tribunal qu\u2019il fasse preuve d\u2019\u00e9norm\u00e9ment d\u2019imagination pour pouvoir les g\u00e9rer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e et adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la culture autochtone. Chacune d\u2019entre elles devra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e sur le fond au cas par cas. Le fait qu\u2019il ne puisse y avoir r\u00e9paration dans la pr\u00e9sente instance ne signifie pas que d\u2019autres plaignants seront d\u00e9bout\u00e9s. Il est probable qu\u2019une plainte de discrimination ne puisse, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre accueillie contre le MAINC et que ce r\u00e9sultat soit sans doute d\u00e9concertant pour les communaut\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations, mais la LCDP ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en fonction des r\u00e9sultats. Ce sont les termes de la Loi qui doivent r\u00e9gir la port\u00e9e de la plainte et de la r\u00e9paration. Malheureusement, si la LCDP n\u2019offre aucune voie de redressement ici, c\u2019est qu\u2019un autre recours peut vraisemblablement \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 ailleurs (p. ex. une contestation de la Loi fond\u00e9e sur la Charte ou une r\u00e9paration d\u2019ordre politique).\n[139] Tout en ayant conscience des r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de sur les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations qui habitent dans une r\u00e9serve, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus haut, j\u2019estime que non seulement est-il illogique d\u2019\u00e9tendre l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur un groupe de comparaison, mais que cet \u00e9largissement risque en plus de s\u2019av\u00e9rer destructeur pour les Premi\u00e8res nations elles-m\u00eames. En outre, l\u2019APN a propos\u00e9 que le Tribunal compare les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations habitant dans une r\u00e9serve qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations qui re\u00e7oivent une aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance au sein du syst\u00e8me provincial. Cependant, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi, un traitement diff\u00e9rent sera jug\u00e9 discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Cet argument subsidiaire ne parvient pas \u00e0 cerner un tel motif de distinction illicite. Encore une fois, il repose sur la comparaison entre deux fournisseurs diff\u00e9rents.\n[140] Vu la conclusion que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9e au sujet du groupe de comparaison, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur l\u2019argument de la Couronne relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu non plus de m\u2019attarder \u00e0 la question de la r\u00e9paration conform\u00e9ment au Principe de Jordan.\nVIII. CONCLUSION [141] M\u00eame si je ne peux trancher la question concernant les services \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve au dossier r\u00e9unie jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, je peux statuer sur le point de droit relatif \u00e0 la comparaison. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus haut, la requ\u00eate de la Couronne est accueillie sur la question relative au groupe de comparaison. Je suis d\u2019avis que la plainte ne respecte pas les dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\n\u00abSign\u00e9e par\u00bb\nShirish P.

Lustig\nDate: Le 16 mars 2011\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence: 2011 TCDP 5\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision concernant la requ\u00eate que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 19 janvier 2011 visant l\u2019ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en attendant l\u2019issue de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) par laquelle la Commission demandait au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[2] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 11 septembre 2006. Elle soutient qu\u2019entre juin 2006 et le 25 ao\u00fbt 2006, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans le cadre de son emploi en ne l\u2019embauchant pas au poste de contrema\u00eetre, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences que les hommes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle avait plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019eux dans le domaine. La plaignante est une d\u00e9bardeuse qui travaille pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, chargeant et d\u00e9chargeant des bateaux de croisi\u00e8re au port de Vancouver.\n[3] Le 29 juillet 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plaine.\n[4] Le 30 ao\u00fbt 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son avis de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (dossier T-1388-10).\n[5] Le 10 janvier 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demandait une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019instruction acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e du contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[6] Le 27 janvier 2011, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu une ordonnance rejetant la requ\u00eate en instruction acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e et \u00e9tablissant l\u2019audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire au mardi 15 mars 2011 et au mercredi 16 mars 2011. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLa demanderesse ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont si exceptionnelles qu\u2019elles justifient une instruction acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e. De plus, la requ\u00eate est aussi devenue inutile en raison de l\u2019ordonnance rendue le 14 janvier 2011 qui donnait \u00e0 la demanderesse l\u2019autorisation de demander imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une date d\u2019audience. N\u00e9anmoins, je conclus que les dates de l\u2019audience devraient \u00eatre fix\u00e9es imm\u00e9diatement afin de permettre \u00e0 la demanderesse de demander l\u2019ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal, si elle le juge opportun, compte tenu de l\u2019audience qui sera tenue de fa\u00e7on imminente par la Cour.\n[7] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2010, le Tribunal avait demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9ciser si elles souhaitaient participer \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation \u00e9valuative. Toutes les parties avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 participer \u00e0 un tel processus. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait accept\u00e9 la m\u00e9diation \u00e9valuative \u00e0 condition que le Tribunal \u00e9mette aux parties une opinion non contraignante. Aucune date n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour la m\u00e9diation ni pour la pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries, la communication de la preuve ou l\u2019audition de la plainte.\n[8] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal leurs observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ajournement.\n[9] L\u2019argument invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate est essentiellement qu\u2019il est d\u00e9raisonnable de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal alors que la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera bient\u00f4t tranch\u00e9e. Sans un ajournement, si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est accueillie, il y aura une d\u00e9pense inutile de ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es caus\u00e9e par deux instances concomitantes. Si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est rejet\u00e9e, le temps qui se sera probablement \u00e9coul\u00e9 lors de l\u2019ajournement sera relativement court et ne causera pas de pr\u00e9judice aux parties.\n[10] L\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tant par la plaignante que par la Commission contre la requ\u00eate en ajournement est essentiellement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien \u00e0 ajourner pour l\u2019instant. De plus, m\u00eame si les dates sont \u00e9tablies pour l\u2019audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le d\u00e9roulement et l\u2019issue de cette proc\u00e9dure sont inconnus. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e en fonction des d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal dans des situations semblables. Il n\u2019y aurait pas de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ou \u00e0 la justice naturelle et les parties ne se verraient pas enlever la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve si l\u2019ajournement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accord\u00e9.\n[11] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal doit se faire sans formalisme et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Cependant, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de ses propres proc\u00e9dures, il peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il juge appropri\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir L\u00e9ger c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada [1999] D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en respectant les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, au paragraphe 17). Le Tribunal peut devoir tenir compte de questions de justice naturelle telles que la non-accessibilit\u00e9 de la preuve, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner pour trouver un avocat ou la communication tardive de la partie adverse.\n[12] Malgr\u00e9 le fait que des dates soient \u00e9tablies pour l\u2019audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, il n\u2019existe aucune certitude quant au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience ou \u00e0 l\u2019issue du processus. Pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 obtienne un ajournement, il doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il subirait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle si l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal poursuivait son cours normal. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019il subirait n\u00e9cessairement un tel pr\u00e9judice si je n\u2019accordais pas l\u2019ajournement.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante a dur\u00e9 environ neuf jours et s\u2019est termin\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine. L\u2019instance a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e pendant quelques mois pour donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le temps de r\u00e9soudre un probl\u00e8me technique quant \u00e0 la preuve sur bande vid\u00e9o.\n[2] Le 9 mars 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation du membre pr\u00e9sidant sur le fondement d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Les motifs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 comprenaient notamment :\n(i) Le fait que le membre pr\u00e9sidant, dans ses commentaires, ses ordonnances et son comportement pendant l\u2019audience, a soulev\u00e9 une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9;\n(ii) Le fait que le membre pr\u00e9sidant, en imposant des limites au contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante, a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De plus, l\u2019imposition de telles limites a entra\u00een\u00e9 une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[3] La plaignante et la Commission se sont oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et j\u2019ai entendu les observations des parties le 13 octobre 2010.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve, la jurisprudence et les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties au sujet de la requ\u00eate, je conclus que la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Je crois que mon comportement pendant l\u2019audience \u00e9tait judiciaire et impartial et qu\u2019il a permis aux parties d\u2019\u00eatre entendues de fa\u00e7on pleine et enti\u00e8re. En effet, avant que la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation ne soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, j\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00eat \u00e0 poursuivre l\u2019audience et j\u2019\u00e9tais engag\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner la preuve et les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en gardant l\u2019esprit ouvert.\n[5] Cependant, je sais que mon simple rejet de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation ne mettrait pas fin \u00e0 la question et qu\u2019il y aurait tr\u00e8s probablement d\u2019autres retards dans l\u2019affaire parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e demanderait in\u00e9vitablement \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de mon ordonnance. Selon le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait aussi interjeter appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[6] Pour cette raison, par les pr\u00e9sentes, j\u2019avise les parties que je me dessaisis de l\u2019affaire \u00e0 partir du jour suivant la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance et je vais demander \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de nommer un autre membre ou de constituer un autre tribunal pour l\u2019instruction de la plainte. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9cision est dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice. Elle pourrait d\u2019ailleurs donner l\u2019occasion aux parties de r\u00e9examiner d\u2019autres avenues de r\u00e9solution du conflit ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, de pr\u00e9ciser les questions en litige qui seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au nouveau d\u00e9cideur ou aux nouveaux d\u00e9cideurs que la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal nommera.\n[7] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 28 mars 2011\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1342\/7208\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Fallan Davis c.

Les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 des accommodements parce qu\u2019ils sont des personnes principalement responsables de personnes \u00e0 charge et que leur situation est telle que le temps de d\u00e9placement pour se rendre au travail \u00e0 tous les jours est, selon leurs all\u00e9gations, nuisible \u00e0 leur vie de famille.\n[3] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour instruction le 31 juillet 2009, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir communiqu\u00e9 par \u00e9crit avec les parties le 25 janvier 2011 et apr\u00e8s une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec les parties, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 de communiquer aux parties les documents mentionn\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1a), b) et c) de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces documents existent et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 les a en sa possession ou contr\u00f4le, sous r\u00e9serve de toute revendication de privil\u00e8ge que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse avoir au sujet de ces documents.\n[5] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 20 de ses observations du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2011 que les seuls documents au sujet desquels le Tribunal doit rendre une ordonnance pour la communication sont ceux demand\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1d) et e) de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[6] Pour plus de certitude, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de communiquer aux parties les documents demand\u00e9s par les demandeurs dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, soit les documents identifi\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1a), b) et c) de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnancem, sans d\u00e9lai.\n[7] Chaque partie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate en communication en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] Pour l\u2019essentiel, les observations des demandeurs au sujet de la communication par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des documents pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1d) et e) de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance sont les suivantes :\n[Traduction] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 notre demande de graphiques de structure hi\u00e9rarchique \u00e0 jour, ces renseignements sont essentiels pour notre cause parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans toutes ses lettres aux plaignants que toute permission de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et de bureau \u00e0 la carte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e en 2005. Il est \u00e9vident que ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Nous demandons ces documents pour prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni de tels accommodements en milieu de travail \u00e0 d\u2019autres groupes d\u2019employ\u00e9s; pourtant, il n\u2019accorde pas cet accommodement lorsqu\u2019il est demand\u00e9 pour des raisons de situation de famille.\nEn ce qui a trait \u00e0 notre demande d\u2019une copie non expurg\u00e9e du courriel entre Bill Woods et Tania Maidment du 3 janvier 2010, nous soutenons :\na) que derni\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que ce courriel est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat; cependant, il convient de noter que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a amplement eu l\u2019occasion de donner ce renseignement pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la CCDP et des plaignants et au Tribunal lorsque le document a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 en avril 2010.\nb) le document en question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par un avocat et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne peut pas \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat. Il est particuli\u00e8rement important de noter que ce document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour l\u2019objectif principal de recevoir un avis juridique ou de servir d\u2019appui dans le d\u00e9roulement d\u2019une instance et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il devrait faire partie du processus de communication.\n[9] Pour l\u2019essentiel, les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la requ\u00eate en communication des documents pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1d) et e) sont les suivantes :\nLes documents pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1d) visent d\u2019autres sections de bureaux au sein de RHDCC et ne comprennent pas de renseignements au sujet du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et du bureau \u00e0 la carte. Les documents ne sont donc pas pertinents quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si RHDCC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers les plaignants en raison de leur situation de famille. M\u00eame si les documents \u00e9voquaient le recours au t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et au bureau \u00e0 la carte dans d\u2019autres sections ou bureaux de RHDCC, ils ne seraient toujours pas pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, en particulier, quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la situation personnelle des plaignantes donne lieu \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation l\u00e9gitime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille.\nLe document mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1e) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce constitue une communication \u00e0 un avocat par l\u2019agent de RHDCC charg\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019accommodement des plaignantes. La communication a eu lieu pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle RHDCC \u00e9valuait la fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces demandes, dans le contexte d\u2019une instance pendante devant le Tribunal. RHDCC a soutenu avec raison qu\u2019il existait un privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat au sujet de ce document.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses arguments au sujet du privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat. Le 20 mars 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents r\u00e9vis\u00e9s au sujet du courriel mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1e) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui clarifiaient le fait que ce courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[10] Pour l\u2019essentiel, les observations de la Commission au sujet de la requ\u00eate en communication des documents pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 1d) et e) de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les suivantes :\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du TCDP est pertinent quant \u00e0 la question de la communication :\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\nDans l\u2019ordonnance au sujet de la communication dans l\u2019affaire Connie Bushey c. Arvind Sharma, 2003 TCDP 5, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli le principe directeur quant \u00e0 la communication :\n\u00ab (4) L\u2019intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019on ne lui ait communiqu\u00e9 aucune copie du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement conclu avec les syndicats. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne soit pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat et agisse en son propre nom, je crois comprendre qu\u2019il soutient avoir droit \u00e0 ce que ce document lui soit communiqu\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal. Ce paragraphe, s\u2019il est lu de concert avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d), oblige une partie \u00e0 fournir aux autres parties une copie de tous les documents en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en cause et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard consiste en fait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les documents en question sont \u201cpotentiellement pertinents\u201d \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019audience(1) \u00bb\nEn d\u2019autres mots, si l\u2019on peut pr\u00e9tendre que les documents demand\u00e9s sont pertinents quant aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la question des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats, les documents devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s.\nLes plaignants contestent aussi la qualification d\u2019un document \u00e0 titre de document prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat.\nLa Commission n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019opinion au sujet du document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge des communications entre client et avocat.\n[11] Bien que les documents mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1d) ne semblent pas, selon leur description, \u00eatre plus que des graphiques de type organisationnel, le fait que les demandeurs en ont demand\u00e9 la communication me porte \u00e0 croire qu\u2019ils pourraient aussi contenir des renseignements qui sont pertinents \u00e0 la cause. Par cons\u00e9quent, je souscris aux observations de la Commission et des demandeurs, susmentionn\u00e9es, qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre soutenu que les documents sont pertinents et, par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de communiquer ces documents aux parties sans d\u00e9lai.\n[12] Compte tenu des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fournis le 15 mars au sujet du document mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1e), il est clair que ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 souhaitait l\u2019utiliser dans le pr\u00e9sent litige. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accepte les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de ce document et j\u2019ordonne qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Joselito Silva, le plaignant, contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Postes Canada), l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans sa plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 6 janvier 2008, le plaignant a soutenu qu\u2019en juin 2007, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 titre d\u2019employeur, a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en le d\u00e9favorisant en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de sa situation de famille, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les doits de la personne (la Loi). En particulier, le plaignant a soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui avait refus\u00e9 une promotion \u00e0 un poste de superviseur pour lequel il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, en raison de deux griefs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que deux de ses s\u0153urs, qui sont aussi des employ\u00e9es de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, avaient entrepris avec succ\u00e8s contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur la plainte, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n[3] La Commission ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\nII. Les conclusions de fait [4] Le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e au centre de traitement de courrier de Calgary en 1998 \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 occasionnel pour No\u00ebl. Il est ensuite devenu un employ\u00e9 temporaire et, finalement, en 2002, il est devenu un employ\u00e9 permanent de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour laquelle il travaille actuellement \u00e0 titre de commis des postes syndiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 plein temps \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement postal. M. Greg Beauchamp du Service de ressources humaines de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a embauch\u00e9 le plaignant.\n[5] Le plaignant est arriv\u00e9 au Canada en 1987 des Philippines, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 et a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en g\u00e9nie civil de l\u2019Institut de technologie des Philippines en 1986. Avant de travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il avait occup\u00e9 plusieurs emplois, y compris des emplois avec Nortel Networks et Stanley Associates Engineering. Il a suivi divers cours d\u2019autoperfectionnement depuis son arriv\u00e9e au Canada. Il a aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 diverses activit\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9voles dans sa communaut\u00e9. Au fil des ans, il a fourni du soutien \u00e0 divers membres de sa famille en plus de sa famille imm\u00e9diate.\n[6] En 2004, le plaignant a suivi le Programme de perfectionnement en leadership de Postes Canada. Ce programme est un programme de leadership pour les employ\u00e9s internes de Postes Canada. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un programme de trois jours qui est offert de temps \u00e0 autre. Les candidats demandent \u00e0 y participer avec l\u2019appui de leur superviseur. Le programme est men\u00e9 par un animateur et un certain nombre de gestionnaires (habituellement cinq) de l\u2019intim\u00e9e provenant de divers services qui agissent \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9valuateurs, observant les participants au cours du programme et \u00e9valuant leur rendement dans les t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es. Le programme exige que les participants effectuent des t\u00e2ches en groupes, qu\u2019ils fassent des pr\u00e9sentations et qu\u2019ils participent \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s la participation du plaignant au Programme de perfectionnement en leadership de 2004, les \u00e9valuateurs ont conclu, \u00e0 partir des observations qu\u2019ils avaient recueillies lors du programme, que le plaignant n\u2019obtiendrait pas de poste de supervision. Trois des \u00e9valuateurs qui assistaient au programme, y compris M. Greg Beauchamp du Service des relations avec les employ\u00e9s, ont fourni au plaignant une r\u00e9troaction sur son rendement lors du programme. Pendant la s\u00e9ance de r\u00e9troaction avec les \u00e9valuateurs, le plaignant a avis\u00e9s ceux-ci qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait travailler en techniques du g\u00e9nie. On lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de communiquer avec le gestionnaire responsable de l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des processus op\u00e9rationnels afin qu\u2019il puisse travailler dans le domaine des techniques du g\u00e9nie selon ses int\u00e9r\u00eats, si c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 sa pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence r\u00e9elle, plut\u00f4t que de devenir un superviseur dans son secteur. On a aussi fourni au plaignant une r\u00e9troaction au sujet de ses capacit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de communication et de ses aptitudes en anglais. On l\u2019a avis\u00e9 que, sur ces deux points, il avait besoin d\u2019am\u00e9lioration afin de pouvoir devenir un superviseur, dont les t\u00e2ches comprennent la tenue de r\u00e9unions avec des employ\u00e9s pour les diriger.\n[8] Mme Magdalena Silva est la s\u0153ur du plaignant. Elle a obtenu une offre d\u2019emploi par lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en novembre 2005, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test d\u2019aptitudes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et, qu\u2019en raison de son r\u00e9sultat, elle n\u2019aurait pas satisfait aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est rendue compte de cette erreur, l\u2019offre a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e. M. Beauchamp a \u00e9crit une lettre en date du 18 novembre 2005 \u00e0 Mme Silva pour mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Mme Silva a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief au sujet du retrait de l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi et l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue avant l\u2019arbitrage : Mme Silva a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme employ\u00e9e permanente en juin 2006, et sa date de d\u00e9but de service continu a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 novembre 2005.\n[9] Mme Rosalyn Trudel est aussi la s\u0153ur du plaignant. Mme Trudel a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en novembre 2005 pour la p\u00e9riode de No\u00ebl et a obtenu un horaire de travail. Lorsque ses renseignements personnels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits dans le syst\u00e8me informatique du personnel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, certaines divergences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvertes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son nom marital (Trudel) et \u00e0 son nom de jeune fille (Silva). Lorsque ces divergences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvertes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Trudel. Cela a eu lieu quelques jours avant la date \u00e0 laquelle elle devait se pr\u00e9senter pour son premier quart de travail. M. Beauchamp a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Trudel en date du 10 novembre 2005 pour confirmer son emploi temporaire aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, puis lui a \u00e9crit une lettre en date du 24 novembre 2005 pour mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief au sujet du retrait de l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi et du cong\u00e9diement. Une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en arbitrage en sa faveur. Mme Trudel a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie dans ses fonctions et sa date de service continu aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 novembre 2005.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur, Rosalyn Trudel, le 24 novembre 2005, apr\u00e8s que celle\u2011ci eut re\u00e7u sa lettre de cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beauchamp le 25 novembre 2005 pour lui poser des questions au sujet du cong\u00e9diement de sa s\u0153ur. M. Beauchamp a refus\u00e9 de fournir au plaignant des renseignements parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019information privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e personnelle et priv\u00e9e qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le droit de divulguer au plaignant en vertu des politiques et des lois en mati\u00e8re de protection des renseignements personnels. Le plaignant \u00e9tait agit\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s m\u00e9content pendant cet appel.\n[11] \u00c0 partir de 2006 et pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte du plaignant en juin 2007, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a lanc\u00e9 un programme afin d\u2019augmenter de fa\u00e7on importante le nombre de superviseurs dans ses \u00e9tablissements au Canada. Afin de pouvoir g\u00e9rer l\u2019augmentation de la charge de travail pour cette mesure de dotation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a embauch\u00e9 le fournisseur Spherion Corporation (Spherion) pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 mener son programme de recrutement national de superviseurs. Tant les candidats internes qu\u2019externes pouvaient pr\u00e9senter leur candidature directement \u00e0 Spherion pour participer au processus de placement pour la formation des superviseurs.\n[12] En janvier 2006, le plaignant a de nouveau pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste de superviseur dans son secteur de travail aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucun changement dans son curriculum vitae depuis sa derni\u00e8re candidature en 2004.\n[13] Plus tard en 2006, le plaignant a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre concours pour un poste de superviseur aupr\u00e8s de Spherion. \u00c0 l\u2019issue du processus comportant un examen en ligne et une entrevue en personne, le plaignant n\u2019a pas atteint la note de passage minimale de 70 % requise pour avancer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante du processus.\n[14] Toujours en juin 2007, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste de superviseur pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de Spherion. Il a trait\u00e9 avec Mme Leanne Nichol de Spherion pendant ce processus.\n[15] Le processus de recrutement de Spherion comprend un questionnaire de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, un examen en ligne (dactylographie, connaissances en informatique, personnalit\u00e9 et comp\u00e9tences langagi\u00e8res), une entrevue de comportement en personne et une \u00e9valuation \u00e9crite, une v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, suivie d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me entrevue aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, si celle\u2011ci est justifi\u00e9e par l\u2019obtention de la note de passage minimale de 70 % dans le cadre du processus men\u00e9 par Spherion.\n[16] Les candidats \u00e9taient port\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Mme Nichol de diverses fa\u00e7ons. Les candidats pouvaient pr\u00e9senter leur candidature directement \u00e0 Spherion par un processus d\u2019affichage public, ou leur candidature pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la division temporaire de Spherion, ou les candidats pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s directement \u00e0 Spherion par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De temps en temps, la personne\u2011ressource de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Diana Cheys, du Service de ressources humaines, ou un autre superviseur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, r\u00e9f\u00e9rait un candidat interne de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nichol et lui fournissaient directement le curriculum vitae du candidat. Peu importe de quelle fa\u00e7on la candidature \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le candidat devait suivre le m\u00eame processus et participer aux m\u00eames examens aupr\u00e8s de Spherion.\n[17] En 2007, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature directement \u00e0 Spherion apr\u00e8s avoir vu une affiche sur le forum d\u2019emploi public. \u00c0 moins d\u2019en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e par le plaignant lui\u2011m\u00eame, ni Mme Cheys ni toute autre personne li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019aurait su que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature par le forum d\u2019emploi public, parce que Spherion ne donne pas les noms des candidats \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation des candidatures.\n[18] L\u2019examen en ligne de Spherion est effectu\u00e9 sur des logiciels s\u00e9curis\u00e9s, soit Proveit et Prevue Systems, qui sont con\u00e7us afin d\u2019\u00eatre impartiaux \u00e0 tout candidat qui subit l\u2019examen. Les examens sont attribu\u00e9s par des organismes de dotation et ne sont pas accessibles \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 toute autre organisation. Les organisations pour lesquelles Spherion effectue du recrutement (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e) ciblent les types d\u2019examens et d\u2019\u00e9valuations que les candidats ont \u00e0 effectuer pour le poste \u00e0 combler. Lorsqu\u2019un candidat a termin\u00e9 l\u2019examen, Mme Nichol re\u00e7oit un avis du bureau chef de Spherion afin de pouvoir obtenir l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux r\u00e9sultats. Les logiciels sont utilis\u00e9s par diverses agences de dotation et pour divers objectifs de recrutement, en plus du recrutement pour le poste de superviseur imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Pour le programme de recrutement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le r\u00f4le de Mme Nichol \u00e9tait de faire passer aux candidats les examens, les \u00e9valuations et l\u2019entrevue et d\u2019appuyer tout candidat qui obtenait la note de passage minimale de 70 % pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e re\u00e7oive le candidat pour une autre entrevue.\n[19] Mme Nichol a communiqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois avec le plaignant dans le cadre de la demande qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Spherion en juin 2007, lorsque le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour obtenir un poste de superviseur imm\u00e9diat pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Mme Nichol n\u2019avait aucune connaissance des demandes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du plaignant ni des r\u00e9sultats de toute pr\u00e9sentation et \u00e9valuation de candidature pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Le 6 juin 2007, le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation en ligne de son comportement, et il a obtenu une note de 66 %. Le plaignant a obtenu des notes moyennes pour son \u00e9valuation des connaissances informatiques, qui a aussi eu lieu le 6 juin. Les \u00e9valuations en ligne du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9taient qu\u2019une partie du processus et n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisantes pour exempter le plaignant du reste du processus; par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Nichol ne pouvait pas d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant r\u00e9ussirait le processus ou non en fonction des \u00e9valuations en ligne. Mme Nichol devait tenir une entrevue en personne afin de d\u00e9terminer le potentiel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du plaignant pour le poste et elle a laiss\u00e9 des messages sur la bo\u00eete vocale du plaignant l\u2019invitant \u00e0 une entrevue en personne imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut termin\u00e9 ses examens en ligne. Ses messages \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s enthousiastes. Le plaignant a suppos\u00e9 de ces messages que sa candidature serait retenue, bien que rien n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit \u00e0 ce sujet dans les messages de Mme Nichol.\n[20] Le plaignant a eu une entrevue en personne avec Mme Nichol le 7 juin 2007 et a subi une \u00e9valuation \u00e9crite au bureau de Spherion avant l\u2019entrevue. Mme Nichol avait pour habitude de ne pas dire au candidat au cours de l\u2019entrevue s\u2019il serait recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour une autre entrevue, parce que cela ne pouvait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 tant que l\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue et l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9crite du plaignant, Mme Nichol a calcul\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations en ligne et les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9valuations sur place du plaignant.\n[21] Le r\u00e9sultat du plaignant \u00e9tait en de\u00e7\u00e0 de la note de passage. Mme Nichol a fait de son mieux pour trouver un sc\u00e9nario valable selon lequel elle pourrait donner au plaignant la note de passage de 70 % requise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour qu\u2019un candidat du processus de Spherion puisse \u00eatre recommand\u00e9 pour la prochaine \u00e9tape du processus, soit l\u2019entrevue aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cependant, Mme Nichol ne pouvait pas donner au plaignant cette note et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019a pas atteint la note minimale de 70 %. Mme Nichol se souvient que le r\u00e9sultat se situait aux environs de 65 %. Mme Cheys se souvient que Mme Nichol lui a dit que le r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait de 66 %. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli une note de passage de 70 % pour le processus de Spherion pour tous les candidats. Mme Nichol a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien que, de temps en temps, elle ait tent\u00e9 d\u2019encourager l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir en entrevue des candidats, y compris le plaignant, qui avaient obtenu une note pr\u00e8s de la note de passage de 70 %, ces tentatives n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fructueuses. Elle a reconnu que Spherion \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 pour le recrutement des candidats retenus, cependant, les seuls candidats \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante \u00e9taient ceux qui obtenaient une note minimale de 70 %.\n[22] Mme Nichol a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la candidature du plaignant et de son \u00e9valuation qui ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res. Mme Nichol a exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cheys des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet d\u2019une barri\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re de communications et de langues qu\u2019elle croyait avoir d\u00e9cel\u00e9e chez le plaignant. Mme Cheys a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Nichol de fournir des recommandations au plaignant pour des cours d\u2019anglais langue seconde afin qu\u2019il am\u00e9liore ses aptitudes en communications, pour que sa candidature soit retenue pour un poste de supervision \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Mme Nichol a recommand\u00e9 au plaignant divers programmes d\u2019anglais langue seconde \u00e0 Calgary qui pourraient l\u2019int\u00e9resser.\n[23] Bien que le plaignant ait re\u00e7u une r\u00e9troaction positive de l\u2019entrevue, il n\u2019a pas atteint la note minimale de 70 % pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation compl\u00e8te et il ne pouvait donc pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante du processus. Le plaignant avait eu l\u2019impression lors de son entrevue aupr\u00e8s de Mme Nichol qu\u2019il participerait \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Bien que la preuve montre que Mme Nichol avait discut\u00e9 avec Mme Cheys et souhaitait que, puisque le plaignant avait une note pr\u00e8s de la note de passage, il puisse passer \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape, Mme Nichol n\u2019a rien fait pour recommander que la note de passage minimale soit \u00e9limin\u00e9e et Mme Nichol n\u2019a jamais dit ou \u00e9crit au plaignant qu\u2019il serait re\u00e7u en entrevue par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[24] Sauf pour l\u2019entrevue au sujet du comportement, quelques appels brefs au plaignant et des courriels au plaignant l\u2019avisant qu\u2019il ne proc\u00e9derait pas \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape du processus, Mme Nichol n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019autre interaction avec le plaignant au sujet de sa candidature aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour un poste de supervision.\n[25] Au cours du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation que Mme Nichol a effectu\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du plaignant, cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a jamais eu de renseignements ou de pr\u00e9occupations au sujet des membres de la famille du plaignant. De plus, le t\u00e9moignage non contredit de Mme Nichol \u00e9tait que M. Daryl Pinto et M. Prakash John, qui \u00e9taient des candidats pour le poste de supervision au m\u00eame moment que le plaignant, ont tous les deux obtenu une note sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la note de passage, contrairement \u00e0 ce que le plaignant croit \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[26] Mme Cheys a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne savait rien des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents des s\u0153urs du plaignant avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e avant que l\u2019\u00e9valuation soit termin\u00e9e et qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit prise au sujet de la candidature du plaignant. Mme Cheys a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la candidature du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de Spherion n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas obtenu la note de passage de 70 % et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une r\u00e8gle formelle \u00e0 laquelle elle ne pouvait d\u00e9roger. Mme Cheys a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais emp\u00each\u00e9 la candidature du plaignant d\u2019avancer en raison de pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de ses s\u0153urs. Mme Cheys a aussi confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nichol selon lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne recevait pas en entrevue un candidat qui avait obtenu moins de 70 %, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de le faire.\n[27] Apr\u00e8s le rejet de la candidature du plaignant en juin 2007 par Spherion, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 l\u2019appui de son superviseur, Rick Watson, qui avait travaill\u00e9 avec lui auparavant chez Nortel. M. Watson a envoy\u00e9 une demande au directeur, Tom Dixon, lui posant des questions au sujet du processus de dotation pour le poste de superviseur. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Mme Cheys, qui l\u2019a fait parvenir \u00e0 M. Beauchamp. Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rencontrer le plaignant pour lui expliquer pourquoi sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue pour le poste de superviseur.\n[28] Cette rencontre a eu lieu le 20 juin 2007. Pendant la rencontre, Mme Cheys et M. Beauchamp ont expliqu\u00e9 au plaignant que l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue \u00e9tait qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences en anglais, parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un point tr\u00e8s important dans les interactions d\u2019un superviseur avec ses employ\u00e9s dans le milieu de travail.\n[29] Pendant la rencontre du 20 juin 2007, M. Beauchamp a expliqu\u00e9 au plaignant des pr\u00e9occupations qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eues \u00e0 son sujet en 2005 quant \u00e0 sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019embauche au sujet de ses s\u0153urs, Rosalyn Trudel et Magdalena Silva. L\u2019incident auquel M. Beauchamp a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence avait eu lieu en novembre 2005, lorsque le plaignant avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beauchamp pour lui demander pourquoi ses s\u0153urs n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. M. Beauchamp avait avis\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de renseignements personnels au sujet de ses s\u0153urs et qu\u2019en raison des lois en mati\u00e8re de protection des renseignements personnels, le plaignant ne pouvait pas avoir acc\u00e8s aux renseignements, peu importe son lien de parent\u00e9 avec les personnes concern\u00e9es. Pendant cette conversation de novembre 2005, le demandeur \u00e9tait devenu tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9 et avait insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019on lui donne des renseignements personnels au sujet des membres de sa famille.\n[30] Pendant la rencontre du 20 juin 2007 avec le plaignant et Mme Cheys, M. Beauchamp a utilis\u00e9 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au comportement pass\u00e9 du plaignant en 2005 \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple de l\u2019une de ses lacunes au niveau des comp\u00e9tences pour illustrer que, si c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le plaignant se comportait lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait des membres de sa famille, comment le plaignant se comporterait\u2011il en milieu de travail si une situation semblable se pr\u00e9sentait. Le plaignant divulguerait\u2011il de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e des renseignements personnels, ou deviendrait\u2011il agit\u00e9 et insisterait\u2011il pour qu\u2019on lui fournisse des renseignements qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le droit de demander? Les superviseurs ont un acc\u00e8s aux renseignements confidentiels et personnels des employ\u00e9s qu\u2019ils supervisent et il \u00e9tait important pour M. Beauchamp que le plaignant reconnaisse les exigences des superviseurs lorsqu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 composer avec un employ\u00e9 qui vit une situation difficile et qu\u2019il reconnaisse que les superviseurs doivent \u00eatre discrets et savoir de quelle fa\u00e7on utiliser et prot\u00e9ger les renseignements confidentiels et personnels. Cependant, le plaignant a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de M. Beauchamp comme un signe clair qu\u2019il rappelait au plaignant le fait que ses s\u0153urs avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des griefs au sujet de leurs cong\u00e9diements par le pass\u00e9 et que c\u2019\u00e9tait pour cette raison qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas obtenu de promotion. Je suis d\u2019avis que le plaignant a mal compris la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et que l\u2019intention de M. Beauchamp \u00e9tait d\u2019utiliser cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence comme un exemple des lacunes au niveau des comp\u00e9tences du plaignant, et non de fa\u00e7on punitive ou discriminatoire.\n[31] En ce qui a trait aux candidatures du plaignant dans le processus de Spherion, M. Beauchamp n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans les processus de candidature ou de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection de Spherion. La seule participation de M. Beauchamp \u00e0 la candidature du plaignant en juin 2007 a \u00e9t\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant avec Mme Cheys le 20 juin 2007. Apr\u00e8s 2005, M. Beauchamp n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 avec Magdalena Silva ou Rosalyn Trudel.\n[32] Au moment de l\u2019audience, Mme Nichol ne travaillait plus pour Spherion, Mme Cheys ne travaillait plus pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et M. Beauchamp avait pris sa retraite et ne travaillait plus pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIII. Le droit A. \u00c9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination [33] L\u2019article 7 de la Loi dispose ce qui suit\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nLa situation de famille est un motif de distinction illicite au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi.\n[34] Le premier fardeau revient au plaignant, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) et O\u2019Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, et Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204.)\nB. Renversement du fardeau de la preuve et justification [35] Une fois que la preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve incombe par la suite \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui doit montrer, par des explications raisonnables (qui ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des pr\u00e9textes), que l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas produit tel qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l\u2019unique raison de l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la discrimination ne soit que l\u2019une des raisons de l\u2019acte ou de la d\u00e9cision. (Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 4; LCDP, article 15.) Voir aussi Canada c. Lambie, 1996 CanLii 3940 (C.F.).\nIV. Les questions en litige [36] Deux questions doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n(1) Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille ?\n(2) L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable qui ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 la discrimination ?\nV. Analyse et conclusions [37] La preuve du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e du t\u00e9moignage de ses deux s\u0153urs, Magdalena Silva et Rosalyn Trudel, ainsi que de son propre t\u00e9moignage. De plus, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve divers documents.\n[38] Bien que les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Silva et de Mme Trudel aient confirm\u00e9 leurs cong\u00e9diements, leurs griefs et leurs r\u00e9tablissements tels que mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a fourni de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas obtenu de promotion au poste de superviseur dans le processus de Spherion en juin 2007 \u00e9tait li\u00e9 d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on \u00e0 elles ou \u00e0 leurs griefs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents.\n[39] La preuve du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9ussi le processus de Spherion justifiant une entrevue aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En fait, il a produit des documents, sous forme de copies de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des \u00e9tapes d\u2019examen du processus, qui montrent qu\u2019il avait obtenu 66 %, ce qui est plus bas que la note de passage de 70 % requise pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante. Il n\u2019a pas fourni de preuve qui montrait que d\u2019autres candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de superviseur alors qu\u2019ils avaient obtenu une note g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de moins de 70 %.\n[40] Le plaignant avait suppos\u00e9 de sa conversation et de ses courriels avec Mme Nichol le 6 juin 2007 qu\u2019il avait assez bien r\u00e9ussi dans son entrevue avec elle pour remonter sa note g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au\u2011dessus de la note de passage de 70 %. Cependant, il a reconnu en contre\u2011interrogatoire que ni Mme Nichol, ni personne d\u2019autre ne lui avaient r\u00e9ellement dit ou \u00e9crit qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9ussi cette \u00e9tape et qu\u2019il aurait une entrevue avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a reconnu que Mme Nichol l\u2019avait avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui manquait certaines aptitudes n\u00e9cessaires pour se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante et qu\u2019il avait besoin de plus de formation dans ces domaines.\n[41] Au sujet de la conversation du 25 novembre 2005 portant sur le cong\u00e9diement des s\u0153urs du plaignant, le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tellement diff\u00e9rent de celui de M. Beauchamp. Le plaignant \u00e9tait m\u00e9content au sujet des cong\u00e9diements et il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beauchamp, qui a refus\u00e9 de discuter de la question en raison du fait qu\u2019il devait prot\u00e9ger les renseignements personnels des s\u0153urs du plaignant.\n[42] Le plaignant avait l\u2019impression que Mme Cheys et M. Beauchamp avaient eu une influence n\u00e9gative sur le r\u00e9sultat de sa candidature aupr\u00e8s de Spherion en juin 2007 en raison des griefs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de ses s\u0153urs. Cependant, il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve pour confirmer la validit\u00e9 de son impression \u00e0 ce sujet. Il a reconnu, en contre\u2011interrogatoire, que ni Mme Cheys ni M. Beauchamp n\u2019avaient particip\u00e9 au processus de Spherion, sauf pour la discussion qui a eu lieu entre Mme Nichol et Mme Cheys apr\u00e8s la fin des examens et de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du comportement par Mme Nichol. Il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve que Mme Nichol l\u2019avait recommand\u00e9 pour une entrevue aupr\u00e8s de Mme Cheys parce qu\u2019il aurait obtenu la note de passage de 70 %.\n[43] Mme Cheys ne savait rien des griefs pass\u00e9s des s\u0153urs du plaignant avant de rencontrer le plaignant et M. Beauchamp, apr\u00e8s que le plaignant eut appris que sa candidature \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s clair qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais annul\u00e9 l\u2019exigence de la note de passage de 70 % pour qu\u2019un candidat soit retenu.\n[44] Ni Mme Cheys ni M. Beauchamp n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9s dans le processus de dotation du poste de superviseur de juin 2007 du plaignant, avant que celui-ci n\u2019obtienne un r\u00e9sultat inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la note de passage dans les examens et les entrevues de Spherion. Ils n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9s dans le processus que lorsqu\u2019ils ont rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant le 20 juin 2007. Pendant cette rencontre, ils ont essay\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer au plaignant pourquoi sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue et ont essay\u00e9 de l\u2019encourager \u00e0 combler ses lacunes.\n[45] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication compl\u00e8te et raisonnable (qui n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9texte) au sujet de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[46] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Elle soutient qu\u2019entre juin 2006 et le 25 ao\u00fbt 2006, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans le cadre de son emploi en ne l\u2019embauchant pas au poste de contrema\u00eetre, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9d\u00e2t les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences que les hommes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019eux dans le domaine. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe parce qu\u2019elle l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi. La plaignante est une d\u00e9bardeuse qui travaille pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, chargeant et d\u00e9chargeant des bateaux de croisi\u00e8re au port de Vancouver.\n[3] Le 29 juillet 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte. La Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen, \u00e0 partir de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, concernant l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 30 ao\u00fbt 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son avis de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (dossier T\u20111388\u201110). L\u2019audience de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 15 mars 2011.\n[5] La Cour a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 15 avril 2011. Le juge Russell, dans sa d\u00e9cision, a conclu que la plaignante ne poss\u00e9dait pas toutes les qualifications exig\u00e9es pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre. Au paragraphe 67, le juge Russell a affirm\u00e9 :\nEn n\u00e9gligeant cet aspect, l\u2019enqu\u00eateure a commis une erreur de fait fondamentale qui rend d\u00e9raisonnable sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au tribunal pour cause de refus d\u2019accorder une promotion.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 en partie la plainte et la d\u00e9cision de la Commission rendue le 27 juillet 2010 qui renvoyait la plainte, sauf pour ce qui suit, et je cite le juge Russell :\n2. La d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 27 juillet 2010 est annul\u00e9e, sous r\u00e9serve de ce qui suit :\na. a.la question des \u00ab entraves \u00e0 ses efforts en vue d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans des postes mobiles \u00bb pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e aux paragraphes 102 \u00e0 107 du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateure;\nb. la question du fait que la demanderesse \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9e de plus pr\u00e8s que les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin \u00bb mentionn\u00e9e aux paragraphes 108 \u00e0 115 du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateure\npeuvent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour qu\u2019elle fasse instruire la plainte sur ces deux seuls aspects;\n3. l\u2019aspect de la d\u00e9cision portant sur l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle discrimination syst\u00e9mique contre les femmes dans le processus de promotion est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission pour qu\u2019elle le fasse instruire par un autre enqu\u00eateur qui respectera l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, en vue d\u2019une nouvelle d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure de la Commission;\n[7] Le 3 juin 2011, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties, leur demandant de soumettre leurs observations \u00e9crites concernant la marche \u00e0 suivre dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[8] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal leurs observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate de la plaignante en ajournement.\n[9] L\u2019argument central invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e contre la requ\u00eate en ajournement est que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 claire : seules les deux questions mentionn\u00e9es plus haut seront instruites alors que la plainte au sujet de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique sera renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission pour une nouvelle enqu\u00eate. De plus, les all\u00e9gations restantes sont ind\u00e9pendantes et ne d\u00e9pendent pas de la nouvelle enqu\u00eate ni de la possibilit\u00e9 que la plainte concernant la discrimination syst\u00e9mique soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[10] L\u2019argument central pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la plaignante soutient que sans la preuve de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission en ce qui concerne la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, un pr\u00e9judice sera caus\u00e9. La plaignante soutient \u00e9galement que les audiences s\u00e9par\u00e9es des \u00ab deux \u00bb plaintes iraient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des buts du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les plaintes concernant les droits de la personne de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, parce que cela produirait \u00ab deux \u00bb audiences au cours desquelles il y aurait une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des preuves, des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires caus\u00e9s par les deux audiences et la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019incoh\u00e9rences dans les r\u00e9sultats.\n[11] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal doit se faire sans formalisme et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Cependant, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre chez lui, il peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il le juge appropri\u00e9, vu son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir L\u00e9ger c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada [1999] D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en respectant les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, au paragraphe 17).\n[12] Il y a pr\u00e9sentement seulement deux questions qui constituent la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Le fait qu\u2019il y aura une plainte renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission provenant de son enqu\u00eate au sujet de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique n\u2019est que conjecture pour le moment. Il est \u00e9galement possible que la Commission en vienne \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune pratique de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019issue de sa nouvelle enqu\u00eate.\n[13] Pr\u00e9sentement, il n\u2019existe aucune certitude quant au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue du processus effectu\u00e9 par la Commission. La Commission affirme ce qui suit dans ses observations \u00e9crites soumises le 10 juin 2011, \u00e0 la page 2 :\n[traduction] Je ne peux pas pr\u00e9dire, en ce moment, le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour un nouvel enqu\u00eateur d\u2019instruire la plainte, ou pour la Commission d\u2019arriver \u00e0 sa nouvelle d\u00e9cision.\n[14] Plusieurs ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre la pr\u00e9sentation initiale de la plainte, sa mise \u00e0 jour la plus r\u00e9cente et le moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal pour son instruction. Tout autre report irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[15] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans sa d\u00e9cision, n\u2019ordonne pas que l\u2019instruction des parties de la plainte qu\u2019elle a maintenues devrait \u00eatre suspendue en attendant le r\u00e9sultat de la nouvelle enqu\u00eate de la Commission. La cour a affirm\u00e9 que les deux all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans la plainte peuvent \u00eatre instruites en application de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[16] Pour que la plaignante obtienne un ajournement, elle doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle subirait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle si l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal poursuivait son cours normal.\n[17] La plaignante ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019elle subirait n\u00e9cessairement un tel pr\u00e9judice si je n\u2019accordais pas l\u2019ajournement.\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 7 juillet 2011\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1491\/3710\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Linda Marshall c.
