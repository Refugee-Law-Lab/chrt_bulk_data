Ms. Barrie was an employee of Canada Post Corporation (CPC) and had filed human rights complaints against both CPC and her union, the Association of Postal Officers of Canada (APOC). In January of 2015, Ms. Barrie participated in a mediation session conducted by a member of the Tribunal. Ms. Barrie accepted an offer from the Respondents and the minutes of settlement were approved in due course by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC or Commission) under s. 48 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). Upon receiving notice from the CHRC that it had approved the minutes of settlement, the Tribunal closed its files.\n[2] Ms. Barrie is self-represented and her Motion is not as clear as it could be in terms of the relief that is being sought. In the Motion she requests that she be, \u201creleased from the \u201cbinding\u201d Settlement Agreement\u2026\u201d and she requests an order for financial compensation similar to the request in her Statement of Particulars. I understand this to be a request that the Tribunal find that the settlement should be considered null and void in light of the circumstances surrounding its negotiation, which are outlined in her Motion, and that the case proceed to inquiry.\n[3] In her Reply to the submissions of the other parties, Ms. Barrie appears to amend her Motion by requesting, in the alternative, that the parties be ordered to return to mediation to renegotiate:\n\u201cBased on the Cawson v. Air Canada case law the respondents have provided if the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to overturn the signed Minutes of Settlement it should have the jurisdiction to send the parties back to mediation to renegotiate the issues in dispute.\u201d\n[4] For the reasons given below, the Tribunal dismisses the motion to re-open the case.\nI. Confidentiality\n[5] The Tribunal is prohibited from admitting and accepting into evidence privileged information by virtue of s. 50(4) of the CHRA. The Tribunal acknowledges that settlement privilege normally protects from disclosure and renders inadmissible the terms of settlement. However, in this ruling it will be necessary for the Tribunal to consider one particular term of the minutes of settlement which was raised in Ms. Barrie\u2019s Reply. Ms. Barrie disclosed what appears to be a standard term used in the template for minutes of settlement. Given that the complainant\u2019s motion impugned the validity of a final settlement, and the existence or scope thereof, the Tribunal accepted and considered the text of this standard term\u2014as well as other information about the settlement process\u2014pursuant to exceptions to settlement privilege (Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp., 2013 SCC 37, para. 19; Union Carbide Canada Inc. v. Bombardier Inc., 2014 SCC 35, para. 35.) The standard term, and certain other facts pertaining to the settlement process, will also be discussed in the ruling.\n[6] Apart from the forgoing, the Commission, APOC and CPC have all requested that the Tribunal issue a confidentiality order concerning any other terms of the minutes of settlement and I note that the mediation itself was governed by a confidentiality agreement to which all the parties agreed to be bound. Accordingly, with respect to all documents filed in connection with Ms. Barrie\u2019s motion, the Tribunal orders, pursuant to s. 52 of the CHRA, that they be treated as confidential and the parties are ordered not to disclose any documents filed or received in connection with Ms. Barrie\u2019s motion, except in any judicial review proceedings taken under the Federal Courts Act.\nII. Background\n[7] The complaints in this matter were filed with the Commission by the Complainant on April 29, 2013. On March 26, 2014, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the CHRA, the Commission requested the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaints. The first complaint is against CPC on the ground of age and alleges discrimination under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. The second is against the APOC on the ground of age and alleges discrimination under sections 9 and 10 of the CHRA. The Commission requested a single inquiry into the two complaints.\n[8] The parties eventually agreed to a voluntary mediation session conducted by a member of the Tribunal. At the mediation session, Ms. Barrie accepted an offer from the Respondents. Minutes of settlement were prepared and were signed by Ms. Barrie and the Respondents. Pursuant to s. 48(1) of the CHRA, copies of the minutes of settlement were forwarded to the CHRC for its approval or rejection.\n[9] As Ms. Barrie was not represented by counsel at the mediation session, she was afforded a 7 day \u201ccooling off\u201d period to reflect upon the agreement. It is a normal practice of the Tribunal to allow unrepresented parties to have this 7 day period during which to fully consider the settlement agreement and seek legal advice if they choose to do so. Unrepresented parties may withdraw their consent to the settlement agreement up until the expiration of the 7 days. In this case, Ms. Barrie used the 7 days to make further inquiries to the Respondents and CPC provided a response to her. On January 23, 2015, which was 7 days after the mediation session, Ms. Barrie advised the parties that she still agreed with the minutes of settlement.\n[10] On or about February 9, 2015, Ms. Barrie advised the Commission that she had changed her mind and that she no longer approved of the agreement set out in the minutes of settlement. Counsel for the Commission advised the other parties that Ms. Barrie had changed her mind.\n[11] On March 17, 2015, the Tribunal held a Case Management Conference call with all the parties. During this call, counsel for the Commission advised the other parties that the minutes of settlement had been submitted to the Acting Chief Commissioner of the CHRC for approval or rejection, but that Commission counsel had since withdrawn them from consideration after hearing that Ms. Barrie had changed her mind.\n[12] By letter dated March 27, 2015, counsel for the Commission proposed to the Respondents that they should submit their respective positions as to whether or not the terms of the settlement should be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection, given Ms. Barrie\u2019s withdrawal of agreement. The Respondents rejected the invitation to make submissions and insisted that the minutes of settlement be put before the Acting Chief Commissioner for approval or rejection forthwith.\n[13] By letter dated July 7, 2015, counsel for the Commission advised the Tribunal that the Commission had approved the minutes of settlement on May 6, 2015 and that the parties had been so advised on May 20, 2015. Thereafter, as per its usual practice, the Tribunal closed its file and the parties were so advised, in writing, on July 27, 2015. On August, 10, 2015, the Complainant filed the present motion.\nIII. Issues\nDoes the tribunal have jurisdiction to decide a dispute relating to the validity of a settlement agreement that has been approved by the Commission under s. 48 of the CHRA?\nIf the tribunal does have jurisdiction, has Ms. Barrie shown that the minutes of settlement should be considered null and void on the grounds that, according to her submissions;\nShe was under duress;\nThe Respondents misrepresented the facts and mediated in bad faith; and\nShe advised the other parties that she had changed her mind just 23 days after the minutes of settlement were signed.\nIV. Analysis\n1. Jurisdiction\n[14] As the jurisdiction of the Tribunal has been brought into question by the Commission\u2019s, CPC\u2019s and APOC\u2019s submissions, I will address this issue first. The Commission and the Respondents all submit that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to re-open Ms. Barrie\u2019s complaints, based on the Tribunal\u2019s recent decision in Cawson v. Air Canada 2015 CHRT 17. In Cawson, the complainant sought to re-open a complaint file that had been settled some time beforehand through the Tribunal\u2019s mediation process.\n[15] While the Tribunal does not have an explicit statutory mandate to conduct mediations, mediation is offered to parties on a voluntary basis with a view to assisting them in their attempts to arrive at a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter, and as an alternative to the generally lengthier, costlier and more formal hearing process. In order to guide the mediation process, the Tribunal requests all parties to sign a Mediation Agreement before the commencement of the mediation session, and unrepresented parties are also made aware of the 7 day cooling off rule.\n[16] The CHRA specifically contemplates the possibility of settlements being reached prior to the commencement of a hearing before the Tribunal:\n48. (1) When, at any stage after the filing of a complaint and before the commencement of a hearing before a Human Rights Tribunal in respect thereof, a settlement is agreed on by the parties, the terms of the settlement shall be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection.\n(2) If the Commission approves or rejects the terms of a settlement referred to in subsection (1), it shall so certify and notify the parties.\n(3) A settlement approved under this section may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court on application to that Court by the Commission or a party to the settlement.\n[17] Section 48 was considered by the Tribunal in Powell v. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. 2008 CHRT 43, a case where the respondent argued the Tribunal should close its file because, in its view, a settlement had been reached. In Powell, the Tribunal discussed how s. 48 affects the status of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry. At paragraph 10, it observed:\nThere is no indication that the Commission has either explicitly or tacitly approved the alleged settlement between Ms. Powell and UPS. Absent such approval, it cannot be said that there exists a settlement bringing about an end to the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the complaint.\n[18] In the Cawson case, the Tribunal had already been notified of the Commission\u2019s approval of the settlement reached between the parties. At paragraph 24 of the Cawson decision, Vice-chairperson Gupta expanded on the meaning of section 48 as follows:\nUnder the scheme of section 48 of the CHRA, the Commission\u2019s decision to approve the terms of a settlement has the effect of bringing an end to the human rights complaint and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over that complaint. It is also a decision that is subject to judicial review (see for example Johnson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FC 1021). Subsection 48(3) also provides for the Federal Court to resolve disputes over settlement agreements that have been approved by the Commission. Therefore, in my view, once a settlement agreement has been approved by the Commission, the Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to deal with the human rights complaint that is the subject of the settlement, nor does it have jurisdiction to deal with disputes regarding that settlement agreement.\n[19] It is reasonable for parties to have an expectation of finality when a settlement agreement is reached. If there could be no assurance of finality, there would be little incentive for parties to engage in the mediation process. I am also in agreement with the Tribunal\u2019s finding in Cawson, that once the Commission has approved the settlement under section 48 of the CHRA, the Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to hear the complaint. While I do not rely on the recent judgment of the Federal Court in Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) 2015 CF 1180, I would note that the aforementioned finding is consistent with that judgment.\n[20] The matter of finality, and the role of the Tribunal in connection therewith, are unfortunately raised somewhat ambiguously in the context of paragraph 9 of the minutes of settlement signed by Ms. Barrie and the Respondents. In her Reply to the Commission\u2019s and Respondents\u2019 submissions to her Motion, Ms. Barrie disclosed part of this paragraph. According to her Reply, Ms. Barrie views paragraph 9 as giving her \u201cthe right to re-open or re-mediate settlement.\u201d She argues that if the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to overturn the minutes of settlement, it has the jurisdiction to send the parties back to mediation to negotiate the issues in dispute.\n[21] For clarity, counsel for CPC disclosed the entirety of the paragraph and I have reproduced it below. As mentioned above, I admitted and accepted this information in accordance with exceptions to settlement privilege, and this is the only provision of the minutes of settlement not governed by the s.52 order for confidentiality in respect of the terms of settlement. Paragraph 9 reads as follows:\n\u201c9. Once the settlement has been approved by the Commission, in the event of a disagreement as to the proper implementation of one or more of the terms of the settlement, the parties agree to return to mediation to renegotiate the issues in dispute. The parties further agree that the amendment will be submitted to the Commission for approval pursuant to section 48 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the amendment will be subject to enforcement in the Federal Court in the same manner as the original agreement.\u201d\n[22] The Tribunal is never a party to minutes of settlement signed at one of its mediation sessions. Moreover, Tribunal members are not expected to participate at all in the drafting of such minutes. They do not request or retain a copy of the minutes of settlement.\n[23] The availability of mediation services provided by CHRT Member-mediators is a matter falling within the CHRT Chairperson\u2019s managerial and policy-making role (See CHRA s. 48.4(2); CHRT, Annual Report 2000, pp. 2-3, 5). The Tribunal\u2019s explanatory documents detailing its mediation procedures indicate that if a settlement arrived at through mediation is approved by the Commission, \u201cthe Tribunal proceedings will be discontinued\u201d (See CHRT, Evaluative Mediation Procedures, December 10, 2010, p. 9; CHRT, A Guide to Understanding the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, p. 20 [1] ).\n[24] Moreover, on two occasions (Powell and Cawson), the Tribunal has observed that approval of a settlement under s. 48 deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry. In view of the foregoing, the inclusion of a \u201creturn to mediation\u201d clause, such as paragraph 9 above, is potentially problematic. To the extent it suggests to parties that subsequent mediation by a Tribunal member is indefinitely available to deal with any subsequent disputes in the case arising from the settlement, such clause does not fully take into account the role and responsibilities of the CHRT Chairperson, the Tribunal\u2019s mediation procedures or Tribunal jurisprudence. For all of the above reasons, I conclude that paragraph 9 of the minutes of settlement does not grant Ms. Barry the right to re-open or re-mediate the settlement at the Tribunal.\n2. Minutes of Settlement Null & Void?\n[25] Having determined that it lacks jurisdiction, the Tribunal is not obliged to consider the second issue of contractual nullity due to duress, misrepresentation, bad faith and prompt withdrawal of consent. Nevertheless, the allegations will be addressed below in the event the Tribunal is found to have the jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.\na. Duress\n[26] Ms. Barrie has alleged that misinformation gave her the impression that she had no \u201crealistic alternative\u201d and therefore had to give up her complaint and sign the settlement agreement. She described the misinformation as \u201ca type of duress.\u201d The legal threshold for establishing duress has been set out by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Taber v. Paris Boutique & Bridal Inc., 2010 ONCA 157, at paras. 8-9:\nThere is no doubt that economic duress can serve to make an agreement unenforceable against a party who was compelled by the duress to enter into it. Nor is there any doubt that the party can have the agreement declared void on this basis.\nHowever, not all pressure, economic or otherwise, can constitute duress sufficient to carry these legal consequences. It must have two elements: it must be pressure that the law regards as illegitimate; and it must be applied to such a degree as to amount to \u201ca coercion of the will\u201d of the party relying on the concept\u2026\n[27] Ms. Barrie has not alleged any facts in support of her general assertion that she was being compelled to act against her will at the mediation. The submissions of CPC suggest that the parties were in separate rooms throughout the mediation session. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, Ms. Barrie benefitted from a 7 day period during which she was able to reflect upon her decision to settle at the mediation session. Even if she felt pressure at the time of the mediation session itself, Ms. Barrie would have had adequate time in the days following to reflect on the question of whether or not she truly wished to settle. As such, I cannot find that Ms. Barrie satisfies the test outlined in Taber, supra.\n[28] Furthermore, Ms. Barrie asserted that she had no other \u201crealistic alternative\u201d but to give up her complaint and sign the minutes of settlement. Ms. Barrie appears to rely on the mediator\u2019s alleged comment that there would be no guarantee as to the outcome of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry, should the matter proceed to a hearing. However, Ms. Barrie does not go so far as to say the mediator advised her that the outcome would be something less than what she was being offered through mediation. Members of the Tribunal are sometimes asked to give an evaluative assessment at mediation of a party\u2019s prospects, should the mediation fail and the matter go on to a hearing. It is implied, if not stated explicitly by the member each time, that their evaluation is speculative and not a guarantee of the inquiry outcome. Indeed, in the present case, Ms. Barrie is not suggesting any specific outcome was predicted, just that nothing could be guaranteed. In this context, I disagree with Ms. Barrie\u2019s assertion that she did not have a realistic alternative. She could have simply declined the offer and proceeded with her complaint in the context of a CHRT hearing.\nb. Misrepresentation \/ Bad Faith\n[29] Ms. Barrie alleges that the Respondents did not tell her \u201cthe whole truth\u201d at the mediation session and, as such, they misrepresented the facts and mediated in bad faith. Ms. Barrie cites the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario\u2019s decision in Wedderburn v. Air Liquide Canada 2010 HRTO 691 to support the premise that a contract may be set aside where one party has deliberately misled another to induce the latter into entering the agreement.\n[30] Wedderburn is also cited by the respondents, because it relied upon the Ontario Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in 1018429 Ontario Inc. v. Fea Investments Ltd., 1999 CanLII 1741 (ON CA). In this judgment, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of fraudulent misrepresentation, and at paragraph 51 cited Professor Fridman\u2019s description of this concept, taken from the The Law of Contract in Canada, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1994) at p. 294:\nA fraudulent misrepresentation is one which is made with knowledge that it is untrue and with the intent to deceive. It may even constitute a term of the contract. Whether it does or not is immaterial, since fraud gives rise to effects in the law of contract and the law of tort. A contract resulting from a fraudulent misrepresentation may be avoided by the victim of the fraud. In such instances the apparent consent by the innocent party to the contract and its terms, is not a real consent. Whether or not the effect of such fraud is to induce a mistake (which might render the contract void), the consent of the innocent party may be revoked at his option.\n[31] At issue in that case was whether a misrepresentation disclaimer in a contract could immunize a party from an award of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation. That is not the issue of main concern in the present case, but on the following page of his text, at p. 295, Professor Fridman provides a definitive description of fraudulent misrepresentation, setting out its essential elements:\nA fraudulent misrepresentation consists of a representation of fact made without any belief in its truth, with the intent that the person to whom it is made shall act upon it and actually causing that person to act upon it. In United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet (1909 A.C. 330 (P.C.)), the defendants wanted to raise the defence of fraudulent misrepresentation to an action for an injunction and damages based upon a contract under which the plaintiffs leased to the defendants machines for performing a certain process in the making of shoes. In the event, the Privy Council held that the defendants could not raise and rely on the defence because they had adopted and affirmed the contract despite the fraudulent misrepresentations. In holding that the defence had been made out, and would have operated had it not been for the subsequent conduct of the defendants, Lord Atkinson made it clear that to establish a case of false or fraudulent misrepresentation the following had to be established: (1) that the representations complained of were made by the wrongdoer to the victim; (2) that these representations were false in fact; (3) that the wrongdoer, when he made them, either knew that they were false or made them recklessly without knowing whether they were false or true; (4) that the victim was thereby induced to enter into the contract in question.\nSee also: Westwood Shipping Lines Inc. v. Geo International Inc., 1999 CanLII 7652 (FC), para. 10).\n[32] I find Lord Atkinson\u2019s four point test to be helpful in this matter. Regarding the second requirement of the test, the respondents argue that the disputed information was a statement of their legal position and not a statement of fact. However, it is not necessary for me to explore that issue, nor the third or fourth requirement under the test.\n[33] This argument fails because Ms. Barrie does not claim that the alleged misinformation was actually conveyed to her by the respondents. According to the submissions of the respondents, the parties were not in the same room at the mediation session and apparently did not speak to each other directly. Ms. Barrie alleges the Respondents told certain misinformation to the Tribunal\u2019s mediator who then relayed it to her, thus inducing her agreement. There is no dispute that there was no direct communication between Ms. Barrie and the Respondents at the mediation. The Respondents deny making the representation in question, and Ms. Barrie has no direct knowledge that they did in fact make it. Furthermore, it is certainly within the realm of possibility that there was a mistake or miscommunication in the relaying of verbal information through the mediator. Ms. Barrie\u2019s alleged facts cannot support a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation according to Lord Atkinson\u2019s test.\nc. Prompt Withdrawal\n[34] Upon re-reading the Statement of Particulars of APOC on or about February 9, 2015, Ms. Barrie realized that a state of facts she came to believe at the mediation session may not have been true. She immediately thereafter contacted the Commission to withdraw her consent to the terms of the settlement agreement.\n[35] The deadline for withdrawing her consent had been January 23, 2015. Ms. Barrie was well aware of the deadline, and had used the 7 day cooling off period to ask further questions of the Respondents. On the 7th day after the mediation, she advised all parties of her ongoing agreement with the minutes of settlement signed at the mediation session.\n[36] It is unfortunate that Ms. Barrie did not fully absorb the information in APOC\u2019s Statement of Particulars until February 9, 2015. Had she become aware of it earlier, she may very well have withdrawn her consent to the settlement terms, or not agreed to the settlement in the first place. However, the fact that she requested a withdrawal immediately upon her revelation is not grounds to set aside the minutes of settlement.\n[37] One of the imperative assurances of a mediated settlement is finality. The 7 day cooling off period was made clear to the parties and Ms. Barrie does not dispute that. If the Tribunal were to set aside the peremptory nature of the 7 day cooling off period on the grounds invoked in this one case, the integrity of its entire mediation process would be brought into question.\nV. Decision\n[38] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the motion.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 2 (the Decision), this Panel found the Complainants had substantiated their complaint that First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are denied equal child and family services, and\/or differentiated adversely in the provision of child and family services, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA).\n[2] The Panel generally ordered Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the First Nations Child and Family Services (FNCFS) Program and the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians applicable in Ontario (the 1965 Agreement) to reflect the findings in the Decision. INAC was also ordered to cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of the principle.\n[3] Given the complexity and far-reaching effects of these orders, the Panel requested further clarification from the parties on how these orders could best be implemented on a practical, meaningful and effective basis, both in the short and long term. It also requested further clarification with respect to the Complainants\u2019 requests for compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA. The Panel retained jurisdiction to deal with these outstanding issues following further clarification from the parties.\n[4] The Panel advised the parties it would address the outstanding questions on remedies in three steps. First, the Panel will address requests for immediate reforms to the FNCFS Program, the 1965 Agreement and Jordan\u2019s Principle. This is the subject of the present ruling.\n[5] Other mid to long-term reforms to the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement, along with other requests for training and ongoing monitoring will be dealt with as a second step. Finally, the Parties will address the requests for compensation under ss. 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA.\nII. Progress to date\n[6] INAC accepts the Decision and has not sought judicial review of its findings or general orders. It is committed to working with child and family services agencies; front-line service providers; First Nations organizations, leadership, and communities; the Complainants; and the provinces and territories, on steps towards program reform and meaningful change for children and families. It has also specifically committed to the following:\n\u00b7 A full-scale reform of its child welfare program.\n\u00b7 Review of the 1965 Agreement.\n\u00b7 Not to reduce or restrict funding to the FNCFS Program\n\u00b7 To immediately re-establish the National Advisory Committee.\n\u00b7 And, it supports the new iteration of the Canadian Incidence Study.\n[7] INAC\u2019s submissions also indicated that immediate relief in response to the Decision would include increased funding for the FNCFS Program. The 2016 federal budget allocated $634.8 million over five years for the FNCFS Program. According to INAC, $71.1 million is to be provided in 2016-2017 for the following:\n\u00b7 $54.2 million for:\no immediate adjustments to Operations and Prevention through additional investments to update existing funding agreements;\no increases to the per child service purchase amounts (including for prevention services);\no funding for intake and investigation services;\no upward adjustments for agencies with more than 6% of children in care; and,\no investments for providing federal support to expand provincial case management systems on reserve.\n\u00b7 $16.2 million for prevention funding in Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Yukon at nationally-consistent levels across all jurisdictions.\n\u00b7 $700,000 to INAC resources for outreach, engagement and effective allocation of funding to service providers.\n[8] In addition to the funding identified in the 2016 budget, INAC also commits to provide additional funding for:\n\u00b7 maintenance funding to respond to budgetary pressures created as a result of provincial legislative changes to service delivery requirements, as they arise; and\n\u00b7 support for an engagement process going forward in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee and Regional Tables to work on medium and long-term reform.\n[9] The Panel acknowledges the commitments made by the Federal government so far and is encouraged by its efforts to implement the Tribunal\u2019s orders.\nIII. Updated order\n[10] It is worth reiterating some of the Tribunal\u2019s remedial principles in order to foster a common understanding of the Panel\u2019s goals and authorities in crafting a remedy in response to the Decision.\n[11] Human rights legislation expresses fundamental values and pursues fundamental goals. In fact, the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed the quasi-constitutional nature of the CHRA on many occasions (see for example Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 SCR 84 at pp. 89-90 [Robichaud]; Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30 at para. 81; and Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 at para. 62 [Mowat]). In line with this special status, the CHRA must be interpreted in a broad, liberal and purposive manner so that the rights enunciated therein are given their full recognition and effect (see Mowat at paras. 33 and 62).\n[12] Likewise, when crafting a remedy following the substantiation of a complaint, the Tribunal\u2019s powers under section 53 of the CHRA must be interpreted so as to best ensure the objects of the Act are obtained. Pursuant to section 2, the purpose of the CHRA is to give effect to the principle that:\nall individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices\u2026\n[13] It is the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to consider this dominant purpose in crafting an order under section 53 of the CHRA. Consistent with that purpose, the aim in making an order under section 53 is not to punish the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice, but to eliminate and prevent discrimination (see Robichaud at para. 13; and CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 at p. 1134 [Action Travail des Femmes]).\n[14] On a principled and reasoned basis, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented, the Tribunal must ensure its remedial orders are effective in promoting the rights protected by the CHRA and meaningful in vindicating any loss suffered by the victim of discrimination (see Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50; Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62 at paras. 25 and 55; and Action Travail des Femmes at p. 1134).\n[15] That said, constructing effective and meaningful remedies to resolve a complex dispute, as is the situation in this case, is an intricate task. Indeed, as the Federal Court of Canada stated in Grover v. Canada (National Research Council) (1994), 24 CHRR D\/390 (FC) at para. 40 [Grover], \u201c[s]uch a task demands innovation and flexibility on the part of the Tribunal in fashioning effective remedies and the Act is structured so as to encourage this flexibility.\u201d\n[16] Aside from orders of compensation, this flexibility in fashioning effective remedies arises mainly from sections 53(2)(a) and (b) of the CHRA. Those sections provide the Tribunal with the authority to order measures to redress the discriminatory practice or prevent the same or similar practice from occurring in the future [see s. 53(2)(a)]; and to order that the victim of a discriminatory practice be provided with the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied [see s. 53(2)(b)].\n[17] The application of these broad remedial authorities can override an organization\u2019s right to manage its own enterprise and, with particular regard to section 53(2)(b), can afford the victim of a discriminatory practice a remedy in specific performance (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113 at paras. 165 and 167, varied on other grounds in Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2014 FCA 110; and Canada (Attorney General) v. McAlpine (1989), 12 CHRR D\/253 (FCA) at para. 6). In line with ensuring remedial orders are effective in promoting the rights it protects, section 53(2)(a) can also be used to craft remedies designed to educate individuals about the rights enshrined in the CHRA (see Schuyler v. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2006 CHRT 34 at paras. 166-170; and Robichaud v. Brennan (1989), 11 CHRR D\/194 (CHRT) at paras. 15 and 21).\n[18] With specific regard to the circumstances of this case, section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA has been described as being designed to meet the problem of systemic discrimination (see Action Travail des Femmes at p. 1138 referring to the CHRA, S.C. 1976-77, c. 33, s. 41(2)(a) [now s. 53(2)(a)]). To combat systemic discrimination, \u201cit is essential to create a climate in which both negative practices and negative attitudes can be challenged and discouraged\u201d (Action Travail des Femmes at p. 1139). That is, for the Tribunal to redress and prevent systemic discriminatory practices, it must consider any historical patterns of discrimination in order to design appropriate strategies for the future (see Action Travail des Femmes at p. 1141).\n[19] It is with these remedial principles in mind that the Panel approaches the task of continuing to craft an effective and meaningful order to address the discriminatory practices identified in the Decision.\nA. The FNCFS Program\n[20] The Panel\u2019s main findings with regard to the need to reform and redesign the FNCFS Program in the short and long term were summarized at paragraphs 384-389 (see also para. 458) of the Decision and include (emphasis added):\n[384] Under the FNCFS Program, Directive 20-1 has a number of shortcomings and creates incentives to remove children from their homes and communities. Mainly, Directive 20-1 makes assumptions based on population thresholds and children in care to fund the operations budgets of FNCFS Agencies. These assumptions ignore the real child welfare situation in many First Nations\u2019 communities on reserve. Whereas operations budgets are fixed, maintenance budgets for taking children into care are reimbursable at cost. If an FNCFS Agency does not have the funds to provide services through its operations budget, often times the only way to provide the necessary child and family services is to bring the child into care. For small and remote agencies, the population thresholds of Directive 20-1 significantly reduce their operations budgets, affecting their ability to provide effective programming, respond to emergencies and, for some, put them in jeopardy of closing.\n[385] Directive 20-1 has not been significantly updated since the mid-1990\u2019s resulting in underfunding for FNCFS agencies and inequities for First Nations children and families on reserves and in the Yukon. In addition, Directive 20-1 is not in line with current provincial child welfare legislation and standards promoting prevention and least disruptive measures for children and families. As a result, many First Nations children and their families are denied an equitable opportunity to remain with their families or to be reunited in a timely manner. In 2008, at the time of the Complaint, the vast majority of FNCFS Agencies across Canada functioned under Directive 20-1. At the conclusion of the hearing in 2014, Directive 20-1 was still applicable in three provinces and in the Yukon Territory.\n[386] AANDC incorporated some of the same shortcomings of Directive 20-1 into the EPFA, such as the assumptions about children in care and population levels, along with the fixed streams of funding for operations and prevention. Despite being aware of these shortcomings in Directive 20-1 based on numerous reports, AANDC has not followed the recommendations in those reports and has perpetuated the main shortcoming of the FNCFS Program: the incentive to take children into care - to remove them from their families.\n[387] Furthermore, like Directive 20-1, the EPFA has not been consistently updated in an effort to keep it current with the child welfare legislation and practices of the applicable provinces. Once EPFA is implemented, no adjustments to funding for inflation\/cost of living or for changing service standards are applied to help address increased costs over time and to ensure that prevention-based investments more closely match the full continuum of child welfare services provided off reserve. In contrast, when AANDC funds the provinces directly, things such as inflation and other general costs increases are reimbursed, providing a closer link to the service standards of the applicable province\/territory.\n[388] In terms of ensuring reasonably comparable child and family services on reserve to the services provided off reserve, the FNCFS Program has a glaring flaw. While FNCFS Agencies are required to comply with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards, the FNCFS Program funding authorities are not based on provincial\/territorial legislation or service standards. Instead, they are based on funding levels and formulas that can be inconsistent with the applicable legislation and standards. They also fail to consider the actual service needs of First Nations children and families, which are often higher than those off reserve. Moreover, the way in which the funding formulas and the program authorities function prevents an effective comparison with the provincial systems. The provinces\/territory often do not use funding formulas and the way they manage cost variables is often very different. Instead of modifying its system to effectively adapt it to the provincial\/territorial systems in order to achieve reasonable comparability; AANDC maintains its funding formulas and incorporates the few variables it has managed to obtain from the provinces\/territory, such as salaries, into those formulas.\n[389] Given the current funding structure for the FNCFS Program is not adapted to provincial\/territorial legislation and standards, it often creates funding deficiencies for such items as salaries and benefits, training, cost of living, legal costs, insurance premiums, travel, remoteness, multiple offices, capital infrastructure, culturally appropriate programs and services, band representatives, and least disruptive measures. It is difficult, if not impossible, for many FNCFS Agencies to comply with provincial\/territorial child and family services legislation and standards without appropriate funding for these items; or, in the case of many small and remote agencies, to even provide child and family services. Effectively, the FNCFS funding formulas provide insufficient funding to many FNCFS Agencies to address the needs of their clientele. AANDC\u2019s funding methodology controls their ability to improve outcomes for children and families and to ensure reasonably comparable child and family services on and off reserve. Despite various reports and evaluations of the FNCFS Program identifying AANDC\u2019s \u201creasonable comparability\u201d standard as being inadequately defined and measured, it still remains an unresolved issue for the program.\n[21] The Complainants and Commission requested INAC to immediately remove the most discriminatory aspects of the funding schemes it uses to fund FNCFS Agencies under the FNCFS Program; and, in response, the Panel ordered INAC to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the FNCFS Program to reflect the findings in the Decision. While the Panel did request clarification on certain remedial items and understood the Federal government may need some time to review the Decision and develop a strategy to address it, that was three months ago and there is still uncertainty amongst the parties and the Panel as to how the Federal government\u2019s response to the Decision addresses the findings above. The Panel appreciates that some reforms to the FNCFS Program will require a longer-term strategy; however, it is still unclear why or how some of the findings above cannot or have not been addressed within the three months since the Decision. Instead of being immediate relief, some of these items may now become mid-term relief.\n[22] Again, while it appreciates the Federal government\u2019s commitments and efforts to date, the Panel requires more clarity from INAC moving forward to ensure its orders are effectively and meaningfully implemented. As the Assembly of First Nations stated in its submissions; \u201c[a]n order for immediate relief to the FNCFS Program should be meaningful but temporary until such time that the FNCFS Program can be completely overhauled.\u201d The Panel agrees with this statement. To address this, the Panel believes the best course of action is for INAC to provide ongoing reporting to the Tribunal. That is, the Panel will supervise the implementation of its orders by way of regular detailed reports created by INAC, to which the parties will have an opportunity to provide submissions.\n[23] The Panel orders INAC to immediately take measures to address the items underlined above from the findings in the Decision. INAC will then provide a comprehensive report, which will include detailed information on every finding identified above and explain how they are being addressed in the short term to provide immediate relief to First Nations children on reserve. The report should also include information on budget allocations for each FNCFS Agency and timelines for when those allocations will be rolled-out, including detailed calculations of the amounts received by each agency in 2015-2016; the data relied upon to make those calculations; and, the amounts each has or will receive in 2016-2017, along with a detailed calculation of any adjustments made as a result of immediate action taken to address the findings in the Decision.\n[24] INAC is directed to provide this report within four weeks of this ruling. Following reception of the report, and given the length of time that has elapsed since the Decision, an in-person case management meeting will then occur to provide an opportunity for the parties and Panel to discuss the report, ask questions, and make submissions, if any. Thereafter, the Panel will issue a further ruling if necessary. The Tribunal will canvass the parties for dates for this case management meeting in the days following the release of this ruling.\n[25] The Panel recognizes that INAC provided additional information regarding its 2016 budget allocation for the FNCFS Program following the close of submissions for this ruling and invited the parties to meet to discuss the issue. The Complainants raised concerns with the timing and manner in which this information was sent to the Tribunal. Neither is interested in another round of submissions on the issue at this time. The Panel did not consider INAC\u2019s additional information regarding the 2016 budget as part of this ruling. However, in a much more detailed fashion, this information will presumably form part of the material to be included in the report to follow and the other parties will have an opportunity to provide submissions thereon.\nB. The 1965 Agreement\n[26] The Panel\u2019s main finding with regard to the 1965 Agreement was that it had not been updated to ensure on-reserve communities in Ontario could fully comply with the Child and Family Services Act, including the provision of Band Representatives and mental health services (see the Decision at paras. 217-246 and 458).\n[27] The Federal government has indicated that it has met with the Government of Ontario and expressed a need to review the 1965 Agreement. It submits these preliminary meetings have set the stage for more substantive discussions that will take place with First Nations.\n[28] Furthermore, following the Decision and while submissions were being filed in advance of this ruling, the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN) filed a motion seeking interested party status. NAN seeks to address the design and implementation of the Panel\u2019s orders with specific regard to the context of remote and northern communities in Ontario.\n[29] Notwithstanding NAN\u2019s motion, the Panel made a commitment to the parties to rule upon immediate relief items expeditiously and wanted to rule upon as many of those items as possible in this ruling. However, given the Panel will rule upon NAN\u2019s motion shortly following the release of this ruling and that there may be further submissions to consider on the 1965 Agreement, the Panel believes it would be more appropriate to address any immediate relief items with respect to the 1965 Agreement after receiving those further submissions from the parties.\nC. Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[30] In the Decision, the Panel found the Federal government\u2019s definition and implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle to be narrow and inadequate, resulting in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children. Namely, that delays were inherently build into the Federal government\u2019s process for dealing with potential Jordan\u2019s Principle cases and that it was unclear why the government\u2019s approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle cases focused on inter-governmental disputes in situations where a child has multiple disabilities, as opposed to all jurisdictional disputes (including between federal government departments) involving all First Nations children and not just those with multiple disabilities (see the Decision at paras. 379-382 and 458).\n[31] According to the Federal government, INAC and Health Canada have begun discussions on the process for expanding the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, improving its implementation and identifying other partners who should be involved in this process. Over the next two to three months, it will begin engaging First Nations and the provinces and territories in these discussions. It anticipates options for changes to Jordan\u2019s Principle could be developed within twelve months.\n[32] However, the Panel\u2019s order specifically indicated that INAC was to \u201c\u2026immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan's principle\u201d (the Decision at para. 481). While it understands a period of time may have been needed to meet with partners and stakeholders and put a framework in place, the Panel did not foresee this order would take more than three months to implement. The order is to \u201cimmediately implement\u201d, not immediately start discussions to review the definition in the long-term. There is already a workable definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that has been adopted by the House of Commons. While review of this definition and the Federal government\u2019s framework for implementing it may benefit from further long-term review, the Panel sees no reason why the current definition cannot be implemented now.\n[33] Therefore, the Panel orders INAC to immediately consider Jordan\u2019s Principle as including all jurisdictional disputes (this includes disputes between federal government departments) and involving all First Nations children (not only those children with multiple disabilities). Pursuant to the purpose and intent of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the government organization that is first contacted should pay for the service without the need for policy review or case conferencing before funding is provided.\n[34] INAC will report to the Panel within two weeks of this ruling to confirm this order has been implemented.\nD. Other issues\n[35] The Complainants made various other submissions with respect to implementing the Panel\u2019s orders in the short term. While some were addressed by INAC, others were not (see for example para. 16 of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society\u2019s submissions dated March 31, 2016; and paras. 12-15 of the Assembly of First Nations\u2019 submissions dated March 3, 2016). It would be helpful to the Panel and the parties if INAC could respond to those additional immediate relief items as part of its report on the FNCFS Program ordered above. Therefore, in its FNCFS Program report, the Panel directs INAC to address the immediate relief items sought by the Complainants that have not been addressed in INAC\u2019s submissions to date.\nE. Retention of jurisdiction\n[36] Remedial orders designed to address systemic discrimination can be difficult to implement and, therefore, may require ongoing supervision. Retaining jurisdiction in these circumstances ensures the Panel\u2019s remedial orders are effectively implemented (see Grover at paras. 32-33).\n[37] Given the ongoing nature of the orders above, and given the Panel still needs to rule upon other outstanding remedial requests, the Panel will continue to maintain jurisdiction over this matter. Any further retention of jurisdiction will be re-evaluated following the further reporting by INAC and the Panel\u2019s ruling on the other outstanding remedies.\nIV. Concluding remarks by Panel Chairperson\n[38] I wish to share some concluding remarks with the parties. Member Lustig has read and supports these remarks.\n[39] The hearings in this matter were held in a spirit of reconciliation, with an overarching goal of maintaining an atmosphere of peace and respect. Respect for all involved was paramount and, given the nature of the case, respect for Aboriginal peoples not only participating in the proceedings, but also following the proceedings in person and on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network. Fostering this atmosphere of peace and respect is of paramount importance considering the Tribunal\u2019s key role in determining fundamental human rights and in safeguarding the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice, especially for Aboriginal peoples.\n[40] In dealing with the remaining remedial issues in this case, we should continue to aim for peace and respect. More importantly, I urge everyone involved to ponder the true meaning of reconciliation and how we can achieve it. I strongly believe that we have an opportunity, all of us together, to set a positive example for the children across Canada, and even across the world, that we are able to do our part in achieving reconciliation in Canada. My hope and goal is that, for generations to come, people will look at what was done in this case as a turning point that led to meaningful change for First Nations children and families in this country. We, the Panel and parties, are in a privileged position to continue to contribute to this change in a substantial way.\n[41] On this journey towards change, I hope trust can be rebuilt between the parties. Effective and transparent communication will be of the utmost importance in this regard. Words need to be supported by actions and actions will not be understood if they are not communicated. Reconciliation cannot be achieved without communication and collaboration amongst the parties. While the circumstances that led to the findings in the Decision are very disconcerting, the opportunity to address those findings through positive change is now present. This is the season for change. The time is now.\n[42] Finally, in keeping with the spirit of reconciliation and expediency in this matter, the Panel had hoped the parties would have met a few times by now and discussed remedies. Each party has information and\/or expertise that would assist those discussions and be of benefit in resolving this matter more expeditiously. While the Panel was required to issue this ruling, it continues to encourage the parties to meet and discuss the resolution of this matter. As always, the Panel is available to assist and remains committed to overseeing the implementation of its orders in the short and the long term.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P.

Motion for interested party status 1\nII. Interest in proceedings and assistance to be provided 2\nIII. Extent of participation 4\nIV. Ruling 6\nI. Motion for interested party status\n[1] The Nishnawbe Aski Nation (the NAN), specifically the NAN Chiefs Committee, seeks leave to intervene in these proceedings, at the remedies stage, as an interested party. The NAN is a political territorial organization that represents the socioeconomic and political interests of 49 First Nation communities located in Northern Ontario.\n[2] Granting interested party status falls within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion pursuant to section 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA) and Rules 3 and 8(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). As such, and subject to the rules of natural justice, the Tribunal is the master of its own procedure (see Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 1 SCR 560 at pp. 568-569; and First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2013 CHRT 16 at para. 50).\n[3] An application for interested party status is determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of the specific circumstances of the proceedings and the issues being considered. A person or organization may be granted interested party status if they are impacted by the proceedings and can provide assistance to the Tribunal in determining the issues before it. That assistance should add a different perspective to the positions taken by the other parties and further the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the matter. Furthermore, pursuant to section 48.9(1) of the CHRA, the extent of an interested party\u2019s participation must take into account the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to conduct proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (see Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada, 2000 CanLII 28883 (CHRT) at paras. 22-23; Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2001 CanLII 25862 (CHRT) at para. 6; Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 17 at paras. 6-8; and Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Treasury Board of Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada), 2011 CHRT 19 at paras. 22-23).\n[4] None of the parties in this matter oppose the NAN\u2019s motion. However, as master of its own procedure and pursuant to the requirements of the CHRA, the Panel must be satisfied that the NAN can bring a meaningful contribution to these proceedings and can assist the Tribunal in determining the issues before it; and, if so, what the extent of NAN\u2019s participation should be.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, the NAN\u2019s motion seeking interested party status is granted. The extent of its participation shall be limited to written submissions with respect to the specific considerations of delivering child and family services to remote and Northern Ontario communities and the factors required to successfully provide those services in those communities.\nII. Interest in proceedings and assistance to be provided\n[6] The NAN seeks to file written materials on the order resulting from this Panel\u2019s decision in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 2 (the Decision). In the Decision, the Panel determined First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are denied equal child and family services, and\/or differentiated adversely in the provision of child and family services, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). The Panel ordered Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the First Nations Child and Family Services (FNCFS) Program and the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians applicable in Ontario (the 1965 Agreement) to reflect the findings in the Decision. INAC was also ordered to cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of the principle.\n[7] Given the complexity and far-reaching effects of these orders, the Panel requested further clarification from the parties on how these orders could best be implemented on a practical, meaningful and effective basis, both in the short and long term. It also requested further clarification with respect to the Complainants\u2019 requests for compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA. The Panel retained jurisdiction to deal with these outstanding issues following further clarification from the parties.\n[8] The NAN seeks to assist in this remedial clarification process. It submits that the Tribunal\u2019s remedies will have a direct impact on child and family services within its territory. That is, NAN communities are typically remote and isolated, without year-round road access, and dispersed amongst a swath of land covering two-thirds of Ontario. It claims to have unique subject-matter expertise with respect to the specific considerations of delivering child and family services to remote and northern communities and the factors required to successfully provide those services in those communities. In this regard, it is also engaged with the Government of Ontario on the development of an Aboriginal child and youth strategy. The NAN submits these discussions are addressing the same issues as those in the Decision, including Jordan\u2019s Principle, Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act, and funding for prevention programs. The NAN seeks to bring its experience and knowledge before the Tribunal to ensure that any ordered remedies are designed and implemented pursuant to the particular context of remote and northern communities.\n[9] Indeed, many of the Panel\u2019s findings with respect of the 1965 Agreement were related to the circumstances and challenges faced by remote communities in Ontario. The Panel identified various factors which impact the performance and quality of the child and family services delivered to those communities and which can result in more children being sent outside the community to receive those services. Those factors include the added time and expense for Children\u2019s Aid Societies to travel to remote communities; the challenges remote communities face in terms of recruiting and retaining staff while dealing with larger case volumes; the lack of suitable housing, which makes it difficult to find foster homes in remote communities; the lack of surrounding health and social programs and services available to remote communities and their limited access to court services; and the lack of infrastructure and capacity building for remote communities to address all these issues (see the Decision at paras. 231-235, 245 and 392).\n[10] The NAN\u2019s direct affiliation with remote communities experiencing these issues will ensure their interests inform any remedy issued by the Panel and will assist in crafting an effective and meaningful response to these issues. In the same vein, the NAN\u2019s involvement in developing an Aboriginal child and youth strategy with the Government of Ontario may assist the Panel in crafting effective and meaningful orders to address other findings it made regarding the 1965 Agreement; specifically, that the agreement has not been updated for quite some time and does not account for changes made over the years to the Child and Family Services Act for such things as band representatives and other mental health and prevention services. The Panel found this last issue was compounded by a lack of coordination amongst federal programs in dealing with health and social services that affect children and families in need, despite those types of programs being synchronized under Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act (see the Decision at paras. 228-230, 235, 392 and 458).\n[11] Given these findings in the Decision and the Panel\u2019s order to reform the 1965 Agreement to reflect those findings, it is clear that the NAN has an interest in these proceedings and, more importantly, that it can potentially provide a meaningful contribution and assistance in determining the remaining remedial issues in this case.\nIII. Extent of participation\n[12] Despite the NAN\u2019s interest and potential contribution, the Panel must ensure that its proposed intervention will not unduly affect the informality and expeditiousness of these proceedings or cause prejudice to the parties or the Tribunal. In this regard, the NAN proposes to file written submissions on remedies, addressing its unique perspective as an advocate for Ontario\u2019s northern and remote communities, without duplicating submissions already made.\n[13] With already four parties and two interested parties to this litigation, the management of this case and hearing to date has presented numerous challenges in terms of satisfying the rights of the parties, but also in terms of effectively administering the Tribunal\u2019s limited time and resources. Adding another party to all this, especially at this late stage, is not only rare, but also adds to the challenge of effectively managing this case. That said, the Panel finds the benefit of the NAN\u2019s proposed intervention outweighs the impact it may have on the conduct of these proceedings.\n[14] However, given we are at the remedial stage of these proceedings, the NAN\u2019s written submissions should only address the outstanding remedies and not re-open matters already determined. The hearing of the merits of the complaint is completed and any further evidence on those issues is now closed. The Panel\u2019s role at this stage of the proceedings is to craft an order that addresses the particular circumstances of the case and the findings already made in the Decision. The Tribunal\u2019s remedial clarification and implementation process is not to be confused with a commission of inquiry or a forum for consultation with any and all interested parties. If that were the case, every First Nation community or organization could seek to intervene in these proceedings to share their unique knowledge, experience, culture and history. Processing those applications, let alone admitting further parties into these proceedings, would significantly hinder the Panel\u2019s ability to finalize its order.\n[15] Furthermore, in not duplicating the submissions made by other parties, the NAN should limit its written submissions to the areas where it says it can provide a different perspective to the positions taken by the other parties. That is, the specific considerations of delivering child and family services to remote and northern communities in Ontario and the factors required to successfully provide those services in those communities. Pursuant to the NAN\u2019s unique perspective, the Panel expects its submissions to focus mainly on the application and reform of the 1965 Agreement. Indeed, in a recent ruling in this matter (2016 CHRT 10), the Panel made orders on immediate relief in accordance with its findings in the Decision, but determined it would be more appropriate to address any immediate relief items with respect to the 1965 Agreement following the determination of the NAN\u2019s motion (see paras. 28-29).\n[16] Limiting the NAN\u2019s submissions in this manner recognizes the contribution it can make to these proceedings, while at the same time acknowledging the organizations already representing the main interests at stake in this matter. The Assembly of First Nations and the Chiefs of Ontario represent the various First Nations communities across Canada and Ontario. The interests of First Nations children, youth and families, along with the agencies that serve them, are represented by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada. Furthermore, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) represents the public interest and has led the majority of the evidence in this matter, including the evidence relied upon by the Panel to make the findings in the Decision identified above about remote Ontario communities.\n[17] With the assistance of these parties and interested parties, along with the NAN and INAC, the Panel believes it will have more than enough submissions to craft a meaningful and effective order in response to the Decision.\nIV. Ruling\n[18] The NAN shall be added as an interested party to these proceedings. It can file written submissions on remedies pursuant to the parameters outlined above.\n[19] Within ten business days of this ruling, the NAN shall provide its written submissions on immediate relief items. INAC, the Caring Society, the AFN, the Chiefs of Ontario and the Commission will then have ten business days to respond to those submissions. Any reply thereto by the NAN can be filed within seven business days of INAC\u2019s response and the other parties\u2019 responses, if any.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P.

Order 15\n[1] This is a decision regarding two consolidated complaints, the first dated July 28, 2011 against the individual respondent, Mr. Gagan Gill and the second dated June 16, 2012 against the corporate respondent Gillco Inc. The complaints were filed by Ms. Shelby Anne Opheim (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCHRC\u201d) (hereinafter collectively the \u201cComplaint\u201d). The Complaint alleges the Respondents, Mr. Gagan Gill and Gillco Inc. (collectively the \u201cRespondents\u201d) discriminated against the Complainant on the grounds of sex and age while she was in their employ. The Complainant alleges she was subjected to a series of harassing behaviours from Mr. Gill as a result of her sex and age, including the following unwelcome sexual conduct: a sexualized and demeaning work request, sexual comments, sexual requests and sexual touching. All the allegations arise from the Complainant\u2019s period of employment between May and June of 2011.\n[2] On April 29, 2014, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the CHRC requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into the Complaint.\n[3] The Complainant filed a Statement of Particulars setting out the details of her Complaint. The Respondents, although given the opportunity to do so, provided no response to the Complaint nor any disclosure. The Complainant appeared on her own behalf at the hearing and gave evidence. Mr. Gill represented the Respondents at the hearing and gave evidence. Both the Complainant and Mr. Gill were able to provide helpful evidence at the hearing. No other witnesses were called. The CHRC did not attend the hearing and made no submissions.\nI. Decision\n[4] For the reasons set out below I have determined that the portion of the Complaint alleging sexual harassment as a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 14 of the CHRA has been substantiated. Further, for the reasons set out below, I have determined that the portion of the Complaint alleging discrimination based on sex in accordance with s. 7 of the CHRA has been substantiated. Finally, for the reasons set out below, I have determined that the portion of the Complaint alleging discrimination based on age in accordance with s. 7 of the CHRA has not been substantiated and is dismissed.\nII. Facts\n[5] There were considerable challenges with regard to determining the facts in this matter. Credibility was a significant factor as the Complainant and the Respondents disagreed as to the occurrence of many of the events at issue. Also, as the Respondents failed to participate in the pre-hearing disclosure process, many of the records that may have assisted in determining the facts were not available. The Respondents made mention during the hearing of records which tended to support their position on the facts but failed to provide any such records for consideration. Based on all the testimonial evidence heard, on a weighing of the credibility of the two witnesses on various points as well as on a consideration of the documentary evidence presented by the Complainant, I have made factual findings that follow.\n[6] On May 2, 2011, the Complainant was hired to work as a salesperson and a manager at the Mobilicity retail store owned and operated by the Respondents and located on 17th Ave. SE in Calgary, AB (the \u201cMobilicity store\u201d). The Complainant began working there in that capacity on May 4, 2011. She was 18 years old at the time. In the time in which the Complainant was employed at the Mobilicity store, the individual respondent, Mr. Gill worked on the premises for 2 or 3 days each week. During much of the time that Mr. Gill was in the Mobilicity store premises, Ms. Opheim worked alone with him. However, in addition to Mr. Gill, Mr. Gill\u2019s wife, Jasmin Gill also worked in the Mobilicity store on occasions when both the Complainant and Mr. Gill were present.\n[7] During the first two weeks of her employment, Mr. Gill began to make sexually explicit comments to the Complainant, including: \u201chow\u2019s my sexy worker,\u201d \u201cgood morning sexy\u201d and \u201cyou look hot today.\u201d These comments increased in frequency over those two weeks. The Complainant attempted to ignore the comments. However, the comments continued and their sexual nature intensified.\n[8] Specifically, Mr. Gill and the Complainant were at the Mobilicity store on June 8, 2011 opening the store. The Complainant had recently been advised that the Mobilicity store would be hiring more staff, and she would therefore be expanding the managerial component of her job by supervising these employees. As a result, the Complainant asked Mr. Gill if she could have a raise. Mr. Gill responded: \u201cas long as you give me a blow job.\u201d He then unzipped his pants and laughed. The Complainant declined and left the room.\n[9] In addition to this unwanted sexual request on June 8, 2011, the sexual comments to Ms. Opheim by Mr. Gill increased and by early June 2011 began to include unwanted sexual touching, all while the Complainant was engaged in her employment for the Respondents. By this early June 2011 timeframe, Mr. Gill was grabbing at the Complainant\u2019s buttocks, slapping her buttocks, and attempting to grab her by the hips and pull her into his lap. She asked him to stop on each occasion and he laughed at her. This unwanted sexual touching continued and accelerated in severity, as Mr. Gill began forcing his hands up the Complainant\u2019s skirt and grabbing at her breasts.\n[10] On June 25, 2011, the Complainant arrived at the Mobilicity store for work. The Mobilicity store was having a promotional sale that day. When she arrived, she was \u201cdressed up\u201d in anticipation of the promotional sale. This included wearing a skirt and high-heeled shoes. Instead of working in the store as she had anticipated, the Complainant was asked by Mr. Gill to walk up and down the street in front of the Mobilicity store with flyers advertising the sale. He advised that she would only receive commissions that day from customers responding to the flyers. This was despite the fact that she had told several Mobilicity customers she had previously dealt with to attend on that date to make purchases at the sale.\n[11] The Complainant thought the decision to make her walk up and down the street was intended to make her look \u201ccheap\u201d and it made her uncomfortable, particularly given the fact that the street in question was fairly \u201crough\u201d in her estimation, and given how she was dressed. She expressed her discomfort to Mr. Gill.\n[12] There is some disagreement between the Respondents and the Complainant as to what happened at the end of the day on June 25, 2011, but it is undisputed that at some point during the day, Ms. Opheim went to her residence which was close to the Mobilicity store to change to more appropriate footwear, and that Mr. Gill took issue with this. Ms. Opheim gave evidence that she felt compelled to go home to change her footwear, as she could not walk up and down the street in her high-heeled shoes. Mr. Gill\u2019s evidence was that she had not been following his instructions about her work. At the end of the Complainant\u2019s work shift on June 25, 2011, it is clear the Complainant and Mr. Gill had a discussion in the Mobilicity store about her work that day, and her decision to leave to change her shoes.\n[13] During this discussion, the Complainant had with her a datebook in which she recorded her hours worked. Mr. Gill requested that the Complainant leave her datebook with him so he could record her hours. She refused, stating that it was her personal property. The Complainant gave evidence that she quit her employment with the Respondents because, during this discussion on June 25, 2011, Mr. Gill threatened to fire her if she did not leave her datebook behind. The Respondents assert that Mr. Gill fired the Complainant during this meeting because of the issue regarding her change in footwear and her refusal to turn over the datebook.\n[14] It is agreed by the parties that by the end of the meeting, the Complainant was no longer in the Respondents\u2019 employ. As it is not determinative of any issue whether the Complainant quit or was fired during that meeting with Mr. Gill, no determination has been made in this regard.\n[15] Ms. Opheim testified that on her way out on June 25, 2011, she spoke to Mr. Gill\u2019s wife, Jasmin Gill, who was in the Mobilicity store at that time. The Complainant told her about the sexual comments, sexual requests and sexual touching to which she had been subjected by Mr. Gill. The Complainant then left the Mobilicity store. The Respondents did not call Jasmin Gill to give evidence in this matter or provide any explanation for her absence.\n[16] At the time the Complainant was hired by the Respondents, it was agreed that she would be paid $10 per hour worked, up to 44 hours per week, that she would be paid time and half for hours worked each week beyond 44 hours, and that she would receive 10% commission on all sales she executed. These facts were undisputed.\n[17] Each day when she arrived at the Mobilicity store, Ms. Opheim would prepare the store for opening and would also sign in to her computer, thereby signing in for the purposes of the business\u2019 payroll system. That system, run through R24 Software, is both the system by which hours owing were calculated based on the Complainant\u2019s logging in and out of her computer, and also the means for recording any commissions owing. The system creates a \u201cPayroll Deductions Online Calculator Results\u201d for the employee. In addition to the R24 system that the Respondents relied upon, the Complainant was also recording all her shifts as well as her regular and banked hours in a datebook that she disclosed in this matter. It is this datebook that was the subject of her dispute with Mr. Gill on June 25, 2011.\n[18] In calculating her damages for lost wages, the Complainant relied on several records that she had produced, including; her datebook, the R24 record, copies of cheques she had received from the corporate Respondent, her bank statements, and 2 separate calculations of damages that she prepared for the hearing. The Complainant claimed to have worked 38.5 hours for which she was not paid. She described these hours as \u201cbanked hours.\u201d However, the Complainant gave no evidence as to what banked hours were, how they were earned, how they were intended (by either the Complainant or the Respondents) to be used, and the manner of compensation. The Complainant did give evidence that some of the banked hours were used in some way. But she gave no evidence to explain why she was claiming banked hours beyond the total hours worked that were identified in the R24 records.\n[19] The documentary evidence, when considered as a whole, is insufficient to show amounts owing for any banked hours. The shifts that the Complainant recorded in her datebook for the entire period she was employed by the Respondents are consistent with the entries in the R24 record for which she was paid. The Complainant submitted documents prepared for this hearing in which she included calculations of amounts owing to her as banked hours. These calculations cannot be reconciled with the evidence found in the datebook and the R24 records. The Complainant did not provide additional evidence substantiating the claim for banked hours. I therefore conclude that the Complainant was paid in full for all regular hours worked and commissions earned during her employ with the Respondents, and that there is insufficient evidence to conclude any further amounts are owing to her as banked hours.\n[20] The Complainant\u2019s evidence, undisputed by the Respondents, was that following the end of her employment with the Respondents, she did not receive a Record of Employment and therefore could not apply for Employment Insurance, but was instead forced to borrow money from her family. The Complainant gave no evidence about the amounts she was compelled to borrow. The Complainant also gave evidence that she became depressed and anxious as a result of her experience with the Respondents, and went on anti-depressants in August 2011. Prior to commencing using anti-depressants in August 2011, the Complainant testified that she had not been able to return to work.\n[21] In August 2011 the Complainant began to work for her family\u2019s company, earning $15 per hour but only working 10 hours per week. By November 2011, that position at $15 per hour had become full-time. The Complainant led no evidence as to why she was working less than full-time hours between August and November 2011, including no evidence regarding the potential impact of any medical condition. Although the Complainant provided financial records in connection with her period of employment with the Respondents, she provided no evidence - whether in the form of income tax returns or bank or other financial records - in support of her alleged loss of income between August and November 2011. Further, the Complainant led no evidence with regard to her efforts to find full-time employment between August and November, 2011.\nIII. Law\n[22] According to s. 3 of the CHRA, sex and age are prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n[23] Section 14 of the CHRA sets out the discriminatory practice connected with harassment of an employee. This section reads as follows:\n14. (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n[\u2026]\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[24] In order to make out a prima facie case under s. 14 of the CHRA, the Complainant must establish that the individual Respondent sexually harassed the Complainant in matters related to her employment. The Supreme Court of Canada, in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252, at 1284, described sexual harassment as follows:\nWithout seeking to provide an exhaustive definition of the term, I am of the view that sexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment. [\u2026] Sexual harassment is a demeaning practice, one that constitutes a profound affront to the dignity of the employees forced to endure it. By requiring an employee to contend with unwelcome sexual actions or explicit sexual demands, sexual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim both as an employee and as a human being.\n[25] The Federal Court expanded on the reasoning in Janzen, supra, in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, 1999 CanLII 18902 (FC), [1999] 3 FCR 653. It held that for a sexual harassment allegation to be substantiated, the following must be shown:\n(1) The acts that form the basis of the complaint must be unwelcome, or ought to have been known by a reasonable person to be unwelcome;\n(2) The conduct must be sexual in nature;\n(3) Ordinarily, sexual harassment requires a degree of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to be detrimental to the work environment; and\n(4) Where the sexual harassment takes place in an employment context and the employer has a personnel department and an effective sexual harassment policy, the victim of the harassment must notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct.\n[26] Section 7(b) of the CHRA sets out another discriminatory practice connected with employment. This section reads as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n[\u2026]\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[27] In order to make out a prima facie case under section 7(b) of the CHRA, a complainant must establish that:\n(i) the respondent adversely differentiated in relation to the employee; and\n(ii) there is a connection between\u2014on the one hand\u2014the adverse differential treatment of that individual\u2014and on the other\u2014a prohibited ground of discrimination enumerated in s. 3 of the CHRA (See Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39 (CanLII), at para. 52).\n[28] In this last regard, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be a factor in the employer\u2019s actions or decisions (Ibid; Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.)).\n[29] A prima facie case of discrimination is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558). Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he is entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the employer (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208; Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18).\n[30] The Supreme Court of Canada recently addressed the applicable degree of proof for the establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination in Bombardier, supra, in the context of Quebec\u2019s Charter of human rights and freedoms. The Court confirmed that the Complainant must satisfy the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities, and that the reference to a prima facie case did not indicate a lesser evidentiary burden:\n\u201c[65] Thus, the use of the expression \u201cprima facie discrimination\u201d must not be regarded as a relaxation of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to satisfy the tribunal in accordance with the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities, which he or she must still meet. This conclusion is in fact supported by the passage from O\u2019Malley quoted above, in which the Court stated that the case must be \u201ccomplete and sufficient\u201d, that is, it must correspond to the degree of proof required in the civil law. Absent an exception provided by law, there is in Quebec law only one degree of proof in civil matters, namely proof on a balance of probabilities: art. 2804 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec; see also Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Mastracchio, 1961 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1962] S.C.R. 53, at p. 57; Rousseau v. Bennett, 1955 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1956] S.C.R. 89, at pp. 92-93; Parent v. Lapointe, 1952 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1952] 1 S.C.R. 376, at p. 380\u2026.\u201d\nIV.

Analysis\nA. Prima facie Case of Sexual Harassment\n[31] The Complainant gave clear and specific evidence consistent with the allegations in her Complaint of sexual conduct to which she was exposed, both verbal and physical. This sexual conduct consisted of the following uninvited and unwelcome behaviour: sexual comments, sexual touching, sexual requests and the sexualized and demeaning work request that the Complainant walk up and down the street in front of the Mobilicity store. The conduct was both frequent and ongoing, throughout the period of the Complainant\u2019s employment with the Respondents. As well, on several occasions where the sexual conduct constituted an assault (including grabbing of the Complainant\u2019s breasts and buttocks and forcing a hand up the Complainant\u2019s skirt) it was severe enough to constitute sexual harassment based on a sole occurrence. In this case, notification of the employer was not necessary as there is no evidence the Mobilicity business had either a personnel department or a sexual harassment policy. Nevertheless, I find that notification was clearly given as Mr. Gill was both the responsible employer and the harasser. He was clearly aware of the conduct that was taking place, and of the objections to that conduct expressed by the Complainant.\n[32] The Respondents provided little substantive evidence to rebut the Complainant\u2019s testimony. The only evidence Mr. Gill gave in his examination-in-chief on this point was to state that there was \u201cnothing sexual\u201d with the Complainant and that he \u201cnever touched her.\u201d The Respondents did not challenge the Complainant\u2019s evidence in their cross examination of her. The Respondents did not address in their evidence any of the specific allegations of sexual comments or sexual requests, and Mr. Gill did not make specific reference in chief or in cross to the events the Complainant set out.\n[33] Further, while the only other witness to these matters was the individual Respondent\u2019s wife, Jasmin Gill, the Respondents did not call her to give evidence. In particular, the Respondents did not call Jasmin Gill to dispute the Complainant\u2019s evidence that on June 25, 2011, the Complainant disclosed to Jasmin Gill all of the allegations of sexual conduct that form the basis of this Complaint.\n[34] Finally, the Respondents provided no documentary evidence that would tend to refute the Complainant\u2019s allegations. At the hearing, the Respondents indicated that they had access to video-taped security footage from the Mobilicity store that would exonerate Mr. Gill, but they did not disclose this footage prior to the hearing and did not present it at the hearing.\n[35] I find that the Complainant\u2019s evidence at the hearing was detailed as to the events in question and those details were consistent with details provided in her original Complaint and in her Statement of Particulars. I find that the Complainant\u2019s evidence was given in a forthright and straightforward manner, and that the Respondents raised only the most limited opposition to that evidence. Further, I have concerns about the Respondents\u2019 failure to call Jasmin Gill, the only other alleged witness in the matter, and their failure to produce at the hearing the videotapes that they indicated would exonerate them in relation to the allegations. Given all of this, with regard to all the allegations of sexual harassment, including uninvited and unwelcome behavior consisting of sexual comments, sexual contact, sexual requests and the sexualized and demeaning work request, I prefer the evidence of the Complainant and find the individual Respondent committed a discriminatory practice in sexually harassing the Complainant. I further find that in accordance with s. 65 of the CHRA, the sexual harassment of the Complainant by the individual Respondent is deemed to be the act of the corporate Respondent.\nB. Prima Facie Case of Discrimination Based on Sex\n[36] The Federal Court of Appeal has indicated that in addition to any claims made in accordance with s. 14 of the CHRA, sexual harassment may constitute adverse differentiation based on sex under s. 7(b) of the CHRA: Robichaud v. Brennan [1984] 2 F.C. 799, rev\u2019d on other grounds, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84. Following Robichaud, the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that sexual harassment constitutes discrimination based on sex (Janzen v. Platy, supra).\n[37] For the reasons set out in the findings above with regard to s. 14, I find the Respondents\u2019 treatment of the Complainant also constitutes prima facie adverse differentiation in the course of her employment based on the prohibited ground of sex, in accordance with s. 7(b) of the CHRA.\nC. Prima facie Case of Discrimination based on Age\n[38] The Complaint also sets out that the discrimination as particularized above constitutes discrimination based on the characteristic of age. In her evidence, the Complainant has confirmed that she was only 18 years old at the time the harassment was taking place. However, other than stating her age at the time, the Complainant led no other evidence to suggest a connection between her age and any conduct of the Respondents. A statement of her age, on its own, does not constitute a prima facie case of discrimination in accordance with the standard of proof set out in Bombardier, supra. The Complainant\u2019s allegation of discrimination based on the prohibited ground of age is dismissed.\nD. Remedy\n[39] Given the finding that the Complainant suffered the discriminatory practices of sexual harassment under s. 14, and adverse differentiation in the course of her employment based on sex under s. 7(b), the Complainant may be entitled to compensation. The Complainant claims a number of remedies. The first claim is for amounts owing to her as unpaid income during her period of employment with the Respondents. These amounts are not eligible for compensation as, on the facts, it appears that all amounts owing to the Complainant were paid to her by the time she left the Respondents\u2019 employ. Insufficient evidence was led to support any further claims for unpaid income during her employment.\n[40] With regard to the Complainant\u2019s claims for amounts owing for loss of income in the period between June 25 and November 1, 2011, the Complainant has sought no particular amount. The Complainant also led no evidence as to her efforts to mitigate her losses by seeking full-time employment between August 2011, when she began working part-time, and November 1, 2011 when she obtained full-time work. The Complainant did give evidence, which I accept, that she had found the experience with Mr. Gill very difficult, and had been unable to return to work until she began taking anti-depressants in August 2011. However, the Complainant did not provide any evidence about why she was only working 10 hours per week between August and November 1, 2011. Specifically, she did not provide evidence that she was either unable to work full-time as a result of a medical condition (which will be discussed below), or that she was seeking full-time work but was unable to find any.\n[41] In view of the above evidence, and the evidence presented indicating her previous earnings, the Complainant\u2019s compensation for lost wages, in accordance with s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, shall therefore be restricted to a one-month period immediately following the end of her employ with the Respondents. The Complainant is therefore entitled to compensation from the Respondents for this one month period in the amount of $1,788.00.\n[42] The Complainant gave evidence that she was depressed and anxious following the discrimination by the Respondents, and will be required to take anti-depressants for the rest of her life, at a cost of approximately $135 per month. She gave no evidence, however, that this medical condition in any way impaired her ability to work on a full-time basis after August 2011. Further, the Complainant gave no evidence as to the onset of this condition, the symptoms she experienced, whether and when she obtained a diagnosis in relation to the condition, and what its manifestation has been since the time of her employment with the Respondents. Further, the Complainant disclosed no medical documentation substantiating the diagnosis or the costs associated with the treatment for which she is claiming. A lack of medical documentation is not in and of itself fatal to a claim: see Canada (A.G.) v. Hicks, 2015 FC 599, para. 80. However, the scarcity of evidence supporting this allegation as a whole - including medical records substantiating the diagnosis and financial records substantiating treatment costs - is significant. I accept the Complainant\u2019s evidence that she experienced depression and anxiety as a result of this situation. However, the Complainant has provided insufficient evidence to support her claim of a permanent lifelong condition, and of the treatment costs associated with that condition. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence that the costs were and will continue to be incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. Nor, as I have indicated earlier, was there sufficient evidence that the loss of income after August 2011 was a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[43] I find that the Complainant is entitled to compensation from the Respondents under s. 53(2)(e) in the amount of $7,500.00 for pain and suffering. In ordering compensation in this amount I have considered first that, while the Complainant was unable to make out a case for the cost of her treatment for depression and anxiety, she clearly suffered from this condition as a result of the Respondents\u2019 conduct, and this contributes to the scope of compensation she is to be awarded under s. 53(2)(e). See on this point Hunt v. Transport One 2008 CHRT 23, paras 45-47. In addition, while the Complainant was unable to make out a case of discrimination based on her age, her very young age and resulting vulnerability at the time of the events are relevant factors in awarding compensation for psychological damage in a case of sexual harassment. See Bouvier v. Metro Express, 1992 CanLII 1429 (CHRT), aff\u2019d Canada (C.H.R.C.) v. Canada (H.R.T.) (1993) 72 F.T.R.\n[44] The Complainant is further entitled to compensation from the Respondents under s. 53(3) of the CHRA in the amount of $12,000.00. Such damages are granted on the basis that the Respondents\u2019 actions, in repeatedly sexually harassing the Complainant and in discriminating against her based on her sex, constituted a willful and reckless discriminatory practice. In arriving at this decision, I have considered that the Respondents are not a large or sophisticated employer, and that the harassment took place over a relatively short period of time. On the other hand, I have also considered that the harassment was severe, and that it continued despite requests from the Complainant that it stop. See Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 21, para. 145.\n[45] Given my finding in accordance with s. 65 of the CHRA that the corporate Respondent is in this case responsible for the actions of the individual Respondent, both Respondents are jointly and severally liable for any and all forms of compensation awarded to the Complainant as per the above. On this point see Bushey, supra, para. 16; Bouvier, supra.\nVI. Order\n[46] Having found that the Complainant\u2019s allegations against the Respondents have been substantiated in part, in accordance with ss. 7(b) and 14 of the CHRA , the Tribunal orders pursuant to s. 53 that:\n1. The Respondents shall pay to the Complainant $1,788.00 as compensation for lost wages;\n2. The Respondents shall pay to the Complainant $7,500.00 as compensation for pain and suffering; and\n3. The Respondents shall pay to the Complainant $12,000.00 as compensation for willful and reckless conduct.\nSigned by\nRicki T.

Complaint\n[1] Christina Green is the Complainant in this case. She alleges that Trevor Thomas, the Respondent, sexually harassed her during a work-related trip in his truck in 2008. Mr. Thomas denies the allegations.\n[2] The complaint is filed under section 14(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. [1] Section 14 says it is a discriminatory practice in matters related to employment to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 14(2) deems sexual harassment to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[3] Both parties represented themselves at the hearing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate at the hearing. Both parties testified and each was their only witness called.\nII. Elements of Harassment and Sexual Harassment\n[4] Ms. Green must present sufficient evidence, on a balance of probabilities, to substantiate her complaint of harassment. Harassment is any words or conduct that is unwelcome or ought to be known to be unwelcome. It usually denotes repetitious or persistent acts, although a single serious event can be sufficient to constitute harassment. It is determined on a case-by-case basis applying the standard of the reasonable person in the circumstances (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), 1999 CanLII 18902 (FC) [Franke]).\n[5] To constitute sexual harassment, the harassment must be sexual in nature and includes: requests for sexual favours and propositioning; pinching, grabbing, hugging, kissing and leering; and, gender-based insults or remarks regarding a person\u2019s appearance or sexual habits.\n[6] The Supreme Court of Canada defined sexual harassment in the workplace in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd: [2] :\nsexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment. [\u2026] [S]exual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim both as an employee and as a human being.\n[7] The Federal Court of Canada-Trial Division elaborated on this definition in Canada (HRC). Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke. [3] In order for a complaint of harassment to be substantiated, the Court stated that the following must be demonstrated:\n(i)The impugned conduct must be of a sexual nature. Requests for sexual favours and propositioning are sexual in nature and constitute a psychological form of sexual harassment. Acts of harassment may also be physical, such as pinching, grabbing, hugging, kissing and leering. The acts could be verbal in nature, as well, encompassing conduct such as gender-based insults or remarks regarding a person\u2019s appearance or sexual habits. The Tribunal\u2019s determination of what is \u201csexual in nature\u201d is carried out in accordance with the standard of the reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms.\n(ii) The acts that are the subject of the complaint were unwelcome. In other words, it must be determined whether the alleged harasser\u2019s conduct was desired or solicited. This task can be accomplished by assessing the complainant\u2019s reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment, and determining whether she expressly, or by her behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. The Court recognized, however, that a verbal \u201cno\u201d is not required in all cases and that a repetitive failure to respond to a harasser\u2019s comments could constitute a signal to him that his conduct is unwelcome. In these cases, the appropriate standard to apply will again be that of a reasonable person in the circumstances.\n(iii) Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident, such as a physical assault, may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. The objective reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well.\n[8] Together, Janzen and Franke define the elements that Ms. Green\u2019s evidence must establish in order for me to find that she was sexually harassed by Mr. Thomas during that work-related trip in his truck in April 2008.\nIII. Ms. Green\u2019s testimony\n[9] Ms. Green was a truck driver in Alberta. She was contracted by KEE Management Solutions Inc., which hired truck drivers, to drive for Quik-X Transportation. Mr. Thomas was also a contractor for KEE but drove for TransX Limited.\n[10] No issues were raised with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the complaint, including that the complaint involved matters related to employment; nor was the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal challenged.\n[11] According to her testimony, on April 1, 2008, Ms. Green went to the KEE office in Calgary to pick-up an airline ticket to fly to Langley, British Columbia where she was to retrieve a waiting truck and drive its load back to Calgary. Ms. Green was told by the KEE office manager that Quik-X did not leave an airline ticket for her contrary to what she had been told.\n[12] Mr. Thomas was in the KEE office at the same time. Overhearing the conversation, he offered to take Ms. Green to Langley in his truck as he was headed there shortly. Ms. Green said that she accepted the offer reluctantly as she had no other way to get to Langley. They left in Mr. Thomas\u2019 truck in the afternoon of April 1, 2008.\n[13] Ms. Green says the trip was uneventful at first with the parties chatting about truck driver issues. However, she says before they got to Banff the talk had turned sexual and Mr. Thomas asked her for oral sex. Ms. Green says she refused his advances, swore at him and threatened to report him if he persisted.\n[14] Soon after Ms. Green says she wanted to go to the back of the truck cab to rest. As she headed to the back of the truck, she says Mr. Thomas showed her photos of a brunette woman and a man\u2019s penis. Ms. Green says he identified the people in the photos as his wife and himself. She says Mr. Thomas continued with sexual comments including the size of his penis and Ms. Green\u2019s breasts. She says he also offered to pull the truck over and perform oral sex on her. She refused and went to the back of the truck to rest.\n[15] Ms. Green says that when she attempted to return to the front to sit in the passenger seat, Mr. Thomas grabbed her left buttock with his hand. She says she swatted away his hand. She says he grabbed her buttock a second time and squeezed it. She said she broke away from him and sat down in the passenger seat.\n[16] Mr. Thomas stopped the truck in Golden, British Columbia for a short rest stop. Ms. Green slept in the top bunk and Mr. Thomas slept in the bottom bunk. He told her that he slept in the nude. No other verbal or physical interaction occurred during this stop.\n[17] The trip continued until they stopped to sleep at the Husky truck stop in Sicamous, British Columbia early on April 2. Ms. Green says that when she awoke, she attempted to quietly climb down from the top bunk without waking Mr. Thomas. She says when she was partway down, she became aware that he was standing behind her. He had his hands on her waist and said he would help her down. Ms. Green says she attempted to go back to the top bunk but could not break free from his grip around her waist. Ms. Green says she did not want to be near Mr. Thomas as she believed he was nude.\n[18] She says she jumped down from the top bunk with her back to Mr. Thomas. Mr. Thomas was still holding her by the waist. She says he was rubbing his erect penis on her back and started to lift her off the floor. She yelled and swore at him to let her go. She felt he might rape her, something she had suffered as a teenager. After a struggle, she broke free and ran inside to the bathroom at the Husky station. She was distraught and crying.\n[19] She called her spouse Chris May and told him what had happened. She did not want to cause difficulty for Mr. Thomas despite what had happened. She was also concerned about losing her job as she needed the money. She decided to return to the truck and finish the trip. On Mr. May\u2019s advice, she keyed in 911 on her cellphone and told Mr. Thomas she would call for help if he attempted any further sexual advances. They drove to Langley without further incident.\n[20] Ms. Green testified that she subsequently reported the incident to both KEE and Quik-X. She also stated that she filed a complaint with the police.\n[21] Ms. Green also testified that she took three months off to recover from this incident. When she contacted KEE after three months, she was told she was no longer working for them. She has not worked in the trucking industry since and has had great difficulty in finding employment or maintaining jobs she has obtained.\nIV. Mr. Thomas\u2019 testimony\n[22] Mr. Thomas\u2019 testimony concurred with that of Ms. Green as to the beginning of their trip. He agreed that he offered her a ride to Langley in his truck while they were at the KEE office in Calgary.\n[23] During the trip he admitted that some of his sexual talk to Ms. Green was inappropriate. He admitted telling her that he slept in his truck naked. As to the specific acts of sexual harassment alleged by Ms. Green, he denies they occurred.\n[24] For example, he denied asking her for oral sex or offering to perform oral sex on her. He denies showing her nude photos of his wife and himself. He denies standing behind her in the nude and grabbing her waist when she attempted to climb down from the top bunk in the truck.\n[25] Mr. Thomas says when the trip concluded in Langley, he dropped Ms. Green at her destination and they parted on normal terms.\nV. Complaint substantiated\n[26] I am satisfied based on the evidence presented that sexual harassment took place as alleged by Ms. Green. Her submissions and evidence throughout the human rights complaint process were clear and consistent. During her testimony, she provided details of the alleged harassment in a straightforward manner without embellishment or inconsistencies.\n[27] Mr. Thomas was a reluctant participant in the process. He did not file a Statement of Particulars and provided only the merest of details during his testimony. His two admissions dealing with inappropriate sexual talk and his preference for sleeping in the nude while in his truck are consistent with the Ms. Green\u2019s version of events. Otherwise, he simply denied that the incidents described by Ms. Green occurred.\n[28] When given the opportunity to challenge Ms. Green\u2019s evidence during cross-examination, he did not do so aside from asking why she did not call the police immediately.\n[29] During his testimony, he implied that Ms. Green had an option to travel to Langley with a friend from Quik-X the next day but chose to go with him on April 1. However, even if true, that fact would not change my assessment of the evidence, including Ms. Green\u2019s assertions that she indicated to Mr. Thomas that his actions were unwelcomed.\n[30] I am not convinced by Mr. Thomas\u2019 general denial that most of Ms. Green\u2019s allegations did not occur. Rather, on the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that Mr. Thomas\u2019 words and actions on that work-related trip were of a sexual nature, persistent and not welcomed by Ms. Green. She testified how she was affected emotionally by the sexual harassment, which detrimentally affected Ms. Green\u2019s dignity and self-respect as a human being.\n[31] On the totality of the evidence presented, I find that Mr. Thomas sexually harassed Ms. Green contrary to section 14 of the Act.\nVI. Order\n[32] Ms. Green is seeking $20,000 for pain and suffering caused by Mr. Thomas pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act; and, $20,000 as special compensation, under s. 53(3), because his actions were wilful or reckless.\n[33] Ms. Green has not worked in a similar capacity in the trucking industry since the sexual harassment in 2008. She testified that as a result of the sexual harassment, she required three months off work to recover and was unable to find similar employment when she was ready to resume her career. She has worked in a series of other, lower paying jobs. Her common law marriage ended and she has suffered from various health issues.\n[34] I have considered the circumstances of the case and reviewed the prevailing case law on non-pecuniary damages in Goodwin v. Birkett [4] , and Boushey v. Sharma [5] . As the Supreme Court of Canada said in Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) the aim of the legislation is not to punish the transgressor but, as much as possible, to eliminate such discriminatory behaviour. [6] I have considered the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed. I find that the sexual harassment from Mr. Thomas caused pain and suffering to Ms. Green. The words and actions of Mr. Thomas caused stress, anxiety and emotional upset to Ms. Green during the trip and for a period of time afterwards to the extent that she felt it necessary to take three months off work. Although the harassment occurred only during the trip, its effects were longer lasting on Ms. Green contributing adversely to her mental state. It may have contributed to the ending of her marriage and her later health problems. For her pain and suffering, I award her the sum of $5,000 as compensation.\n[35] As to whether Mr. Thomas\u2019 actions were wilful or reckless, I reviewed the Federal Court\u2019s guidance in the case of Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone [7] ,\n[A] finding of wilfulness requires the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional. Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly.\nI do not find that his actions were intentional but he failed to appreciate or was indifferent to its effects on Ms. Green. It was isolated to the trip and did not reoccur but had adverse consequences for her. I find that his conduct was reckless. For that, I award Ms. Green the sum of $2,500.\n[36] Ms. Green also claimed for wage loss for the income she would have received had the sexual harassment not taken place. I find that had the actions of Mr. Thomas not occurred, Ms. Green would not have taken three months off work in 2008. I award her three months of wage loss. In reviewing her income tax records entered into evidence, I use her tax return of 2007 as the base in quantifying the award. In 2007, her earned income was $22,773 for a monthly average of $1897.75. I calculate her wage loss award for three months at $5,693.25. I find that the wage loss claimed by Ms. Green in subsequent periods to be too remote to have a causal link to the sexual harassment that she suffered in 2008. I note that she was able to find employment in a number of other jobs. I also note that her doctor wrote that she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and lupus in 2010 which could have contributed to her difficulty in finding and holding steady employment.\n[37] Ms. Green has also claimed for a number of other incidental expenses such as expenses for moving and for trying to find work. I also find these expenses too remote to be linked to the harassment that she suffered and make no award for these claims.\n[38] Simple interest shall be payable on the monetary awards, to be calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. The interest will run from April 4, 2008 until the date of payment of the awards of compensation and wage loss.\nSigned by\nAlex G.

H-6 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), that the Respondent employer discriminated against the Complainant based on his age and disability, by terminating his employment in response to his request to work reduced hours. The complaint alleges the Respondent employer engaged in adverse differential treatment, termination of employment and established or pursued a discriminatory policy or practice, contrary to the Act. The complaint was referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on May 28, 2015. The Commission indicated that it would be participating at the hearing of this matter.\nII. Background\n[2] The Complainant was initially represented by (non-lawyer) Ms. Kathy Finstad. The Respondent has been represented by Mr. Aaron Crangle throughout. This matter was scheduled for hearing June 6 to 10 and June 13 and 17, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario. Mr. Daniel Poulin is counsel for the Commission. Mr. Poulin recently advised the Commission has reconsidered its position and decided it will not participate at the hearing.\n[3] On April 28, 2016, Mr. Nikolay Chsherbinin advised the Tribunal and counsel for the Respondent and the Commission that he was retained to represent the Complainant.\n[4] On May 30, 2016, Respondent counsel wrote to the Tribunal and other counsel requesting an adjournment of the scheduled hearing as a result of disclosure he had received from Complainant\u2019s counsel on May 19, 2016. The Complainant opposed the adjournment request and a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) was arranged for June 2, 2016.\n[5] At the CMCC on June 2, 2016, counsel agreed to cancel the first week of the hearing, June 6 to 10, 2016. Another CMCC was scheduled for June 9, 2016 to confirm that the exchange of witness lists, will-say statements, and disclosure was complete so that the hearing scheduled June 13 to 17, 2016 could proceed with the Complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s evidence and to schedule any additional hearing days in August 2016 for the Respondent to present its case.\n[6] On June 7, 2016, in anticipation of the CMCC scheduled for June 9, 2016, the Respondent sent an email to the Tribunal and other counsel noting that the Complainant\u2019s family physician, Dr. Filomena Bautista, was not on the Complainant\u2019s witness list. The Respondent stated: \u201cThe contents of the doctor[\u2019s] reports are very much in dispute and relate to a central issue in the Application. Natural Justice requires that the respondent be given the opportunity to test the reliability and veracity of the applicant\u2019s evidence by cross-examination.\u201d\n[7] The Respondent requested that the Tribunal refuse to enter Dr. Bautista\u2019s medical records and reports into evidence and that it consider dismissing the Complainant\u2019s case based on his failure to call Dr. Bautista as a witness and the exclusion of Dr. Bautista\u2019s medical records and reports, which would result in no reasonable prospect of success.\n[8] On June 9, 2016, I asked Respondent counsel if his concerns would be addressed if the Complainant made Dr. Bautista available for his cross-examination and he stated he would be satisfied with an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Bautista. The Complainant agreed to co-ordinate the date for cross-examination with the Respondent and Dr. Bautista, likely to take place during the hearing dates in August 2016. I was not required to rule on the Respondent\u2019s request.\n[9] On June 9, 2016, Respondent counsel advised he intended to retain Dr. Brett Belchetz, as an expert, to review and critique the medical records, findings, opinions, etc., of Dr. Bautista, the Complainant\u2019s family physician, in a written report, to be filed in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) and to be presented as part of the Respondent\u2019s case in August 2016.\n[10] The Complainant was surprised the Respondent referred to Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence as \u201cexpert evidence\u201d as the Respondent had earlier advised it was not expert evidence. Complainant counsel objected to the proposed expert report and he objected to proceeding with his case on June 13, 2016 without prior receipt and review of the expert report. Commission counsel had no objection to the Complainant\u2019s request for an adjournment to August 2016 and he advised that since the expert report would be provided well in advance of the hearing dates scheduled in late August 2016, the expert report was provided in accordance with Rule 6(3) and he had no objection to it.\n[11] At the CMCC on June 9, 2016, the June 13 to 17, 2016 hearing dates were further adjourned to August 22 to 26 and August 29 to September 2, 2016, to allow the Complainant the opportunity to review the expert report of Dr. Belchetz and decide if he plans to make a motion to exclude the expert\u2019s report and evidence. The Respondent was to provide the expert report by June 24, 2016. Pre-hearing motions, if any, were to be filed by July 8, 2016. The next CMCC was scheduled for July 11, 2016. The Tribunal provided counsel with the recent Supreme Court of Canada (\u201cSCC\u201d) judgment in White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23 (\u201cWhite Burgess\u201d) in relation to a motion, if any, to exclude Dr. Belchetz\u2019s expert evidence.\n[12] The Complainant filed a motion on July 8, 2016 and the Respondent and the Commission requested time to file a response. On July 11, 2016, a brief CMCC was held to confirm the dates for the Respondent and the Commission to respond to the motion and a CMCC was scheduled for July 20, 2016 to discuss and possibly rule on the motion.\n[13] On July 20, 2016, I summarized my understanding of the motion and replies to ensure I understood the parties\u2019 arguments. Counsel confirmed my understanding and elaborated on their submissions. I explained that I required more time to review cases and to make a decision on the motion. I advised I would make my best efforts to issue the decision by August 8, 2016 and counsel were invited to forward any additional cases to my attention by July 29, 2016.\nIII. Motion to exclude the evidence of Dr. Belchetz (\u201cthe Motion\u201d)\n[14] The Motion seeks an order to exclude the letter of Dr. Brett Belchetz dated July 21, 2016 (\u201cthe report\u201d) and his viva voce evidence, whether qualified as an \u201cexpert\u201d or not.\n[15] The grounds for the Motion are as follows:\nThe Respondent previously confirmed in its Amended Statement of Particulars dated November 9, 2015 that the Complainant provided sufficient medical documentation to indicate the Complainant was fit to drive, so this should no longer be an issue;\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s characterization during the CMCC on June 9, 2016 of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence as a critique of Dr. Bautista\u2019s diagnosis, prognosis, assessments and record keeping, Dr. Belchetz\u2019s letter went beyond critique and harshly criticized Dr.Bautista\u2019s diagnosis, prognosis, assessments and record keeping;\nDr. Belchetz\u2019s curriculum vitae did not list any training or experience to train or assess the standard of care of another physician;\nDr. Belchetz criticized Dr. Bautista\u2019s processes but did not comment on the correctness of her diagnosis of the Complainant, nor did Dr. Belchetz offer any assessment of his own regarding the Complainant\u2019s diagnosis or fitness to work, for 40 to 45 hours a week or at all;\nDr. Belchetz is not the Complainant\u2019s treating physician and did not perform any assessment, evaluation or investigations of his own, nor did he talk to Dr. Bautista.His report is based on assumptions, speculation and hearsay; and\nDr. Belchetz was engaged by the Respondent solely to provide opinion evidence forlitigation purposes and is therefore a \u201chired gun\u201d, who tailored his report to suit theneeds of the Respondent and not to assist the Tribunal.\n[16] The Complainant supported his argument based with the following authorities: White Burgess; Meady v. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp., 2015 ONCA 6; Westerhoff; and, Anderson v. Canada.\n[17] The Complainant urged the Tribunal to assess the admissibility of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report and viva voce evidence before the hearing rather than to allow the report and\/or evidence and determine what weight, if any, should be given to them at the conclusion of the hearing. The Complainant referred to White Burgess and Meady, to support his request for a decision on admissibility before the hearing.\n[18] The Complainant referred to the admissibility criteria set out in White Burgess: 1) relevance; 2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; 3) the absence of an exclusionary rule; and, 4) a properly qualified expert.\n[19] Citing Westerhoff, the Complainant draws a distinction between Dr. Bautista, the Complainant\u2019s treating physician, and Dr. Belchetz, who is a \u201clitigation expert.\u201d The Complainant submits Dr. Bautista is a participant expert witness who can offer fact evidence and opinion evidence based on her experience with, and assessment of, the Complainant, as his treating physician. Dr. Belchetz was engaged in June, 2016 solely for the purpose of expressing opinion evidence to assist the Respondent. Dr. Belchetz has had no direct involvement with the Complainant or the Respondent, during the period leading up to termination. The Complainant submits that Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report is clearly assuming the role of advocate for the Respondent.\n[20] The Complainant questions the relevancy and necessity of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence in light of his apparent advocacy for the Respondent and the lack of credentials that would permit him to offer his critical opinion of Dr. Bautista\u2019s standard of care and diagnostic processes. The Complainant requests that the Tribunal exclude Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence, whether as an expert or not, on the basis that his unreliable and unsubstantiated negative criticisms of Dr. Bautista are prejudicial to the Complainant.\nIV. Respondent\u2019s Submissions to the Motion to Exclude Dr. Belchetz\u2019s Evidence\n[21] The Respondent submits that Dr. Bautista\u2019s notes and reports provided to the Respondent did not disclose a \u201cdisability\u201d, but rather refers to stress, fatigue and anxiety. The Respondent explains that in order to defend the complaint, it requested disclosure in 2015 of Dr. Bautista\u2019s medical records that support her notes and reports to the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s counsel acknowledged that he received the disclosure in September 2015 and that he referred to Dr. Bautista\u2019s notes and reports when drafting the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) and Amended Statement of Particulars (\u201cASOP\u201d).\n[22] The Respondent states in its response to the Motion that it:\n\u2026retained Dr. Brett Belchetz to review the clinical notes and records of Dr. Bautista to conduct a peer review. Serious concerns were raised by Dr. Belchetz in his report with respect to Dr. Bautista\u2019s failure to record any objective diagnosis in her clinical notes and records, which are the foundation for the medical notes requesting accommodation that were provided to the Respondent.\n[23] The Respondent also points out that Dr. Belchetz had serious concerns that Dr. Bautista did not provide information to the Respondent or to the Ministry of Transportation indicating that the Complainant may not be fit to work or work safely.\n[24] The Respondent submitted that Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence was \u201cextremely relevant\u201d and contained information that was likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the Tribunal, and that it would assist the Tribunal to understand \u201c\u2026the medical notes and issues raised by the Complainant, and the Respondent\u2019s duty to accommodate or not, so that the Tribunal can have all the information necessary to objectively decide this matter.\u201d\n[25] The Respondent submitted that the Rules allow evidence and information that a court may decide not to allow.\n[26] The Respondent submits: \u201cFurther, an expert witness can be a doctor doing peer review. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s critique is of assistance to the Tribunal, and Rule 6(3) has been complied with. The Respondent should therefore be permitted to file its report at the hearing and defend itself fully.\u201d\n[27] The Respondent cites the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Kelsh v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2016 CHRT 9 (\u201cKelsh\u201d), at paras. 17 - 22, and the review of subsections 50(1) and (3)(c) and 48.9(1) of the Act, and Rule 1, as support for the Respondent\u2019s assertion that its submission of the evidence of Dr. Belchetz is consistent with its right to pursue a full and ample opportunity to appear, present evidence and make representations at the inquiry.\n[28] The Respondent cited a Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario ruling in Nassiah v. Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 HRTO 18 (CanLII), at para. 354, as support for the principle that:\nAny uncertainty about whether the evidence may be relevant should be resolved in favour of admitting it and allowing it to be tested through cross-examination. Admitting the evidence does not preclude the Tribunal from subsequently determining it has no relevance or assigning no weight to it\u2026.necessity is not to be judged by too strict a standard.\n[quoting from paras. 31 and 33 of Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. [2004] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 364]\n[29] Relying on Kelsh, the Respondent submits there is no prejudice to the Complainant because the Complainant had an opportunity to file a responding report but did not do so.\n[30] Citing and relying on First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Attorney General of Canada, 2012 CHRT 28 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d), at paras. 11, 14, 15, and 18, the Respondent submits that:\nissues with respect to the relevance and admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony are more properly decided when the witness is called. The panel member can then decide on what weight ought to be given to the evidence of the respective doctors. The Complainant\u2019s motion is premature, and ought to be dismissed.\n[31] In relation to the cases referred to in the Complainant\u2019s Motion, the Respondent dismissed them as not applicable given that they are decisions of a \u201cSuperior Court of Justice, which has a higher standard of admissibility than the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\u201d\n[32] The Respondent reiterated that Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence is relevant and necessary since the issues raised were likely outside the experience and knowledge of the Tribunal. The Respondent pointed out that Dr. Belchetz provided a signed Acknowledgement of Expert\u2019s Duty that he will provide an unbiased opinion, and that Dr. Bautista had not signed an Acknowledgement of Expert\u2019s Duty.\nV. Commission\u2019s Submissions to the Motion to Exclude Dr. Belchetz\u2019s Evidence\n[33] The Commission took no position on the merits of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence. The Commission noted that his report was filed as required by Rule 6. The Commission submitted the Tribunal must decide what weight to give to Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence.\n[34] The Commission further submitted that:\nTo dismiss the report[s] as requested by the Complainant would impose onerous obligations on parties before the Tribunal in future cases and would over judicialize the process before the Tribunal. Ultimately, it would be inconsistent with the necessary flexibility of the Tribunal\u2019s process and would create obstacles for unrepresented complainants in the future.\n[35] The Commission submitted that expert evidence can assist the trier of fact with necessary technical or scientific terminology or issues, to assist with the proper assessment of evidence.\n[36] The Commission referred to the comments of Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at para. 42, to suggest that the role of the expert is to provide the trier of fact with a ready-made inference which, due to the technical nature of the facts, the trier of fact is unable to formulate.\n[37] The Commission cited R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at para. 22, to support the submission that the expert evidence must be necessary for the trier of fact:\ni) to appreciate the facts due to their technical nature; or,\nii) to form a correct judgment on a matter if ordinary persons are unlikely to do so without the assistance of persons with special knowledge.\n[38] In relation to relevance, the Commission cited R. v. Pascoe (1997) 32 O.R. (3d) 37 (C.A.), at para. 27, to submit that even potentially relevant evidence may be excluded if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.\n[39] The Commission submitted that if Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report met the criteria for admissibility set out in case law and was filed in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules, then it should be admitted. At paragraph 11, the Commission states that if Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report does not deal with the specific issue before the Tribunal and it is not relevant or necessary, it still provides \u201ccontextual reality.\u201d\n[40] The Commission submits the Tribunal has the discretion to exclude relevant evidence if the probative value is misleading or the time required to introduce the evidence is disproportionate to its evidentiary value, as per R. v. Mohan.\n[41] The Commission submits the Complainant\u2019s motion cannot succeed without allowing for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence the witnesses will provide, and cites FNCFCS. The Commission submits: \u201cthe Rules do not contain a section to exclude an expert report and the Tribunal must be cautious not to resort to extraordinary measures such as striking out a large segment of a party\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n[42] The Commission also submits that the Tribunal only has 10 Rules whereas the Federal Court has over 500, which the Commission submits is based on subsection 48.9(1) of the Act: \u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d The Commission notes that the Superior Court Rules of provinces do not bind the Tribunal.\n[43] The Commission submits that Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report may support the Respondent with respect to the issue of safety that it raised in its SOP and ASOP and cites the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 131:\n[21] I agree with the Federal Court Judge that the Supreme Court of Canada was not intending to create a separate procedural right to accommodate. There is simply one question for the purposes of the third step of the test: has the employer \u201cdemonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer?\u201d Once the employer has established this, then it has satisfied the requirements of the third step. Assuming that the first two steps are also satisfied (which they were in this case), it is a bona fide occupational requirement and it is not a discriminatory practice.\nVI. CMCC Discussions regarding Expert Evidence and Motion to Exclude\n[44] During the CMCC on June 9, 2016, the Respondent expressed its belief that the Complainant did not have a disability as alleged in the complaint, and suggested that without a disability there could be no discriminatory practice. The Respondent explained that Dr. Belchetz was engaged to critique the notes and reports provided by Dr. Bautista to the Respondent, in terms of the lack of a diagnosed disability and the lack of concern about the Complainant\u2019s fitness to work or to work safely, in light of his reported symptoms. The Respondent acknowledges that its questions posed to Dr. Belchetz and Dr. Belchetz\u2019s replies are also noted in the Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP.\n[45] During the CMCC on July 20, 2016, the Respondent expressed the view that sections 48.9 and 50 of the Act give discretion to the Tribunal to include evidence, but not exclude evidence. The Respondent also submitted that if Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report was prepared and filed in compliance with Rule 6(3), then its admissibility was automatic and I had no authority to exclude the report. The Respondent was unaware that it was expected to qualify Dr. Belchetz as an expert within the scope of his expert opinion, which the Respondent classified as \u201cpeer review\u201d, and Dr. Belchetz classified as \u201cobjective subject matter.\u201d\n[46] The submissions of the Commission and the Respondent did not address the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision, White Burgess. The Respondent suggested that superior court decisions were not applicable to the Tribunal and did not believe White Burgess was applicable to the Tribunal.\n[47] The Respondent was agreeable to calling Dr. Belchetz to give viva voce evidence at the hearing as a non-expert. The Complainant wished to pursue the motion to exclude Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence, whether as a qualified expert or not, and asked the Tribunal to consider White Burgess.\nVII. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s Report and Curriculum Vitae\n[48] The Tribunal has reviewed Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report and his curriculum vitae. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report consists of a letter dated June 21, 2016 that was prepared in direct response to questions posed by Respondent\u2019s counsel. Dr. Belchetz states he is asked \u201c\u2026.as an objective subject matter expert, to answer the following questions with regard to Mr. Michael Christoforou and the clinical notes prepared by his physician, Dr. Bautista.\u201d Dr. Blechetz\u2019s answers appear in order below the questions.\n[49] The Respondent acknowledged during a CMCC that the questions Respondent\u2019s counsel posed to Dr. Belchetz are issues raised in the Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP and that the Respondent intends to pursue these issues in cross-examination of Dr. Bautista, and in its submissions.\n[50] The Respondent acknowledged that Dr. Belchetz did not examine or assess the Complainant, and that he was not retained by the Respondent in an advisory capacity during the period before and after the termination of the Complainant\u2019s employment.\n[51] The Respondent acknowledged that the purpose of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence is to present some of the concerns raised in the Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP through the opinion evidence of a medical professional.\nVIII. Relevant Legislation, Caselaw and Rules\n[52] The first issue I will address is the Respondent\u2019s submission that Superior Court decisions regarding expert opinion evidence do not apply to the CHRT. The Respondent asserts that because of the administrative\/non-judicial nature of the Tribunal, the Act only empowers the Tribunal to permit evidence that may not be admissible in a court and not to exclude evidence (aside from privileged communication which is expressly prohibited in subsection 50(4) of the Act).\n[53] The Commission\u2019s similar submission was that the Tribunal should not conduct its proceedings in a manner similar to a court, because this would make it too difficult for self-represented individuals. The Commission urged the Tribunal to admit the expert evidence and assess its weight after the hearing, in order to protect the Respondent\u2019s right to make a full and ample presentation of its case.\n[54] The Commission and the Respondent referred to the following sections of the Act to argue for a very low threshold of admissibility - or no threshold at all:\n48.9 (1) Proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n(2) The Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal, including, but not limited to, rules governing\n(a) the giving of notices to parties;\n(b) the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings;\n(c) the summoning of witnesses;\n(d) the production and service of documents;\n(e) discovery proceedings;\n(f) pre-hearing conferences;\n(g) the introduction of evidence;\n(h) time limits within which hearings must be held and decisions must be made; and,\n(i) awards of interest.\n[\u2026.]\n50. (1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n(2) In the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\n(3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(a) in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint;\n(b) administer oaths;\n(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law;\n(d) lengthen or shorten any time limit established by the rules of procedure; and,\n(e) decide any procedural or evidentiary question arising during the hearing.\n(4) The member or panel may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence.\n[55] Subsection 50(2) empowers the Tribunal to decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determine the matter. Subsection 50(3)(a) states the Tribunal may act in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record to compel witnesses and order production and disclosure necessary for a full hearing. Subsection 50(3)(c) empowers the Tribunal to receive and accept any evidence or other information that the member or panel sees fit.\n[56] In light of Tribunal decisions and Superior Court decisions reviewed herein, I conclude there is no support for the Respondent\u2019s submission that section 50 permits the Tribunal to admit evidence, and that the Tribunal has no authority to exclude evidence.\n[57] The Commission agrees that Supreme Court of Canada decisions Abbey and Mohan are applicable to the Tribunal. The Commission quoted Tribunal rulings that considered and applied Mohan. White Burgess expanded upon Abbey and Mohan and I find that it is applicable to the Tribunal.\n[58] The real issue is whether the Tribunal can rule on admissibility before the hearing commences or, if the Act requires all arguably relevant evidence, including expert evidence, to be admitted, and at the end of the hearing, decide what weight, if any, to give such evidence.\n[59] The present matter is scheduled to be heard at the end of August 2016. The expert opinion evidence of Dr. Belchetz was commissioned in June 2016, after the Respondent was granted an adjournment of the second week of the hearing in June to August 2016. The Complainant wants a ruling regarding admissibility as soon as possible so he can determine the presentation of his case.\n[60] The Act allows the Tribunal to decide procedural and admissibility issues in a manner that is consistent with the principles of natural justice for all parties. Rulings by the Tribunal must balance the rights of all parties to a full and procedurally fair hearing.\n[61] The Act and procedural fairness will often prompt the Tribunal to allow the ongoing introduction of issues and motions by parties, beyond the dates set for same, and the abridgement of the Rules, to ensure all parties have an opportunity to know the case they need to meet and to respond fully. All arguably relevant evidence from fact, observation and participation witnesses is usually admitted in keeping with the scheme of the Act, specifically subsections 50(1) and 50(3)(a). It is customary to determine weight of evidence at the conclusion of the hearing rather than limit or restrict fact evidence any party wishes to present, so long as it is arguably relevant.\n[62] Expert opinion evidence, and opinion evidence in general, is different from fact evidence. The rationale for this was explained in R. v. Abbey, 1982 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at p. 42:\nOpinion Evidence\nWitnesses testify as to facts. The judge or jury draws inferences from the facts. \"In the law of evidence 'opinion' means any inference from observed fact, and the law on the subject derives from the general rule that witnesses must speak only to that which was directly observed by them\" (Cross on Evidence, supra, at p. 442). Where it is possible to separate fact from inference the witness may only testify as to fact. It is not always possible, however, to do so and the \"law makes allowances for these borderline cases by permitting witnesses to state their opinion with regard to matters not calling for special knowledge whenever it would be virtually impossible for them to separate their inferences from the facts on which those inferences are based\" (ibid.)\nWith respect to matters calling for special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate. \"An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary\" (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)\n[63] In some cases, the Tribunal has deferred a ruling on the admissibility of expert opinion evidence to the time the evidence is called (e.g. FNCFCS). If, however, the concerns regarding admissibility of expert opinion evidence can be assessed and determined by a review of the report, the ruling can be made before the expert witness is called to testify or before hearing the evidence of the expert witness: Brooks v. Fisheries and Oceans, 2004 CHRT 20 (\u201cBrooks\u201d); Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2006 CHRT 40 (\u201cGaucher\u201d); and, Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Minister of Personnel for the Government of the Northwest Territories, 2001 CanLII 25850 (CHRT) (\u201cPSAC\u201d).\n[64] In PSAC, the Tribunal considered Supreme Court of Canada decisions regarding expert opinion evidence when deciding a motion for leave to call more than the five expert witnesses permitted under the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5. I will quote the portions of the PSAC ruling that confirm the Tribunal has, despite the clear language of subsection 50(3)(c), chosen to follow superior court and appeal court decisions in civil and criminal proceedings with respect to expert witnesses:\n[2] The Respondent has also referred us to two authorities: R. v. Mohan [1994] S.C.J. No. 36, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 and R. v. Morin [1991] O.J. No. 2528 (Ont. Gen. Div.). These are criminal cases. The Morin decision merely holds that there must be a reasonable basis for calling expert witnesses. The Mohan case deals with the factors to be applied in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. These factors include the relevance of the evidence and whether the trier of fact needs to hear the evidence in order to determine the facts of the case.\n[3] Alan Mewett and Peter Sankoff have written that the general role of expert witnesses \"differs from that of the ordinary lay witness in that the former gives testimony in order to assist the fact finder in coming to a conclusion from the facts before him or her, whereas the latter testifies as to those very facts.\" (1) Mewett and Sankoff advise that the use of expert witnesses \"is as old as the trial process itself.\" (2) They suggest that there have been two concerns, historically, with respect to the use of such testimony. One is that it complicates the trial process, by introducing \"redundant and superfluous\" evidence. The other is that the weight of expert testimony is easily overstated and may undermine the role of the trier of fact. Although the courts have wavered on the issue, they \"have generally attempted to restrict the use of expert evidence to instances where it is truly required.\" (3)\n[4] The judgment in Mohan sets out some of the general principles in the area. The purpose of expert evidence is to assist an adjudicative body in deciding the facts of the case. It does so by providing the trier of facts with knowledge and \"ready-made\" inferences which stand outside the scope of their experience. It follows that experts have a special role in litigation which relies on statistical and scientific evidence. The issue in each instance is whether the evidence is \"necessary\" to decide the issues in the case. The standard of necessity is relatively relaxed, however, and should not be overstated. Mr. Justice Sopinka also remarks, at paragraph 24, that a trial should not become \"a contest of experts with the trier of fact acting as referee in deciding which experts to accept.\"\n[6] Counsel for the Respondent appeared to take the position that the relevant question is whether the proposed evidence would have a significant bearing on a distinct issue in the case. We agree with this view of the matter. A Tribunal is not in a position to assess the reliability of proposed witnesses at this stage of the proceeding and can merely determine whether their testimony would logically contribute to the defence. It is accordingly sufficient if it can be reasonably said that the expert's testimony is needed to determine one of the factual issues in the case. This excludes testimony which undermines the fairness or expeditiousness of the process.\n[16] The appearance of justice is important in our law and the Tribunal must be seen as the author of its own decisions. Under section 50(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, a Tribunal has the authority to decide \"all questions of law or fact necessary\" to determining the matter before it. That task has been assigned to the members of this Tribunal. We have an obligation to make up our own minds on legal issues and cannot delegate that responsibility to expert witnesses, however learned they may be. The courts have always expressed concern with expert evidence that crosses into issues more properly decided by the trier of the case.\n[17] We do not want to prevent the parties from arguing all matters of law that are relevant to a determination of the case. There is nothing to stop the Respondent from submitting a written brief on the international law, if that law is properly before us. It may also retain experts, and perhaps the experts in question, for the purpose of briefing counsel. The law is the province of counsel and the Tribunal, however, and we are firmly of the view that it should be raised in argument, rather than as expert or opinion evidence. We leave it to the Respondent to decide who will present these arguments before us.\n[20] We accept that Mr. Weiler testified as an expert witness in P.S.A.C. v. Canada Post. The Respondent did not explain, however, why it needed his evidence to answer the complaint before us. It will be apparent that we do not feel it would be appropriate to elicit his opinion of the law. In our view, the Respondent has accordingly failed to demonstrate that the evidence of Mr. Weiler would assist the Tribunal in deciding the facts of the case.\n[65] Expert witnesses should only assist the Tribunal with drawing inferences on technical facts beyond the knowledge of the Tribunal, and expert witnesses should not give opinion evidence on legal issues that are within the mandate of and expertise of the Tribunal. The Tribunal will consider whether the expert opinion evidence is presented for the purpose of usurping the Tribunal\u2019s role to decide the \u201cfundamental issue\u201d in the case: Brooks, para. 13; and, Gaucher, para. 12.\n[66] In Keith v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2015 CHRT 4 (\u201cKeith\u201d), the Tribunal ruled on a motion to exclude expert opinion evidence and noted that, notwithstanding s. 50(3)(c) of the Act, Mohan and Abbey were applicable to the Tribunal:\n[21] This motion is brought by the Respondent to exclude David Jacobs as an expert witness as part of the Complainant\u2019s case. The Respondent alleges that expert evidence should only be admitted if the matter in issue requires specialized expertise to assist the Tribunal to understand the factual matter to reach a proper conclusion.\n[22] The Complainant\u2019s position is that Mr. Jacob\u2019s report (the Report) is necessary to assist the Tribunal in evaluating the Respondent\u2019s claim that Royal College certification is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) for the position sought by the Complainant; and further, that the report is of a technical subject matter not within the expertise or knowledge of the Tribunal.\n[23] The Complainant\u2019s Motion materials state that the Report provides detailed information about the regulation of doctors by the CPSO, its role, its powers and its duty to the public. It addresses the issue of CPSO recognition of specialists and how this relates to certification from the RCPSC.\n[24] The Respondent claims, at page 2 of its Motion Record, that the opinion evidence \u201cconsists primarily of a recitation of the statutory and regulatory framework for medical regulation\u201d and that the report is \u201cakin to calling expert evidence on domestic legal issues\u201d which is \u201cnot outside the experience and knowledge of this CHRT.\u201d\n[25] The Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.H-6, section (50)(3)(c) provides the Tribunal a more generous latitude in the admission of evidence as would otherwise be in a court of law. Nevertheless, both parties have referred to the leading case of R. v. Mohan 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), which at paragraph 17 states that the admission of expert opinion evidence depends on the application of the following criteria: (a) relevance; (b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (c) the absence of any exclusionary rule; and (d) a properly qualified expert. The Mohan decision makes reference to the earlier decision of R. v. Abbey, 1982 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1982] 2 SCR 24, as being illustrative of the necessity requirement.\n[26] I believe that the Tribunal should follow the interpretation of Dickson J., in R. v. Abbey that the [opinion expert] evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature. For the expert evidence to be admissible it must be such that \u201cordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment about it if unassisted by persons with special knowledge\u201d (see Beven on Negligence (4th ed. 1928), cited in Mohan and Rosin v. Canadian Armed Forces 1989 CanLII 149 (CHRT), aff\u2019d [1991] 1 F.C. 391 (C.A.)). \u201cMere helpfulness\u201d is too low a standard to warrant accepting the dangers inherent in the admission of expert evidence\u201d (see R. v. D.D. 2000 SCC 43, at para. 47, referring to Mohan and Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 CHRT 46 (CanLII), at para. 8.)\n[27] The Complainant has suggested that the Tribunal\u2019s area of experience and knowledge is limited by being specific to interpreting whether discrimination has occurred and providing the appropriate remedy. He cites Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2006 CHRT 40 (CanLII), as authority for this assertion. As a result, in the complainant\u2019s view, Dr. Jacobs\u2019 report is outside the experience and technical knowledge of the Tribunal.\n[28] Section 50(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, provides that \u201c[i]n the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\u201d I believe the Tribunal\u2019s determination as to the appropriateness of receiving expert opinion evidence on the law was best stated in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 26., at paragraphs 16 and 17. The Tribunal is charged with deciding issues of fact and law and should not delegate this responsibility to expert witnesses: \u201c[t]he law is the province of counsel and the Tribunal,...it should be raised in argument rather than as expert or opinion evidence.\u201d\n[29] I agree with the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Report as consisting primarily of a recitation of the statutory and regulatory frameworks. I believe that the test established in Mohan has not been met. Dr. Jacob\u2019s Report is not outside the knowledge and experience of the Tribunal, and the issues of law discussed therein should not be delegated to an expert witness, as was stated in Northwest Territories above.\n[30] For the above reasons, I Order Dr. Jacob\u2019s Report not be admitted as evidence.\n[67] In Croteau v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2014 CHRT 16 (\u201cCroteau\u201d), the Tribunal was asked to qualify an expert to give expert opinion evidence. The relevant portions of the ruling are as follows:\n[67] The Complainant sought to have Dr. AB qualified to give expert opinion evidence about the following: \u201canxiety disorder; PTSD; adjustment disorder; panic attacks and the impact of those on individuals and specifically Mr. Croteau; causation of these disorders; ability of people with PTSD to RTW generally and specifically Mr. Croteau; what things need to be put in place for a RTW for the Complainant; [and to] comment on Dr. Chad\u2019s IMEs.\u201d\n[68] CN\u2019s counsel opposed the request to have Dr. AB qualified as an expert. He did not oppose his giving testimony as the Complainant\u2019s treating psychologist, although he submits that the Tribunal should be \u201creluctant to rely on anything he said. CN\u2019s reasons for its position are:\ni. Dr. [AB]\u2019s diagnosis of Mr. Croteau is by his own admission at odds with the requirements of the DSM-IV[11] and with the prevailing opinion in the psychiatric\/psychological [sic] professional (at least with respect to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder);\nii. his professional relationship with Mr. Croteau has crossed the line into an unrestricted advocacy on behalf of Mr. Croteau, and he does not have the objectivity that adjudicators require of medical professionals; and\niii. Dr. [AB] in his evidence refused to change his view or opinion even when he became aware that the facts upon which he originally formed the opinion were different from what he understood.\n[69] Based on the second and third submission above, I decline to qualify Dr. AB to give expert opinion evidence on the matters requested. However, his evidence as Mr. Croteau\u2019s treating psychologist will be considered and given appropriate weight.\n[70] In coming to this conclusion, I have reviewed the leading Supreme Court of Canada Judgment dealing with the nature and admissibility of expert evidence \u2013 R. v. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 \u2013 and its four criteria. Interestingly, the criteria do not include a stand-alone requirement of independence and impartiality. However, Canadian courts have inferred the same: see for example R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII), at para. 87, footnote 8, leave to appeal denied [2010], S.C.C.A. No. 125; and Es-Sayyid v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FCA 59 (CanLII), at para. 43, leave to appeal denied [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 116.\n[68] The review of Tribunal decisions Brooks, Gaucher, PSAC, Keith and Croteau that apply Abbey and Mohan, confirms that, notwithstanding s. 50(3)(c) of the Act, the following principles apply to expert opinion evidence under the CHRT:\nWhite Burgess applies to the Tribunal as an elaboration of the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in Abbey and Mohan;\nThe Tribunal must assess whether the purported expert opinion evidence is necessary, due to the technical or scientific nature of the facts, for the Tribunal to draw the inference regarding the facts or to make the legal determination required. If the factual evidence presented is sufficient for the Tribunal to draw its own inferences and conclusions, without the expert\u2019s opinion evidence, then the expert opinion evidence is unnecessary;\nThe Tribunal is not obligated to allow all expert opinion evidence proffered by the parties and then decide later on weight and acceptance. If the issues and concerns regarding admissibility are apparent with a simple reading of the report then the criteria for admissibility can be assessed without hearing the evidence of the proposed expert to determine admissibility;\nThe Tribunal must decide whether the proposed expert opinion evidence meets the preconditions to admissibility set out in Mohan, Abbey and White Burgess; and\nThe Tribunal must also consider the cost-benefit analysis of whether allowing the evidence outweighs any risk of harm to the integrity of the hearing by 1) unfairness to the other party, i.e., is the other party able to cross-examine the expert or introduce evidence to address adverse expert opinion evidence?; 2) does the expert opinion evidence purport to usurp the adjudicator function to assess credibility, find facts and determine the factual and legal issues; and, 3) will the expert evidence lengthen the hearing, cause delay and increase legal and other costs?\n[69] I reviewed several superior court decisions rendered subsequent to White Burgess to understand the court\u2019s interpretation and application of White Burgess. I note several informative decisions below.\n[70] Kon Construction Ltd. v. Terranova Developments Ltd., 2015 ABCA 249 (CanLII) (\u201cKon Construction\u201d), illustrates the application of White Burgess at paras. 21, 30, and 35-38:\n[21] Opinion evidence is presumptively inadmissible, [subsection 50(3)(c) and (4) of the Act means there is no presumptively inadmissible evidence except for privileged communication at the CHRT] subject to a few exceptions. The most important exception is for expert opinion evidence on matters requiring specialized knowledge: White Burgess Langille Inman v Abbott and Haliburton Co. [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at paras. 14-5, 470 NR 324. In the case of an opinion based on novel or contested science or science used for a novel purpose, the reliability of the underlying science for that purpose must also be shown: White Burgess at para. 23. At the other end of the spectrum, there are \u201copinions\u201d that are merely compilations of ordinary observations, and they are admissible even through a lay witness: Graat v The Queen, 1982 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819. The law of evidence performs an overall cost\/benefit analysis of the opinion evidence, comparing it to the potential harm to the trial process that may flow from the admission of the evidence: White Burgess at para. 24.\n[\u2026]\nEvidence from Witnesses with Expertise\n[30] When expert evidence is to be used, the Rules of Court require that the parties give notice to their opponents. When the witness is called, the trial judge will hear submissions and apply the test in R. v Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R 9 to determine if the witness is qualified to give expert opinion evidence. The proposed evidence must be necessary to assist the trier of fact. The trial judge must also decide if the witness qualifies as having the necessary special knowledge. Once qualified, the expert witness will be permitted to give opinion evidence.\n[\u2026]\n[35] Thus, there would appear to be at least three categories of \u201cwitnesses with expertise\u201d, who in some respects are witnesses of fact, and in other respects opinion witnesses:\n(a) Independent experts who are retained to provide opinions about issues in the litigation, but were not otherwise involved in the underlying events. This is the category of expert witness contemplated by White Burgess and Mohan.\n(b) Witnesses with expertise who were involved in the events underlying the litigation, but are not themselves litigants. An example is the family physician in a personal injury case who is called upon to testify about his or her observations of the plaintiff, and the treatment provided.\n(c) Litigants (including the officers and employees of corporate litigants) who have expertise, and who were actually involved in the events underlying the litigation. Marinus Scheffer and Klaver fall into this category.\nThe rules of evidence and civil procedure relating to expert witnesses are primarily designed to deal with the first category of expert witness.\n[36] The first category of \u201cindependent experts\u201d must always be qualified by the trial judge under the Mohan procedure, and advance notice of their opinions must be given under the Rules of Court. External witnesses who are not so qualified are not permitted to give opinion evidence requiring specialized expertise. External expert witnesses are expected to display a basic level of independence and objectivity.\n[37] It is sometimes argued that the evidence of witnesses in the second category is not \u201copinion\u201d evidence: Westerhof at paras. 60-1. To some extent they are testifying about what they observed, and what they actually did. In that sense, they are not opinion witnesses. On the other hand, it is challenging for them to explain why they acted as they did without engaging their professional expertise. For example, the family doctor cannot explain why he or she endorsed any particular treatment without expressing a medical opinion about it. It is difficult to set the boundary between what they did and their expert opinions about what should have been done. Where witnesses with expertise (who are not litigants) are to testify about events within the scope of their expertise, it is generally prudent to have them formally qualified as expert witnesses, particularly when they propose to express opinions on collateral issues like the employment prospects of the patient. Further, the overall objective of comprehensive disclosure found in R. 5.1(1)(c & d) supports the pre-trial disclosure of the opinions of participating experts.\n[38] The final category of litigant-witnesses with expertise does not fall neatly into the White Burgess and Mohan analysis. First of all, it is unnecessary to prove that such a witness is \u201cimpartial, independent, and unbiased\u201d as discussed in White Burgess. Litigants are no longer disqualified as witnesses because of their obvious interest in the case.\n[71] In Allard v. Canada, 2016 FC 236 (CanLII) (\u201cAllard\u201d), at paras. 102 and 103, the Federal Court considered the evolution of the Supreme Court of Canada rulings on expert opinion evidence, culminating with White Burgess:\n[102] It is important to recognize the standard necessary for admission of expert opinion evidence:\n50 Courts must be vigilant to guard against such impermissible evidence. It is trite law that expert witnesses should not give opinion evidence on matters for which they possess no special skill, knowledge or training, nor on matters that are commonplace, for which no special skill, knowledge or training is required.\n(Johnson v Milton (Town), 2008 ONCA 440 (CanLII))\n[103] In the leading case, R v Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 SCR 9 [Mohan], the Supreme Court provided criteria on the admission of expert evidence that advances a novel scientific theory. Although the experts in the present trial did not advance a novel scientific theory, and the expert qualifications were not objected to during the course of the trial, it is still necessary to evaluate their probative value. Since Mohan, the courts have provided guidance on this evaluation.\n[72] In Anderson v. Pieters, 2016 BCSC 889 (CanLII), at paras. 42-44 and 49, the Court referred to the leading cases regarding admissibility of expert evidence and summarized the evolution up to and including White Burgess:\n[42] Finally, in White Burgess, supra, the Court advanced the law governing admissibility of expert opinion in two respects. First, the Court articulated a new initial threshold test, aimed at ensuring an expert\u2019s independence and impartiality. An expert\u2019s attestation in a written report to having understood their duty to the court, or their testifying on oath to that effect, will shift to the opposing party the burden of demonstrating realistic concern that the opinion should not be admitted because the expert witness is unable or unwilling to comply with that duty. If the opposing party does so, the burden of establishing independence and impartiality will remain on the party proposing to tender the opinion evidence. Exclusion at this threshold stage, however, will only occur:\n\u2026 in very clear cases in which the proposed expert is unable or unwilling to provide the court with fair, objective and non-partisan evidence.\n(White Burgess at para. 49).\n[43] If the opinion passes this initial threshold test, the trial judge is then to determine admissibility under a reformulated analytical framework, in which the gatekeeper function has two steps. The first step is the application of the four Mohan criteria of relevance \u2013 relevance, necessity, the absence of any exclusionary rule, and a properly qualified expert \u2013 supplemented by a fifth criterion, applied in the case of novel or contested science, of reliability of the underlying science.\n[44] The second step entails the balancing exercise or cost-benefit analysis. Justice Cromwell endorsed the description of the process formulated by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII), at para. 76:\n\u2026 the trial judge must decide whether expert evidence that meets the preconditions to admissibility is sufficiently beneficial to the trial process to warrant its admission despite the potential harm to the trial process that may flow from the admission of the expert evidence.\n[45] Justice Cromwell described the weighing of evidence at this stage in the following terms:\n\u2026 relevance, necessity, reliability and absence of bias can helpfully be seen as part of a sliding scale where a basic level must first be achieved in order to meet the admissibility threshold and thereafter continue to play a role in weighing the overall competing considerations in admitting the evidence.\nIt is at this second stage of the gatekeeper function that any residual concerns as to independence and impartiality \u2013 those which have arisen out of anything less than clear unwillingness or inability \u2013 are to be addressed (White Burgess at paras. 49, 54).\n[49] To summarize, the first step of the gatekeeping analysis involves consideration of four factors - relevance, necessity, the absence of any exclusionary rule, and a properly qualified expert \u2013 and a fifth factor applied to opinions relying upon novel or contested science, reliability. An expert opinion that raises sufficiently strong concerns with respect to any one of those factors \u2013 e.g. that the opinion is clearly not relevant, or that it is clearly not necessary in order for the jurors, equipped with their own experience, to draw appropriate inferences from the evidence \u2013 is to be excluded. The second step then involves consideration of not only all of those factors, but also any other concerns with respect to the weight of the evidence that potentially put at risk the ability of the jury to discharge its function in a proper manner, when consideration is given to the potential costs or prejudicial effects. These other concerns include matters such as reliability, qualifications, independence and bias. The point of the analysis is not to usurp the jury\u2019s function of weighing the evidence, but to assist the jury by ensuring, to the greatest possible extent, that the evidence that comes before them may be properly weighed in the course of the jury appropriately and efficiently discharging its duty.\n[73] In addition, I will quote paragraphs below from White Burgess that, in my view, are relevant to this analysis:\n(2) The Current Legal Framework for Expert Opinion Evidence\n[16] Since at least the mid-1990s, the Court has responded to a number of concerns about the impact on the litigation process of expert evidence of dubious value. The jurisprudence has clarified and tightened the threshold requirements for admissibility, added new requirements in order to assure reliability, particularly of novel scientific evidence, and emphasized the important role that judges should play as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to screen out proposed evidence whose value does not justify the risk of confusion, time and expense that may result from its admission. [1] Expert opinion evidence can be a key element in the search for truth, but it may also pose special dangers. To guard against them, the Court over the last 20 years or so has progressively tightened the rules of admissibility and enhanced the trial judge\u2019s gatekeeping role. These developments seek to ensure that expert opinion evidence meets certain basic standards before it is admitted. \u2026..\n[17] We can take as the starting point for these developments the Court\u2019s decision in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. That case described the potential dangers of expert evidence and established a fourpart threshold test for admissibility. The dangers are well known. One is that the trier of fact will inappropriately defer to the expert\u2019s opinion rather than carefully evaluate it. \u2026..\n[18] The point is to preserve trial by judge and jury, not devolve to trial by expert. There is a risk that the jury \u201cwill be unable to make an effective and critical assessment of the evidence\u201d: R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, 97 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 90, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 2 S.C.R. v. The trier of fact must be able to use its \u201cinformed judgment\u201d, not simply decide on the basis of an \u201cact of faith\u201d in the expert\u2019s opinion: J.-L.J., at para. 56. The risk of \u201cattornment to the opinion of the expert\u201d is also exacerbated by the fact that expert evidence is resistant to effective cross-examination by counsel who are not experts in that field: D.D., at para. 54. The cases address a number of other related concerns: the potential prejudice created by the expert\u2019s reliance on unproven material not subject to cross examination (D.D., at para. 55); the risk of admitting \u201cjunk science\u201d (J.-L.J., at para. 25); and the risk that a \u201ccontest of experts\u201d distracts rather than assists the trier of fact (Mohan, at p. 24). Another well known danger associated with the admissibility of expert evidence is that it may lead to an inordinate expenditure of time and money: Mohan, at p. 21; D.D., at para. 56; Masterpiece Inc. v. Alavida Lifestyles Inc., 2011 SCC 27, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 387, at para. 76.\n[19] To address these dangers, Mohan established a basic structure for the law relating to the admissibility of expert opinion evidence. That structure has two main components. First, there are four threshold requirements that the proponent of the evidence must establish in order for proposed expert opinion evidence to be admissible: (1) relevance; (2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (3) absence of an exclusionary rule; and (4) a properly qualified expert (Mohan, at pp. 20-25; see also Sekhon, at para. 43). Mohan also underlined the important role of trial judges in assessing whether otherwise admissible expert evidence should be excluded because its probative value was overborne by its prejudicial effect \u2014 a residual discretion to exclude evidence based on a cost-benefit analysis: p. 21. This is the second component, which the subsequent jurisprudence has further emphasized: Lederman, Bryant and Fuerst, at pp. 789-90; J.-L.J., at para. 28.\n[20] Mohan and the jurisprudence since, however, have not explicitly addressed how this \u201ccost benefit\u201d component fits into the overall analysis. The reasons in Mohan engaged in a cost-benefit analysis with respect to particular elements of the four threshold requirements, but they also noted that the cost-benefit analysis could be an aspect of exercising the overall discretion to exclude evidence whose probative value does not justify its admission in light of its potentially prejudicial effects: p. 21. The jurisprudence since Mohan has also focused on particular aspects of expert opinion evidence, but again without always being explicit about where additional concerns fit into the analysis. The unmistakable overall trend of the jurisprudence, however, has been to tighten the admissibility requirements and to enhance the judge\u2019s gatekeeping role.\n[21] So, for example, the necessity threshold criterion was emphasized in cases such as D.D. The majority underlined that the necessity requirement exists \u201cto ensure that the dangers associated with expert evidence are not lightly tolerated\u201d and that \u201c[m]ere relevance or \u2018helpfulness\u2019 is not enough\u201d: para. 46. Other cases have addressed the reliability of the science underlying an opinion and indeed technical evidence in general: J.-L.J.; R. v. Trochym, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239. The question remains, however, as to where the cost-benefit analysis and concerns such as those about reliability fit into the overall analysis.\n[22] Abbey (ONCA) introduced helpful analytical clarity by dividing the inquiry into two steps. With minor adjustments, I would adopt that approach.\n[23] At the first step, the proponent of the evidence must establish the threshold requirements of admissibility. These are the four Mohan factors (relevance, necessity, absence of an exclusionary rule and a properly qualified expert) and in addition, in the case of an opinion based on novel or contested science or science used for a novel purpose, the reliability of the underlying science for that purpose: J.-L.J., at paras. 33, 35-36 and 47; Trochym, at para. 27; Lederman, Bryant and Fuerst, at pp. 788-89 and 800-801. Relevance at this threshold stage refers to logical relevance: Abbey (ONCA), at para. 82; J.-L.J., at para. 47. Evidence that does not meet these threshold requirements should be excluded. Note that I would retain necessity as a threshold requirement: D.D., at para. 57; see D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (7th ed. 2015), at pp. 209-10; R. v. Boswell, 2011 ONCA 283, 85 C.R. (6th) 290, at para. 13; R. v. C. (M.), 2014 ONCA 611, 13 C.R. (7th) 396, at para. 72.\n[24] At the second discretionary gatekeeping step, the judge balances the potential risks and benefits of admitting the evidence in order to decide whether the potential benefits justify the risks. The required balancing exercise has been described in various ways. In Mohan, Sopinka J. spoke of the \u201creliability versus effect factor\u201d (p. 21), while in J.-L.J., Binnie J. spoke about \u201crelevance, reliability and necessity\u201d being \u201cmeasured against the counterweights of consumption of time, prejudice and confusion\u201d: para. 47. Doherty J.A. summed it up well in Abbey, stating that the \u201ctrial judge must decide whether expert evidence that meets the preconditions to admissibility is sufficiently beneficial to the trial process to warrant its admission despite the potential harm to the trial process that may flow from the admission of the expert evidence\u201d: para. 76.\n[25] With this delineation of the analytical framework, we can turn to the nature of an expert\u2019s duty to the court and where it fits into that framework.\n[32] Underlying the various formulations of the duty are three related concepts: impartiality, independence and absence of bias. The expert\u2019s opinion must be impartial in the sense that it reflects an objective assessment of the questions at hand. It must be independent in the sense that it is the product of the expert\u2019s independent judgment, uninfluenced by who has retained him or her or the outcome of the litigation. It must be unbiased in the sense that it does not unfairly favour one party\u2019s position over another. The acid test is whether the expert\u2019s opinion would not change regardless of which party retained him or her: P. Michell and R. Mandhane, \u201cThe Uncertain Duty of the Expert Witness\u201d (2005), 42 Alta. L. Rev. 635, at pp. 638-39. These concepts, of course, must be applied to the realities of adversary litigation. Experts are generally retained, instructed and paid by one of the adversaries. These facts alone do not undermine the expert\u2019s independence, impartiality and freedom from bias.\n[34] In this section, I will explain my view that the answer to both questions is yes: a proposed expert\u2019s independence and impartiality go to admissibility and not simply to weight and there is a threshold admissibility requirement in relation to this duty. Once that threshold is met, remaining concerns about the expert\u2019s compliance with his or her duty should be considered as part of the overall cost-benefit analysis which the judge conducts to carry out his or her gatekeeping role.\n[\u2026]\n[45] Following what I take to be the dominant view in the Canadian cases, I would hold that an expert\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality goes to the admissibility of the evidence in addition to being considered in relation to the weight to be given to the evidence if admitted. That approach seems to me to be more in line with the basic structure of our law relating to expert evidence and with the importance our jurisprudence has attached to the gatekeeping role of trial judges. Binnie J. summed up the Canadian approach well in J.-L.J.: \u201cThe admissibility of the expert evidence should be scrutinized at the time it is proffered, and not allowed too easy an entry on the basis that all of the frailties could go at the end of the day to weight rather than admissibility\u201d (para. 28).\n[\u2026]\n[49] This threshold requirement is not particularly onerous and it will likely be quite rare that a proposed expert\u2019s evidence would be ruled inadmissible for failing to me of the proposed expert and the substance of the proposed evidence, whether the expert is able and willing to carry out his or her primary duty to the court. For example, it is the nature and extent of the interest or connection with the litigation or a party thereto which matters, not the mere fact of the interest or connection; the existence of some interest or a relationship does not automatically render the evidence of the proposed expert inadmissible. In most cases, a mere employment relationship with the party calling the evidence will be insufficient to do so. On the other hand, a direct financial interest in the outcome of the litigation will be of more concern. The same can be said in the case of a very close familial relationship with one of the parties or situations in which the proposed expert will probably incur professional liability if his or her opinion is not accepted by the court. Similarly, an expert who, in his or her proposed evidence or otherwise, assumes the role of an advocate for a party is clearly unwilling and\/or unable to carry out the primary duty to the court. I emphasize that exclusion at the threshold stage of the analysis should occur only in very clear cases in which the proposed expert is unable or unwilling to provide the court with fair, objective and non-partisan evidence. Anything less than clear unwillingness or inability to do so should not lead to exclusion, but be taken into account in the overall weighing of costs and benefits of receiving the evidence.\n[\u2026]\n(2) The Gatekeeping Exclusionary Discretion\n[54] Finding that expert evidence meets the basic threshold does not end the inquiry. Consistent with the structure of the analysis developed following Mohan which I have discussed earlier, the judge must still take concerns about the expert\u2019s independence and impartiality into account in weighing the evidence at the gatekeeping stage. At this point, relevance, necessity, reliability and absence of bias can helpfully be seen as part of a sliding scale where a basic level must first be achieved in order to meet the admissibility threshold and thereafter continue to play a role in w the day, the judge must be satisfied that the potential helpfulness of the evidence is not outweighed by the risk of the dangers materializing that are associated with expert evidence.\nIX. Analysis\n[74] I confirm the analysis set out in White Burgess is applicable to the Tribunal in the context of the Act. Previous Tribunal adjudicators balanced Mohan and Abbey with the Act and I am informed and guided by those rulings in this White Burgess analysis. It is my obligation under the Act to thoroughly analyze Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report and qualifications presented in his curriculum vitae, in accordance with White Burgess, to determine whether Dr. Belchetz should give expert opinion evidence or any evidence at the hearing.\nA. Independence and Impartiality\n[75] Dr. Belchetz signed an Acknowledgement of Expert\u2019s Duty, acknowledging his duty to provide fair, objective, non-partisan opinion evidence, and to provide opinion evidence that is related only to matters that are within his area of expertise. The Complainant submits that notwithstanding the Acknowledgement is signed, Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report is not independent or impartial.\n[76] Dr. Belchetz is a medical doctor retained by the Respondent solely for the purpose of this hearing which, pursuant to para. 35 of Kon Construction, is the type of expert opinion evidence to which White Burgess applies, given that the risk of harm to the proceeding is greater with \u201clitigation experts.\u201d\n[77] Dr. Belchetz acknowledges he has not met or talked to the Complainant or Dr. Bautista. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s comments in his letter dated June 21, 2016 are in direct response to Respondent counsel\u2019s pointed, leading questions, which the Respondent acknowledges suggest the same criticisms of Dr. Bautista as stated in its SOP and ASOP. Dr. Belchetz agrees with and supports the Respondent\u2019s questions regarding deficiencies in Dr. Bautista\u2019s standard of care, diagnostic process, notes, reports and record keeping.\n[78] Dr. Belchetz offers no spontaneous, independent observations or opinions. His evidence does not appear to be \u201c\u2026the product of the expert\u2019s independent judgment, uninfluenced by who has retained him\u2026.\u201d Dr. Belchetz\u2019s agreement with the Respondent\u2019s criticisms of Dr. Bautista seems to be self-serving and advocates for the Respondent\u2019s position.\nB. Relevance and Necessity in assisting the Trier of Fact\n[79] The Respondent and the Commission submit Dr. Belchetz\u2019s expert opinion evidence may be relevant and necessary for the Respondent to fully respond to the complaint and to advance any explanation or justification for its employment practices.\n[80] I will consider Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report and the relevant legislation and case law to determine if Dr. Belchetz\u2019s opinion evidence is arguably relevant to either issue and can help advance the Respondent\u2019s case without usurping my role as the adjudicator of this case.\n[81] This complaint is made under sections 3, 7 and 10 of the Act:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n[\u2026]\n3.1 For greater certainty, a discriminatory practice includes a practice based on one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination or on the effect of a combination of prohibited grounds.\n[\u2026]\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[\u2026]\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[82] \u201cDisability\u201d is defined in section 25 of the Act:\n\u201cdisability\u201d means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug;\n[83] In its SOP and ASOP, the Respondent refers to the Complainant\u2019s \u201cstress\u201d disability, implying it did not think Dr. Bautista had properly or thoroughly diagnosed the Complainant and that perhaps the Complainant did not have a legitimate disability. In the CMCCs, the Respondent confirmed that it does not believe the Complainant had a disability within the meaning of the Act, and asserts it could not have engaged in any employment practices that were discriminatory based on disability.\n[84] The Tribunal must determine if the Complainant establishes a prima facie case based on the evidence presented. This includes the determination by the Tribunal as to whether the Complainant has a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[85] In Audet v. Canadian National Railway, 2006 CHRT 25, the definition of disability under section 25 of the Act has been interpreted to mean \u201cany physical or mental impairment that results in a functional limitation, or that is associated with the perception of impairment.\u201d In this case, the employer perceived that Mr. Audet\u2019s epilepsy and resulting seizures impaired his ability to function in a safety-critical position. His condition was found to be a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[86] The decision in Desormeaux c. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, 2005 CarswellNat 2005 FCA 311, leave to appeal refused 2006 CarswellNat 621, 2006 CarswellNat 620 (S.C.C.), involved an appeal from the Federal Court of Canada, which quashed a decision of the Tribunal upholding a complaint of discrimination on the grounds of disability. The complaint arose after OC Transpo dismissed Ms. Desormeaux for innocent absenteeism arising from her migraine headaches. The Tribunal found that Ms. Desormeaux\u2019s headaches constituted a disability for the purpose of the Act, and upon judicial review, the Federal Court found the Tribunal\u2019s finding on disability was unreasonable.\n[87] The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and noted that the Tribunal was entitled to considerable deference based on the evidence it had before it related to the complainant\u2019s headaches, and found that the Tribunal could reasonably have found that there was a disability because of the headaches, whether they were migraine headaches, migraine\/tension headaches, or some other type of severe headache condition.\n[88] In Dupuis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FC 511, the Court confirmed that mental illness, in its many forms and varying degrees, or the employer\u2019s perception thereof, is a disability within section 25 of the Act. The Court noted the employee may be unaware that he or she is suffering from a mental illness so it is possible that the employee never sees a doctor or notifies the employer of their need for accommodation. The Court stated that if a manager can detect a change of behaviour that could be attributable to a mental disorder, it is the manager\u2019s responsibility to determine whether accommodation is necessary.\n[89] In Desrosiers v. Canada Post Corp., 2003 CHRT 26, the complainant\u2019s back ailment was found to be a disability within the meaning of the Act. The Tribunal stated at para. 34:\n\u2026..'disability' may be the result of a physical limitation, a perceived limitation, or a combination of the two. [See Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne & des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665 (S.C.C.), para. 79.]. The Tribunal must therefore consider in its determination not only the complainant\u2019s medical condition, but also the circumstances in which a distinction is made. In other words, in the context of the impugned practice of an employer, the Tribunal must determine, inter alia, whether an actual or perceived ailment causes the complainant to experience the loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the life of the community to the same extent as others\u2026\n[90] Based on the above-noted decisions, The determination whether the Complainant in this case suffered from a disability or whether the Respondent perceived him to suffer from a disability, within the meaning of section 25 of the Act, is a finding of fact to be made by the Tribunal based on the witnesses who provide evidence regarding the Complainant\u2019s limitations, if any, and the Respondent\u2019s perception of the Complainant\u2019s limitations, if any.\n[91] The determination as to whether the Complainant had a disability requires a legal analysis within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Tribunal will not delegate the determination of disability to the witnesses. Pursuant to Tribunal decisions in Brooks, Gaucher and PSAC, evidence which purports to usurp the fact finding\/legal analysis function of the Tribunal is inadmissible.\n[92] If the Complainant establishes a prima facie case, the Respondent may be able to establish that its employment practices were based on a bona fide occupational requirement and were therefore not discriminatory as per s. 15 of the Act:\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n[\u2026]\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n[93] The Commission has suggested that the issue of whether the Complainant could safely work is relevant to the Respondent\u2019s defence of bona fide occupational requirement.\n[94] The Respondent acknowledges Dr. Belchetz did not play any advisory or consultant role in the events that led up to and resulted in the Complainant\u2019s termination. There is no apparent relevance of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report to s. 15 and the Respondent has not indicated any relevance to s. 15 in its SOP, ASOP or submissions.\n[95] According to the Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP, and Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report, the Respondent will lead evidence and\/or cross-examine Dr. Bautista in relation to her diagnosis of the Complainant and the basis for his request to work a specified number of hours. Prior to 2010, it was a ceiling of 45 hours a week, and in 2010, a range of 40 to 42 hours.\n[96] The Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP claim the lack of medical assessment and evidence to support Dr. Bautista\u2019s opinion the Complainant required a weekly limit of 40 to 42 hours caused the Respondent concern as to whether the Complainant could safely work at all. The Respondent will lead evidence of its reaction to Dr. Bautista\u2019s notes and reports and its resulting actions, which is relevant to s. 15.\n[97] Based on the Respondent\u2019s SOP and ASOP and its submissions, the purpose of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report appears to be to discredit Dr. Bautista by criticizing her diagnosis of the Complainant, or lack thereof, and\/or to question to basis for Dr. Bautista\u2019s opinion that the Complainant required reduced hours at the material time, and\/or to question whether the Complainant was safe to work at all. The Respondent will cross-examine Dr. Bautista on these points. The Tribunal will exercise its function to assess Dr. Bautista\u2019s reliability and credibility and determine the weight to give to her evidence, in so far as it is relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the issues in this case.\n[98] In his report, Dr. Belchetz agreed with Respondent counsel that Dr. Bautista\u2019s notes and reports caused him concern that the Complainant could not safely perform his job, even with reduced hours. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence is to support, in a self-serving way, the Respondent\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Bautista and other Complainant witnesses and the evidence the Respondent will present. This may be relevant and helpful to the Respondent but it is self-serving evidence advocating for the Respondent under the guise of expert opinion evidence.\n[99] Dr. Batista\u2019s report does not contain scientific or technical information that requires the evidence of an expert to inform the Tribunal. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report is not based on objective assessment or research - his observations could be made by a lay person. The critique of Dr. Bautista can be advanced by the Respondent by the evidence of its witnesses, its cross-examination of the Complainant\u2019s witnesses, and the submissions of its counsel.\n[100] I conclude that the evidence is not relevant or necessary for the Respondent to advance its case and that it is not required by the Tribunal to assess Dr. Bautista\u2019s credibility and reliability. Dr. Bechetz\u2019s report is not necessary for the Tribunal to make inferences and findings of fact to decide the issues in this case. I view the introduction of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s ready-made inferences based on submissions by the Respondent as an attempt to usurp the role of the Tribunal as the trier of fact.\nC. Absence of any Exclusionary Rule\n[101] There is no exclusionary rule. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s report complies with the form required by Rule 6(3).\nD. Properly Qualified Expert\n[102] Respondent counsel characterizes Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence as \u201cexpert peer review\u201d and Dr. Belchetz states he is retained as \u201can objective subject matter expert.\u201d These terms are too broad and vague to be described as \u201careas of expertise.\u201d\n[103] Dr. Belchetz\u2019s curriculum vitae indicates he graduated from medical school in 2000 and completed a residency in family medicine and was certified by the Royal College of Family Physicians of Canada in 2004. Since 2004, he has worked as an Emergency Physician and undertaken additional emergency medicine training in trauma and cardiac life support.\n[104] Dr. Belchetz indicates he is an \u201con air expert\u201d for Global News and CTV\/Bell Media and lists his articles that have been published in newspapers. Dr. Belchetz does not list any research, academic papers or teaching experience in family physician peer review. Dr. Belchetz does not list any training in or experience with family physician peer review.\n[105] I do not view Dr. Belchetz as a properly qualified expert to give the opinion evidence included in his report, mostly because I do not view his opinion as anything more than a ready-made inference of doubt regarding the credibility and reliability of Dr. Bautista\u2019s notes and reports, based on the criticisms of her medical practice. I believe an informed lay person could make the same criticisms and draw the same conclusions, especially if the Respondent suggested the concerns as it did with Dr. Belchetz.\nE. Cost-Benefit Analysis\n[106] After regular case management in 2015 and 2016, in April 2016, the hearing was scheduled for two weeks starting June 6, 2016. On June 2, 2016, the Respondent sought and was granted an adjournment until August 2016. At the CMCC on June 9, 2016, the Respondent advised it retained Dr. Belchetz to critique Dr. Bautista\u2019s reports and medical records disclosed in September 2015. In response, the Complainant requested an adjournment of his case from June 13 to August 2016, which was granted.\n[107] The Respondent has not explained why it requisitioned the report of Dr. Belchetz in such close proximity to the hearing or explained how the report is relevant and necessary to its case. Dr. Belchetz\u2019s new report had the effect of delaying the hearing until at least August 2016 and increased legal costs for all with this interim motion by the Complainant.\n[108] The Respondent submits that pursuant to subsection 50(3)(c), I should allow Dr. Belchetz to give evidence anyway, even if he is not qualified as an expert, and decide what weight, if any, to give his evidence later.\n[109] White Burgess imposes a \u201cgate keeper\u201d function with respect to expert opinion evidence. After the factors of independence and impartiality, relevance, necessity and expert qualifications are considered, the benefits of the evidence, including probative value, compared to the risks of harm to the hearing or prejudice to the other parties is considered. At this stage, Dr. Belchetz\u2019s independence and impartiality are considered again as part of the cost-benefit analysis (para. 34 of White Burgess). Paragraph 18 of White Burgess lists possible risks to the hearing, including delayed hearings, adjournments, increased cost, longer hearings, improper deference to the expert, junk science and battle of the experts.\n[110] I have already identified my concern that Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence is an attempt to usurp the inference and fact finding function of the Tribunal by asking the Tribunal to accept Dr. Belchetz\u2019s criticisms of Dr. Bautista, that in reality, are the Respondent\u2019s criticisms of Dr. Bautista.\n[111] Subsection 48.9(1) requires the hearing proceed as expeditiously as the principles of natural justice will allow. If I allow Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence, the Complainant may require another adjournment. The Complainant may incur more expense to provide responding evidence, possibly from a third doctor, to address the credibility and reliability of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence. This would be a battle of the experts addressing the credibility and reliability of each doctor, which has no apparent relevance to the issues to be determined by the Tribunal.\n[112] In my view, the resulting lengthening, delay and increased cost of the hearing as a result of allowing Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence and allowing the Complainant the opportunity to respond, is an unnecessary risk to the integrity of the hearing process and prejudice to the Complainant, given the limited utility of Dr. Belchetz\u2019s evidence.\nX. Conclusion\n[113] The Complainant\u2019s motion to exclude the report and viva voce evidence of Dr. Brett Belchetz is granted.\nSigned by\nJ.

In this case, the complainant submits that she suffered discrimination based on a prohibited ground (s. 7, Canadian Human Rights Act) as part of her hiring process. She claims that she was refused the position that she applied for on grounds of discrimination based on the fact that her application was apparently refused given her affiliation with the director of the Centre to which she had applied.\n[2] In this case, the respondent submits that the hearing should be held in Sorel-Tracy, close to Odanak, which is where the complaint originated and where most of the witnesses reside.\n[3] The complainant instead argues that the hearing should be held in Montr\u00e9al, where she is currently living. She also claims that she has more limited financial means, which puts her in a more difficult position than the respondent.\n[4] It is the usual practice of the Tribunal to hold hearings in the place where the alleged discrimination occurred. The Tribunal strives to accommodate the parties where it is appropriate to do so (Warman v. Canadian Heritage Alliance and Melissa Guille, 2006 CHRT 17, at paragraph 4).\n[5] The Tribunal may consider the location where the parties involved reside, as well as where the witnesses who will be called upon to testify reside. The Tribunal may also consider the parties\u2019 financial means.\n[6] In this case, the complaint originated in Odanak, which is about 30 minutes from Sorel-Tracy. It is true that the complainant currently lives in Montr\u00e9al, but the witnesses who she will call to testify in her case, and for whom she will have to bear the costs, are all residents of the Odanak region.\n[7] The respondent\u2019s representatives as well as the witnesses that the respondent wishes to call are all residents of Odanak.\n[8] The distance between Montr\u00e9al and Sorel-Tracy is approximately 92 km, that is, about one hour. The distance separating the Odanak reserve and Sorel-Tracy is 31 km, that is, about 30 minutes.\n[9] Given that the complaint originated in the Odanak region, that the vast majority of the witnesses are residents of that region, including the witnesses for the complainant, and also given that everyone will need to travel to Sorel-Tracy, I find that there would be more inconvenience, including costs for the complainant, if the hearing were held in Montr\u00e9al instead of Sorel-Tracy.\n[10] Therefore, I direct that the hearing into this complaint be conducted in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, in a place where it will be possible to hold the hearing as arranged by the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 2, 2016\n",

Update to remedial order\n[1] This Panel continues to supervise Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada\u2019s (INAC\u2019s) implementation and actions in response to findings that First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are denied equal child and family services, and\/or are differentiated adversely in the provision of child and family services, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA) [see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 2 (the Decision)].\n[2] Generally, INAC was ordered to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the First Nations Child and Family Services (FNCFS) Program and the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians applicable in Ontario (the 1965 Agreement) to reflect the Panel\u2019s findings in the Decision. INAC was also ordered to cease applying a narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of the principle. The order and findings in the Decision are the main reference points from which the Panel bases any further orders.\n[3] Following up on the general order in the Decision, in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 10, the Panel reiterated and emphasized certain findings and adverse impacts from the Decision and ordered INAC to take measures to address those findings and adverse impacts immediately. To assist the Panel in assessing the implementation of the Decision and subsequent order, INAC was directed to provide a comprehensive report indicating how the findings in the Decision were being addressed to provide immediate relief for First Nations children.\n[4] In response to INAC\u2019s reporting requirements and following further submissions from the parties thereon, this ruling updates the Panel\u2019s order in addressing the findings of the Decision in the short term. Other short, mid and long-term reforms of the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement, along with other requests for compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA, will be dealt with at a later point.\n[5] In general, the Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (the Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN), along with the Commission and the Interested Parties participating at this stage of the proceedings, the Chiefs of Ontario (the COO) and the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (the NAN), are in agreement about the orders requested of the Panel to address the findings of the Decision in the short-term. Their submissions and requested orders are collectively referred to as those of the \u2018Complainants, Commission and Interested Parties\u2019 or \u2018CCI Parties\u2019 in this ruling. Where the submissions of the Complainants, Commission or Interested Parties may differ, those submissions are specifically outlined.\nII. Preliminary remarks\n[6] The Panel thanks the parties and interested parties for their most recent submissions. It has carefully considered them and found them to be very helpful. The Panel recognizes the time, effort and resources dedicated by the parties to complete them. Generally, the Panel is supportive of the majority of the orders requested made by the CCI Parties.\n[7] The Panel is pleased to learn that the federal government has accepted to do a number of important things in response to the Decision and has made some progress in implementing the findings and orders from the Decision. Overall, the Panel believes the federal government is working towards reforming its approach to First Nations child and family services and implementing meaningful change for First Nations children and families.\n[8] That said, and as addressed in this ruling, more progress still needs to be made in the immediate and long-term to ensure the discrimination identified in the Decision is remedied. In this regard, as emphasized in its last ruling (2016 CHRT 10), the Panel believes the dissemination of relevant and timely information continues to be of the utmost importance in rebuilding trust between the parties and avoiding conflicts and delays going forward.\n[9] Generally, the Panel fails to understand why much of the information provided in INAC\u2019s most recent submissions could not have been delivered earlier, especially if this information formed part of the rationale for determining the budget for the FNCFS Program back in March 2016. INAC ought to have known this information was and remains important in responding to the Panel\u2019s information requests and reporting orders. Indeed, the Panel and the CCI Parties have been requesting this type of information for months now. It rests on INAC and the federal government to implement the Panel\u2019s findings and orders, and to clearly communicate how it is doing so, including providing a rationale for their actions and any supporting data and\/or documentation, ensures the Panel and the parties that this is indeed the case.\n[10] INAC has also recognized the CCI Parties as partners in the reform process and identified a need to consult Indigenous peoples across Canada to obtain their input on reforms. While this is necessary and consistent with the federal government\u2019s duty to consult Indigenous peoples, again, improved communication surrounding such endeavours would greatly assist the Panel in understanding INAC\u2019s strategy to address the Decision and would help build the trust necessary to establish a partnership between the parties. It is also unclear if or who has been consulted among the Indigenous community at this point, including if any social workers or other experts in the field of child welfare have been consulted. On this last point, INAC has previously acknowledged that it does not have expertise in the provision of child and family services to First Nations. Therefore, the need to consult with experts in the field, including the Caring Society, should be a priority.\n[11] Likewise, the Panel has made a number of comments since the Decision on the importance of the parties meeting to discuss reform of the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement in the immediate and long term. In this regard, the Panel notes the Caring Society, the AFN and INAC did not even acknowledge until their most recent submissions that they had met several times to discuss reforms and the reestablishment of the National Advisory Committee (the NAC). This is important information because the ability of the parties to work together at this immediate relief stage is a good way to test if the reinstatement of the NAC will yield success in reforming the provision of First Nations child and family services in the long term. INAC needs to improve its communication and information sharing with the other parties and the Panel, while continuing to build the partnership it has acknowledged. In addition, the Panel requests that it be kept informed of any relevant memorandums of understanding and\/or agreements reached between the parties and\/or important meetings discussing the subject matter of this case.\n[12] As always, the Panel continues to encourage the parties to communicate effectively and work together. It also remains willing to assist the parties in reaching that goal. While the Panel is committed to eradicating discrimination and seeing the provision of First Nations child and family services reformed, and will continue to supervise the implementation of its orders in this regard; it also steadfastly believes that collaboration amongst the parties outside the four walls of the Tribunal is the best way to ensure reconciliation and effective reforms now and into the future. All parties are clearly dedicated to reconciliation and should continue to attempt to work together towards that goal.\n[13] That said, the Panel will make further orders if need be to ensure discrimination is eliminated. In this vein, the Panel will rule on some immediate relief measures in this ruling and will leave others to be discussed at a future in-person case management meeting. The Panel appreciates that some parties wish this remedial process would proceed more quickly. While the Panel shares this sentiment, remedying the discrimination found in the Decision is a complex matter and depends greatly on the way in which information is provided to the Panel. In fact, some CCI Parties have cautioned the Panel to be careful in how it crafts its orders in terms of adequacy and impacts. Consequently, the Panel wishes to ensure all parties have a full and ample opportunity to present their points of view and that it has all necessary information to make informed orders. Nonetheless, the Panel hopes to see change materialize at the earliest opportunity. It believes some of that change can happen immediately while INAC\u2019s First Nations child welfare system is being reformed through consultations with Indigenous peoples and the parties involved in this case. The Panel makes the following ruling in this regard.\nIII. The FNCFS Program\n[14] INAC\u2019s report in response to the Panel\u2019s ruling in 2016 CHRT 10 provided some information on how it is immediately dealing with the shortcomings of the FNCFS Program identified in the Decision. INAC submits that it is addressing these shortcomings through new financial investments in the FNCFS Program, along with modifications to its existing funding formulas, until a full reform of the FNCFS Program can be completed. Hence, INAC is of the view that many of the immediate relief measures proposed by the CCI Parties need to be addressed as part of mid to long-term reform of the FNCFS Program, after thorough engagement with key partners.\n[15] In its most recent report, INAC outlines the new financial investments in the FNCFS Program allocated by the federal government in Budget 2016 over the next five years, along with the budget allocation of each FNCFS agency for this fiscal year and the funding models used to generate those budgets.\n[16] Generally, the CCI Parties submit that INAC has not shown whether or how new investments in the FNCFS Program will be sufficient to address the findings in the Decision, especially in the short term.\n[17] For the reasons that follow, the Panel is of the view that further orders, including additional information and reporting by INAC, are required to ensure the findings in the Decision with respect to the FNCFS Program have been or will be addressed in the short term.\nA. Adjustments to funding formula assumptions and flaws\n[18] One of the main findings in the Decision is that INAC\u2019s FNCFS Program, which flows funding through formulas, Directive 20-1 and the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach (EPFA), provides funding based on flawed assumptions about the number of children in care, the number of families in need of services, and population levels that do not accurately reflect the real service needs of many on-reserve communities. This results in inadequate fixed funding for operation costs (capital costs, multiple offices, cost of living adjustment, staff salaries and benefits, training, legal, remoteness and travel) and prevention costs (primary, secondary and tertiary services to maintain children safely in their family homes), hindering the ability of FNCFS Agencies to provide provincially\/territorially mandated child welfare services, let alone culturally appropriate services. Most importantly, inadequate funding for operation and prevention costs provides an incentive to bring children into care because eligible maintenance expenditures to maintain a child in care are reimbursable at cost (see the Decision at paras. 384-389 and 458).\n[19] In 2016 CHRT 10, the Panel ordered INAC to immediately take measures to address the assumptions and flaws in its funding formulas, including all the underlined items at paragraphs 20 and 23 of that ruling. INAC was to provide a comprehensive report explaining how those flaws and assumptions are being addressed in the short term to provide immediate relief to First Nations on reserve. The Panel\u2019s order also required INAC to provide detailed information on budget allocations for each FNCFS Agency and timelines for when those allocations will be rolled-out, including detailed calculations of the amounts received by each agency in 2015-2016; the data relied upon to make those calculations; and, the amounts each has or will receive in 2016-2017, along with a detailed calculation of any adjustments made as a result of immediate action taken to address the findings in the Decision (see 2016 CHRT 10 at paras. 20-25).\n[20] Since 2016 CHRT 10, INAC submits Canada's immediate relief investments will address and help to remediate the discrimination identified by the Tribunal and will improve outcomes for First Nations children and families. The investments will provide greater prevention services to families and support critically needed FNCFS Program stability, while ensuring that no disruption of services occurs during work to reform the FNCFS Program.\n[21] Through increased investment in the FNCFS Program, INAC submits it is eliminating the use of Directive 20-1. Where Directive 20-1 applies, FNCFS Agencies will be provided funding through existing mechanisms this fiscal year, but with increased funding levels determined using the more updated EPFA costing model. In 2016-17, INAC is investing $17.5 million for prevention services and programs as immediate relief for FNCFS Agencies still under the Directive 20-1 regime.\n[22] For jurisdictions under the EPFA funding model, INAC indicates that updates include: additional funding to address population increases; allowing upward adjustments to be made for 26 agencies with more than 6% of children in care; adjustments to staff salaries to ensure comparability with provincial rates; updates to reflect changes in provincial standards (e.g. caseload ratios for social workers or other front line workers) and to support intake and investigation services; updates to service delivery standards, such as increasing the percentage used to calculate off-hour emergency services and increased funding for staff travel; increased funding for agency audit, insurance and legal services; and, increased amounts for the service purchase per child (i.e. service providers will receive $175 per 0-18 child served, regardless of jurisdiction).\n[23] INAC submits that Budget 2016 amounts to address the flaws in Directive 20-1 and the EPFA are higher than what was identified by INAC in its 2012 Way Forward Presentation (see the Decision at paras. 295-298). Over five years, the Way Forward Presentation estimated $108 million to, among other things, expand the EPFA to the jurisdictions still under Directive 20-1, while topping-up existing EPFA jurisdictions. While the CCI Parties focus on Budget 2016\u2019s year 1 investment in stating that new funding falls short of the estimated five-year totals in the Way Forward Presentation, INAC submits the proper comparison is Budget 2016\u2019s year 5 investments. That is, Budget 2016 proposes $176.8 million in year 5 to, among other things, expand prevention based services in Directive 20-1 jurisdictions and top-up jurisdictions operating under the EPFA.\n[24] With regard to small FNCFS Agencies, INAC indicates that agencies with less than 800 children in care will still be subject to scaling with respect to their core funding (expenses for Board of Directors, employee salaries, benefits, training and travel, funding for agency evaluations, audits, insurance, legal fees and administrative overhead). However, this does not decrease the funding provided to an agency for protection or prevention services. According to INAC, future approaches to funding small agencies will be part of longer term engagement with First Nations and provincial partners.\n[25] The CCI Parties submit that the true measure of the impact of INAC\u2019s immediate relief measures is the extent to which the incentive to remove First Nations children from their homes has been reduced. They contend that INAC\u2019s compliance report is bereft of assurances that the incentives to bring children into care identified in the Decision will be reduced by its immediate relief investments and changes to its funding formulas; they also submit that INAC has not shown that additional program investments will allow FNCFS Agencies to provide services on par with those provided by the provinces.\n[26] While upwards adjustments are being made for agencies serving more than 6% of children in care, the CCI Parties are unclear about the extent to which the actual percentage of children in care is being funded. Furthermore, there appears to be no upwards adjustments for agencies serving more than 20% of families in need. For small agencies, the CCI Parties submit that INAC was not given the option of deferring the problems caused by scaling core funding based on population levels.\n[27] The CCI Parties request an order that INAC immediately make adjustments to its funding formulas to ensure operations budgets for FNCFS Agencies approximate actual costs. They suggest various modifications to INAC\u2019s funding formulas, including:\n\u00b7 increases to the base amounts in the formula, including for the child purchase amount;\n\u00b7 that FNCFS Agencies, serving a population where the percentage of children in care and percentage of families receiving services exceeds 6% and 20% respectively, be provided with an upward adjustment for their operations and prevention budgets in proportion to the excess percentages;\n\u00b7 that no downwards adjustments be applied to FNCFS Agencies with fewer than 6% of children in care and\/or serving fewer than 20% of families;\n\u00b7 that adjustments to the fixed amount in the funding formula for population levels be increased; and\n\u00b7 that the fixed amount in the funding formula for all FNCFS Agencies serving fewer than 251 Registered Indian children be the same amount provided to agencies serving at least 251 Registered Indian children.\n[28] The Panel recognizes the efforts made so far by INAC and its desire to improve the lives of First Nations children through negotiations with key partners. The Panel also finds INAC`s explanation outlined in paragraph 23 above to be reasonable in terms of the amount of funding being higher than the amount in the 2012 Way Forward Presentation. Aside from the overall amount of additional funding being invested in the FNCFS Program, the Panel was pleased to learn that new funding (approximately $28.4 million) was actually provided to FNCFS Agencies on July 1st, 2016, with other additional funds coming before the end of this fiscal year, in part to address some of the flawed assumptions in INAC\u2019s funding formulas.\n[29] However, as stated in the Decision at paragraph 482, \u201c[m]ore than just funding, there is a need to refocus the policy of the program to respect human rights principles and sound social work practice.\u201d The Panel is concerned to read in INAC`s submissions much of the same type of statements and reasoning that it has seen from the organization in the past. For example, that it is up to each FNCFS Agency to determine how they allocate their funding for such things as prevention and cultural programing (see Decision at paras. 187-189, 311, 313 and 314). This prompts the same question as at the time of the hearing: what if funding is not sufficient to allow for that flexibility? How has INAC determined that each agency has sufficient funding to comply with provincial child welfare standards and is still able to deliver necessary prevention and cultural services? The fact that key items, such as determining funding for remote and small agencies, were deferred to later is reflective of INAC\u2019s old mindset that spurred this complaint. This may imply that INAC is still informed by information and policies that fall within this old mindset and that led to discrimination. Indeed, the Panel identified the challenges faced by small and\/or remote agencies and communities across Canada, numerous times in the Decision (see for example paras. 153, 277, 284, 287, 291, 313 and 314). INAC has studied and been aware of these issues for quite some time and, yet, has still not shown it has developed a strategy to address them.\n[30] The emphasis on discussions with key partners at tripartite tables is also something this Panel has seen in the evidence and heard from INAC many times throughout these proceedings (see Decision at paras. 138, 139, 191-197, 201 and 213-215). One main example of this in the evidence is the situations in Quebec and British Columbia. Despite many consultations, discussions and joint studies in the past, and even with ready and willing partners prepared to transition those provinces from Directive 20-1 to the EPFA, that transition has yet to occur or was significantly delayed (see Decision at paras. 73-77 and 314).\n[31] While the Panel understands meaningful long-term reform and change will be accomplished in consultation with key partners, such as Indigenous peoples across Canada and the provinces, the purpose of immediate relief has been and still is to eliminate as many adverse impacts as possible at this time with the information that we have, the findings in the Decision and with the assistance of experts, FNCFS Agencies and the parties. Immediate relief is a temporary measure to remove as many adverse impacts as possible with the understanding that consultation, studies and data collection will translate into a more comprehensive and effective change of the FNCFS Program.\n[32] Comprehensive reform will take some time. The Panel understands this and believes a complete reform will happen. However, immediate relief should be treated as such and not transformed into a long term remedy. While additional funding may address the most discriminatory aspects of INAC\u2019s funding formulas in the short term, the Panel is not currently in a position to determine if this is the case. The Panel acknowledges and appreciates much of the additional information INAC provided in response to its ruling in 2016 CHRT 10; however, even with this additional information, the rationale and\/or methodology for allocating the additional funding is not fully explained and the supporting data and\/or documentation, including the cost driver study and trend analysis on which INAC claims Budget 2016 investments in the FNCFS Program were developed is incomplete.\n[33] That is, the Panel analyzing is not concerned with the specific amount of funding per se, but rather the way in which it is determined. It is the way in which the FNCFS Program is delivered and funding is determined that results in discriminatory effects for First Nations children and families. The Panel\u2019s focus is on whether funding is being determined based on an evaluation of the distinct needs and circumstances of First Nations children and families and their communities. While other key factors come into play in determining whether the amount of funding provided to FNCFS Agencies is adequate to address the needs of the communities they serve, such as remoteness and the extent of travel to meet children and families (which will be addressed later in this ruling), the assumptions about the number of children in care, the number of families in need of services and population levels are the starting point for addressing the discriminatory impacts of INAC\u2019s funding formulas.\n[34] Therefore, leaving some of the assumptions and flaws in the funding formulas for long term reform to ensure everyone is consulted may be problematic. As said in the Decision, a piecemeal approach to reform is not an effective way to proceed (see Decision at paras. 185 and 331). While the Panel understands that INAC is determined to reform the entire FNCFS Program and believes it intends do so, it is concerned that deferring immediate action in favour of consultation and reform at a later date will perpetuate the discrimination the FNCFS Program has fostered for the past 15 years. Over that time, despite well documented problems with the program and consultations with its partners and at tripartite tables, INAC\u2019s system has failed to adapt to the needs of First Nations children and families (for example, see Decision at paras.134,138-141, 203, 311, 314-315, 383-394 and 456-467). The Panel understands this is no easy task and that the FNCFS Program cannot be reformed in an instant. However, this does not mean that effective measures cannot be implemented in the meantime. The Panel also agrees with the parties that a one-size-fits-all type of approach is not to be used; this was also addressed in the Decision (see para. 315).\n[35] Throughout the Decision, the Panel highlighted the dichotomy between the objectives of the FNCFS Program and INAC\u2019s flawed methods for achieving those objectives (see for example para. 312). Many of those flaws can be corrected at this time, without the need for additional large scale consultation and study. Again, the purpose is to eliminate as many adverse impacts as possible while the system is being reviewed and reformed. Indeed, as indicated by the CCI Parties, INAC was not given the option to defer addressing the assumptions and flaws in its funding formulas to address them solely in the long term. As the service provider, funder and FNCFS Program manager, INAC was given some flexibility in the manner in which to address the findings in the Decision. However, in 2016 CHRT 10, the Panel was clear that the immediate measures underlined and identified in that ruling had to be undertaken now while further long-term reform was being contemplated.\n[36] The Panel reiterates its immediate relief orders that all items identified in paragraph 20 of 2016 CHRT 10, and not limited to the items that were underlined, must be remedied immediately, including the adverse effects related to:\n\u00b7 The assumptions about children in care, families in need of services and population levels;\n\u00b7 Remote and\/or small agencies;\n\u00b7 Inflation\/cost of living and for changing service standards; and\n\u00b7 Salaries and benefits, training, legal costs, insurance premiums, travel, multiple offices, capital infrastructure, culturally appropriate programs and services, and least disruptive measures.\n[37] With specific regard to remote agencies, the Panel expects INAC to develop a strategy that takes into account such things as the additional costs associated with travel distances between service centers in terms of similarity to provincial statutory response times and managing impacts on service providers and the children and families they serve; the availability of surrounding services or lack thereof; and, the higher costs and cost of living in northern and\/or isolated areas. Remoteness can affect each item in a FNCFS Agency\u2019s budget. The Panel will return to the issue of remoteness below.\n[38] Again, the objectives of the FNCFS Program can only be met if INAC\u2019s funding methodology is focused on service levels and the real needs of First Nations children and families, which may vary from one child, family or Nation to another. A focus on the overall amount of funding, through the continued application of flawed funding formulas, does little, if anything, to correct the discrimination found in the Decision. Therefore, the Panel orders INAC to immediately establish the funding assumptions of 6% of children in care and 20% of families in need of services as minimum standards only. INAC has indicated that, even where the number of children in care is below 6%, it will not reduce the amount of funding to such agencies. INAC is ordered to apply the same standard for the assumption of 20% of families in need of services. That is, it will not reduce the amount of funding for FNCFS Agencies that serve less than 20% of families in need of services.\n[39] For agencies that have more than 6% of children in care and\/or that serve more than 20% of families, INAC is ordered to determine funding for those agencies based on an assessment of the actual levels of children in care and families in need of services. While INAC has indicated that it is allowing upward adjustments to be made for 26 FNCFS Agencies with more than 6% of children in care, there is insufficient information that those upward adjustments are based on an assessment of the actual levels of children in care. Furthermore, INAC has not indicated how it is addressing agencies serving more than 20% of families. As indicated below in its order at the end of this ruling, INAC will be required to report back to the Tribunal confirming that it has implemented this order and clearly demonstrate how it has done so. Again, this order is only meant to provide short-term relief given that a full reform of the FNCFS Program will occur in the long term following further consultation with Indigenous peoples, partners and experts from across Canada.\n[40] For the assumptions in the funding formulas based on population levels, INAC is ordered to immediately stop formulaically reducing funding based on arbitrary population thresholds. Again, funding must be provided based on an assessment of the actual service level needs of FNCFS Agencies. As above, INAC will be required to report back to the Tribunal confirming that it has implemented this order and clearly demonstrate how it has done so.\n[41] Relatedly, and as addressed in more detail below, the Panel needs more information on how INAC determined its five-year plan for investing in the FNCFS Program and in determining budgets for each FNCFS Agency. The Panel notes that there are already some costing model template documents filed in evidence with the Tribunal and in INAC\u2019s most recent submissions which provide some of this additional information. However, this information still needs to be further detailed to clearly explain how the children\u2019s and families\u2019 needs are being addressed in response to the Panel\u2019s findings and orders.\n[42] Furthermore, given INAC\u2019s emphasis on consultation in response to many of the items in this ruling, it would be helpful to the Panel and the other parties if INAC could provide a list of the First Nations, FNCFS Agencies, provincial and territorial authorities, partners, experts or any other persons it has consulted with so far in response to the findings in the Decision, along with its consultation plan moving forward. The list of any past consultations from January to September 2016 should include the agenda and summary of the discussions.\nB. Funding for legal fees, capital infrastructure, culturally appropriate services, child service purchase amount and the receipt, assessment and investigation of child protection reports\n[43] According to INAC, the issue of funding legal fees, capital infrastructure and culturally appropriate programs and services will be addressed as part of future reform discussions. Addressing some of these issues may require engagement and discussion with First Nations, FNCFS Agencies and provincial\/territorial governments. According to INAC, unilateral action in addressing these important issues would be contrary to the federal government's commitment to renew the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. INAC adds that immediate relief investments could be utilized by FNCFS Agencies to respond to individual community needs for culturally based programming and activities.\n[44] With respect to the child service purchase amount, INAC indicates that it has increased it from $100 to $175 per child. On the receipt, assessment and investigation of child protection reports, INAC submits that Budget 2016 investments will provide approximately $45 million over the next five years in additional funding to support intake and investigation services, which include activities such as the receipt, assessment and investigation of child reports.\n[45] For their part, the CCI Parties do not understand why the issue of funding legal fees, capital infrastructure and culturally appropriate programs and services cannot be addressed at this stage. There are actions that can be taken now to alleviate discrimination that fall entirely within federal jurisdiction and do not depend on corresponding provincial action, including simply adopting and adequately funding applicable provincial\/territorial standards regarding these issues. Specifically, the CCI Parties request:\n\u00b7 Each FNCFS Agency be provided $75,000 in fiscal year 2016\/2017 to develop and\/or update a culturally based vision for safe and healthy children and families, and to begin to develop and\/or update culturally based child and family service standards, programs and evaluation mechanisms;\n\u00b7 Legal fees related to children in care, and child welfare investigations and inquiries, be fully reimbursable according to the tariff employed by the federal government for the remuneration of outside counsel; and\n\u00b7 The costs of building repairs, where a FNCFS Agency has received a notice to the effect that repairs must be done to comply with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations, or where there is other evidence of non-compliance with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations, be fully reimbursable.\n[46] For the child service purchase amount, the CCI Parties request that it be increased to $200 per child. For costs related to the receipt, assessment and investigation of child protection reports, the CCI Parties submit that they should be fully reimbursable.\n[47] As stated above in the previous section of this ruling, the Panel is not concerned with the specific amount of funding per se, but with the way in which it is determined: that it is based on an evaluation of the distinct needs and circumstances of each individual FNCFS Agency. Pursuant to this reasoning, the Panel has insufficient information at this time to make an order with respect to the request for a specific amount of funding for the development and\/or update of culturally based child and family service standards, programs and evaluation mechanisms. The Panel recognizes that leaving it to FNCFS Agencies to use immediate relief investments to address this item does not ensure this need is met, especially in the case of a small agency and\/or remote community. However, the Panel will address this request at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[48] For legal fees, as indicated in 2016 CHRT 10 and reiterated at paragraph 36 above, the Panel expects INAC to address this issue as part of immediate relief measures while a longer-term solution is being developed. While the Panel understands the benefit of having discussions on funding for legal fees in the long term, this issue should also be addressed immediately. The Panel orders INAC to provide detailed information in its compliance report to clearly demonstrate how it is addressing this issue. This will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[49] On the issue of building repairs, the Panel fails to understand why INAC cannot address it now, especially where a FNCFS Agency has received a notice to the effect that repairs must be done to comply with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations, or where there is other evidence of non-compliance with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations. Again, while the Panel understands the benefit of having discussions on capital infrastructure in the long term, this urgent issue should also be addressed immediately. The Panel orders INAC to provide detailed information in its compliance report to clearly demonstrate how it is addressing this issue. This will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[50] Finally, with regard to the issues of the child service purchase amount and the costs related to the receipt, assessment and investigation of child protection reports, again, the Panel requires further information on how INAC\u2019s funding allotment for this item meets the needs of individual FNCFS Agencies. The Panel orders INAC to provide detailed information in its compliance report to clearly demonstrate how it determined funding for such costs. This will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nC. Adjustments for inflation\n[51] Another significant finding in the Decision was INAC\u2019s failure to adjust Directive 20-1 funding levels since 1995, along with funding levels under the EPFA, since its implementation, to account for inflation\/cost of living.\n[52] INAC indicates that the investments in Budget 2016 include an annual adjustment to address future cost drivers and growth. The cost drivers that account for average yearly growth include: maintenance growth, agency operating costs (e.g. rent, transportation, supplies and equipment), salaries and increases in ratios of children in care. According to INAC, the annual amount for growth and cost drivers was calculated at approximately 3% of program investments and it is providing $159 million in additional funding over the next five years to address these issues.\n[53] The CCI Parties submit that INAC has failed to detail how much it is allocating for each \u201cgrowth and future cost driver\u201d and does not clearly detail how it arrived at corresponding allocations. Moreover, not all of the future cost drivers identified are linked to inflation. Indeed, the CCI Parties submit some of these cost drivers are linked to the FNCFS Program\u2019s legacy of discrimination (for instance, child maintenance costs). Additionally, they argue the annual adjustment for growth and future cost drivers does nothing to address the systemic disadvantage perpetuated by a lack of inflation adjustments over the last two decades.\n[54] The CCI Parties request increased funding to restore lost purchasing power related to the failure to provide a compounded annual inflation adjustment pursuant to the Consumer Price Index. For fiscal years 2016-17 and forward, they request annual adjustments in funding for FNCFS Agencies according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index.\n[55] INAC is ordered to detail how much it is allocating for each \u201cgrowth and future cost driver\u201d and to detail how it arrived at its corresponding allocations. Given the Panel has questions for INAC, the request for increased funding to restore lost purchasing power will be addressed during the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nD. Cost overruns and the reallocation of funds from other INAC programs\n[56] The Decision also addressed evidence that where there were cost overruns for maintenance expenses, and before providing any additional funding, INAC required FNCFS Agencies to recover those overruns from their prevention or operations funding streams first. Relatedly, in the event maintenance costs exceeded the FNCFS Program budget, funds were reallocated from other INAC programs, such as housing and infrastructure, to meet those maintenance costs. This was described by the Auditor General of Canada as being unsustainable and as also negatively impacting other important social programs for First Nations on reserve.\n[57] Again, INAC submits that Budget 2016 investments took into account cost drivers and growth considerations, including those impacting maintenance expenditures. If pressures exceed the allocated budget, additional resources can be secured. Funds will be allocated to agencies on an as-needed basis to respond to increases in maintenance expenses, provincial salary changes and any increases to the ratio of children in care.\n[58] Furthermore, INAC submits that Budget 2016 investments will contribute to a more stable and predictable funding environment within INAC, thus reducing the need for reallocations from other critical programs such as infrastructure and housing. However, INAC notes that any commitment relating to funding for programs other than the FNCFS Program is beyond the scope of this complaint.\n[59] The CCI Parties submit that only $51,830,765.38 will be conferred to FNCFS Agencies to cover cost overruns in 2016-17. Therefore, they request that INAC be ordered to cease the practice of requiring FNCFS Agencies to recover cost overruns related to maintenance from their prevention and operations funding streams. Moreover, the CCI Parties request an order that INAC cease its practice of reallocating funding from other First Nations programs to address shortfalls in the FNCFS Program.\n[60] The Panel orders INAC to cease the practice of requiring FNCFS Agencies to recover cost overruns related to maintenance from their prevention and operations funding streams. Again, this ensures FNCFS budgets are in a better position to meet the actual needs of the children and families they serve.\n[61] While the reallocation of funding from other First Nations programs to address shortfalls in the FNCFS Program may be outside the four corners of this complaint, the Panel made findings about the adverse impacts of this practice in the Decision (see for example paras. 373 and 390). Therefore, the Panel urges INAC to eliminate this practice.\nE. Additional information requests\n[62] The CCI Parties request further detail on the budget allocations for the FNCFS Program and FNCFS Agencies. Specifically, they note that INAC\u2019s compliance report states that much of the additional funding will be provided \u201cat full implementation\u201d and \u201cover the next five years.\u201d In the CCI Parties\u2019 view, INAC has not provided an explanation as to why there is a five-year delay in taking action and requests INAC be ordered to cease its incremental approach to remedying discrimination. The CCI Parties are also unclear as to when exactly \u201cfull implementation\u201d will be reached or when \u201cover the next five years\u201d many of INAC\u2019s proposed measures will come into effect.\n[63] Furthermore, while INAC has provided the funding models that generated its budgets, the CCI Parties also request that it provide the raw data relied upon to calculate any funding increases, including how it arrived at financial projections beyond fiscal year 2016-2017, any steps taken to ensure comparability of staff salaries and benefit packages to provincial rates, the information used to determine the caseload ratios in Quebec and Manitoba, and, generally, how it determined values for off-hour emergency services, staff travel, agency audits, insurance and legal services.\n[64] According to INAC, \u2018full implementation\u2019 of Budget 2016 will be reached in Year 4 and again in Year 5 of its five-year plan. The financial projections for 2017-18 to 2020-21 were calculated by scaling the full annual investment of Years 4 and 5. Funding will be provided to agencies incrementally because, according to INAC, past experience and discussions with funding recipients have shown that incremental funding allows agencies enough time to hire, train and retain staff, based on the availability of qualified social workers and other staff, and to expand their prevention programming. INAC submits that this approach in no way means that Canada presumes that agencies lack the capacity to implement immediate relief measures, but recognizes that it takes time to grow any organization and this is a mechanism to ensure funding does not lapse.\n[65] INAC adds that the revised funding formulas used to support Budget 2016 investments were updated through a process undertaken over several years, and which include a comprehensive cost driver study and trend analysis based on the most current data available by jurisdiction. With specific regard to staff benefit packages, INAC states that the amount was calculated based on 20.45% of total salaries. This was the methodology agreed upon when EPFA was established. As part of longer-term reform to the FNCFS Program, INAC is open to further discussions with respect to changing the way in which future staff benefits allocations are calculated.\n[66] Much of the information in INAC\u2019s most recent submissions, including information on its methods for determining the amount of new funding and the rationale for rolling it out incrementally, should have been provided months ago, especially given that INAC submits its cost study and trend analysis has been developed over several years. This information would have been helpful in moving forward with immediate relief measures more expeditiously. While the incremental funding approach may be following the past EPFA roll-out, the Panel requests the information above from INAC rather than be left with hypotheses. INAC is directed to disclose to the Panel and the CCI Parties, its cost study and trend analysis documentation on which it based its calculations for allocating Budget 2016 funding. . Furthermore, INAC is ordered to provide its rationale, data and any other relevant information in order to assist this Panel in understanding INAC\u2019s Budget 2016 investments and how they address the findings in the Decision, including how it arrived at financial projections beyond fiscal year 2016-2017; any steps taken to ensure comparability of staff salaries and benefit packages to provincial rates; the information used to determine the caseload ratios in Quebec and Manitoba; and, generally, how it determined values for off-hour emergency services, staff travel, agency audits, insurance, and legal services.\nIV. The 1965 Agreement in Ontario\n[67] With respect to the 1965 Agreement in Ontario, the Decision found that, while it was seemingly an improvement on Directive 20-1 and more advantageous than the EPFA, the application of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario also results in denials of services and adverse effects for First Nations children and families. The Agreement has not been updated for quite some time and does not account for changes made over the years to the Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act for such things as mental health and other prevention services. This is further compounded by a lack of coordination amongst federal programs in dealing with health and social services that affect children and families in need, despite those types of programs being synchronized under the Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act. The Decision also found that the lack of surrounding services to support the delivery of child and family services on-reserve, especially in remote and isolated communities, exacerbates the gap further. Finally, the Decision indicated there is discordance between Ontario\u2019s legislation and standards for providing culturally appropriate services to First Nations children and families, for example, through the appointment of a Band Representative and INAC\u2019s lack of funding thereof (see Decisions at paras. 223-246).\n[68] Again, for the reasons that follow, the Panel is of the view that further orders, including additional information and reporting by INAC, are required to ensure the findings in the Decision with respect to the 1965 Agreement have been or will be addressed in the short term.\nA. Updating the 1965 Agreement\n[69] The CCI Parties request that the schedules of the 1965 Agreement be updated to reflect the current version of Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act. They also ask for an order ensuring funding for the full range of statutory services, including Band Representatives and children\u2019s mental health services, provided by the Ontario\u2019s child welfare legislation.\n[70] On this issue, INAC has indicated that it will actively work with the province of Ontario and stakeholders, such as First Nations organizations, leadership, communities, agencies and front-line service providers, to achieve necessary reforms to the 1965 Agreement. A meeting was held between officials at INAC and the Ontario Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs to discuss issues, including child welfare in Ontario. Subsequently, on March 11, 2016, the Minister of INAC met with the Ontario Minister of Aboriginal Affairs to discuss key priority areas, including FNCFS in Ontario and the need to review the 1965 Agreement. According to Canada, these meetings have set the stage for further and more substantive discussions that will take place with First Nations, including the COO and other Interested Parties.\n[71] Furthermore, on May 10, 2016, INAC's Ontario regional office sent a letter to Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day and provincial Deputy Minister Deborah Richardson, advising them of immediate relief investments coming to Ontario for child and family services. This letter states that funding for Band Representatives will be considered as part of the FNCFS Program reform process.\n[72] In terms of mental health services, INAC submits that $69 million will be invested over the next three years to provide immediate support for Indigenous mental wellness across Canada. This funding is in addition to the close to $300 million provided annually for community-based mental health and addictions programming on-reserve and in the territories. According to INAC, this new funding will support various measures, including some that are specific to Ontario.\n[73] The Panel is pleased to learn about the significant new investments mentioned above. While it may address some of the adverse impacts highlighted in the Decision, again, the Panel is not in a position to assess the extent that it does so whether in the short or longer-term. INAC is ordered to provide its rationale, data and other relevant information to assist this Panel in understanding INAC\u2019s Budget 2016 investments and how they are responsive to the needs of the First Nations children and how it addresses the findings in the Decision, in the short term, especially in terms of mental health services and Band Representatives.\n[74] In this regard, the Panel is aware that, as opposed to provincial service delivery and the Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act, federal health and social services to First Nations children are delivered through different departments. Nevertheless, the Panel made findings with the evidence before it in relation to the gaps and adverse impacts caused by the Federal government\u2019s involvement in health and social services to First Nations children in Ontario (for example, see the Decision at paras. 364-373 and 391-392). Overall, the Panel found the situation in Ontario fell short of the objective of the 1965 Agreement \u201c\u2026to make available to the Indians in the Province the full range of provincial welfare programs\u201d (see Decision at para. 246). Again, the Panel wants to know how those findings are being addressed in the short term while the Agreement is being reformed.\nB. Remoteness Quotient\n[75] The NAN submits that a new remoteness quotient needs to be developed to ensure funding to remote northern communities reflects the high costs of living and the extraordinary costs of providing services in those communities. The new remoteness quotient should take into account cost of living; demographics of northern communities where children and youth form a significantly higher percentage of the population than the rest of Canada; the high rates of child deaths; and, high youth suicide rates.\n[76] According to the NAN, the Barnes Report (Exhibit HR-11, Tab 219: David Barnes and Vijay Shankar, Northern Remoteness, Study and Analysis of Child Welfare Funding Model Implications on Two First Nations Agencies, Tikinagan Child and Family Services and Payukotayno: James Bay and Hudson Bay Family Services (Barnes Management Group Inc., 2006) provides a good example of what its proposed remoteness quotient could look like, and what a remoteness quotient could accomplish. However, the Barnes Report is specific to Ontario, identified several data gaps and was authored in 2006. As such, the NAN requests that an update to the Barnes Report be funded by the Federal government. The NAN further proposes that experts be engaged to develop a new remoteness quotient based on the Barnes Report and that the selection of the experts be by joint-agreement between the NAN and the Federal government. If no agreement is reached within a reasonable but short timeframe, it requests the Panel select the appropriate experts.\n[77] While a robust, empirically-based remoteness Quotient is being developed, the NAN submits adjustments reflecting northern remoteness realities can be undertaken in the immediate term and looks forward to working collaboratively with the parties on the mechanics of these adjustments.\n[78] Whereas the NAN\u2019s submissions were mainly focused on the application of a robust remoteness quotient to determine funding for its own communities in Ontario, the AFN submits that the application of remoteness factors ought to be considered across Canada. Similarly, the Caring Society submits remoteness issues should not be dealt with through an \u201cupdate\u201d of the Barnes Report but rather as part of a comprehensive special study for Ontario and as part of the NAC process. The COO also expects the NAC process and the Ontario Special Study to yield data to inform a remoteness quotient, which in turn will inform programming and funding models.\n[79] For its part, INAC states that it will engage on undertaking and providing support for research on this topic, building on the research contained in the Barnes Report, to analyze a possible remoteness quotient.\n[80] The Panel agrees with the NAN that a remoteness quotient needs to be developed as part of medium to long term relief and that data needs to be appropriately collected. The Panel is also pleased to learn that INAC will engage on undertaking and providing support for research on this topic and to discuss a possible remoteness quotient. The Caring Society and the COO have provided interesting suggestions on how to develop a remoteness quotient. This topic will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[81] The Panel again agrees with the NAN that while a robust, empirically-based remoteness quotient is being developed, adjustments reflecting northern remoteness realities can be undertaken in the immediate term. The Panel also agrees with the AFN that this should not only apply to Ontario but, rather, the application of remoteness factors ought to be considered across Canada. As indicated above at paragraph 36, in 2016 CHRT 10 the Panel ordered INAC to immediately address how it determines funding for remote FNCFS Agencies. That determination should account for such things as travel to provide or access services; the higher cost of living and service delivery in remote communities; the ability of remote FNCFS Agencies to recruit and retain staff; and, the compounded effect of reducing core funding for remote agencies that may also be small agencies (for example, see Decision at paras. 213-233 and 291). A standardized, one- size-fits-all approach to determining funding for remote agencies affects their overall ability to provide services and results in adverse impacts for many First Nations children and families. The Panel orders INAC to provide detailed information in its compliance report to clearly demonstrate how it is determining funding for remote FNCFS Agencies that allows them to meet the actual needs of the communities they serve. This will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nC. Allocation of immediate relief funding\n[82] INAC has indicated that Budget 2016 will provide new investments in Ontario of approximately $5.8 million in 2016-17. By 2019-20, the total annual allocation for prevention services in Ontario First Nations will be approximately $1,160 per child: an increase of approximately $560 per child from the current amount of funding.\n[83] In order to provide immediate relief to children in Ontario, the CCI Parties submit that the funding should be distributed to Ontario First Nations regardless of the provincial government\u2019s concurrence. The CCI Parties further requests that a deadline be set for the distribution of those funds. According to the COO, it is in the process of arranging meetings with INAC and the Province of Ontario to discuss how the budgeted amount of funding for Ontario was determined and how it can be distributed. As such, it requests that INAC provide further information to assess the sufficiency of funding and ongoing reporting to ensure compliance with its commitments.\n[84] The CCI Parties also submit that Budget 2016 investments do not address inflation. Therefore, they request INAC pay an amount of $5 million, adjusted for the compound rate of inflation from 2012 values pursuant to the Consumer Price Index, to be divided among FNCFS Agencies in Ontario.\n[85] INAC submits that it cannot flow funds to Ontario via the 1965 Agreement without the Province\u2019s concurrence. At this time, Ontario has not agreed to allow immediate relief funding to be flowed through the 1965 Agreement. Rather, according to INAC, Ontario has proposed that an alternative approach be found to create an interim arrangement outside of the 1965 Agreement for INAC to flow funds for immediate relief. INAC states that it is actively working with the Province to find a means to provide immediate relief funding as soon as possible and is prepared to immediately flow the funding for on-reserve preventative services within Budget 2016 commitments. However, before any options are finalized, INAC will seek support from First Nations leadership. As work on the allocation of immediate relief funding in Ontario is ongoing, INAC requests the Tribunal not impose a deadline and instead allow the parties to work collaboratively to address this issue.\n[86] With regard to the additional amount for inflation, INAC submits that its Budget 2016 investments account for cost drivers and yearly growth, for a five year investment of $70.5 million in additional program funding for service providers in Ontario.\n[87] The Panel acknowledges INAC\u2019s investments and explanation. As work on the allocation of immediate relief funding in Ontario is ongoing, the Tribunal will not impose a deadline and instead will allow the parties to work collaboratively to address this issue. This is with the understanding that it will be addressed immediately and not delayed further. However, the Panel expects an update from INAC on this issue as part of its compliance report, and asks that it disclose the correspondence with the Province of Ontario referred to in its submissions. This will also be addressed during the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[88] Similarly, for the same reasons mentioned in paragraph 55 above, the Panel needs additional information on the request for additional funding to address inflation. There is no doubt that inflation is a key factor which impacts overall service delivery and agency capacity to deliver those services. This was addressed in the Decision at paragraphs 311, 387 and 458. However, given the lack of detailed information regarding the determination of funding for future \u201ccost drivers and yearly growth\u201d the Panel is unable to assess if in fact INAC\u2019s investments are responsive to the needs of Ontario FNCFS Agencies. The Panel orders INAC to provide detailed information in its compliance report to clearly demonstrate how it has determined funding to account for future \u201ccost drivers and yearly growth\u201d and will discuss this issue at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nD. Expanding the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019\n[89] The CCI Parties request an order that the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 in the 1965 Agreement be expanded to include special needs rehabilitative and support services and respite care. The CCI Parties submit that if special needs supports and respite care are provided as a form of prevention services, this may lead to a reduction of children in care. Families will no longer have to make the decision between keeping their families together and having a child\u2019s special needs unassessed or supported or breaking families apart by placing a child in care with an increased opportunity that the child will have better access to supports.\n[90] Relatedly, the CCI Parties submit that children with special needs are at a significantly higher-than-normal risk of being apprehended due to their inability to travel to get access to the care and services they require. That is, children perceived to be in a position where they are not being provided with required care by their families may be viewed as children in need of protection. Funding for travel to access special needs services and assessments is not provided for under the 1965 Agreement. Therefore, the CCI Parties request that the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 under the 1965 Agreement include funding for travel to access all physician-prescribed health services, including special needs assessments and services.\n[91] Finally, the CCI Parties request that the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 under the 1965 Agreement be expanded to include the supports for families in crisis identified under Ontario\u2019s recently announced Family Well-Being Program; and that Canada match the Ontario Government\u2019s financial commitment of $80 million over three years to serve families in crisis under the Family Well-Being Program.\n[92] In response, INAC states that it looks forward to participating in discussions on the Province of Ontario's definition of 'prevention services' and is committed to working with other federal partners, as well as Ontario and First Nations partners, to discuss the supports needed to reduce or prevent First Nations children from coming into care. However, it argues the request for a unilateral order expanding the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 under the 1965 Agreement is not appropriate. That is, the 1965 Agreement is between the Federal government and the Province of Ontario and will require joint provincial and federal agreement to undertake changes.\n[93] The COO suggests that any order for an expanded definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 be considered in the medium to long term relief stage, to allow for planning and consultation with First Nations, child welfare agencies or other proposed service providers; and to ensure that the appropriate service provider can be identified, has the required mandate, and is willing and able to provide such services.\n[94] The Panel made findings in the Decision with regard to the services covered by the 1965 Agreement, along with the difficulties faced by some First Nations children and families in accessing services in remote Ontario communities (see paras 223-244). However, the Panel agrees with the COO\u2019s suggestion above that expanding the definition of \u2018prevention services\u2019 in the 1965 Agreement should be considered in the medium to long term. That said, as part of INAC\u2019s immediate relief investments, which are being coordinated on an interim basis outside of the 1965 Agreement, and until an expanded definition of prevention services can be considered, INAC should consider reimbursing costs for travel to access physician-prescribed special needs services and assessments, special needs rehabilitative and support services and respite care, and support for families in crisis. The Panel expects a detailed response from INAC on this issue and will discuss the issue with all parties at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nE. Reinstate cost-sharing of capital expenditures\n[95] The CCI Parties request an order that INAC reinstate the cost-sharing of capital expenditures under the 1965 Agreement at the same allocation of 90%, as provided for in clause 4 of the Agreement.\n[96] In response, INAC states that it will engage on the broader issue of infrastructure needs for the FNCFS Program as part of long-term reform efforts.\n[97] As noted in the Decision, the 1965 Agreement has not provided for the cost-sharing of capital expenditures since 1975 and, as a result, many FNCFS Agencies in Ontario lack funding to establish infrastructure necessary to deliver statutory child protection services (see paras. 244-245). Therefore, as part of INAC\u2019s immediate relief investments, which are being coordinated on an interim basis outside of the 1965 Agreement, and until the broader issue of infrastructure needs under the 1965 Agreement can be fully reviewed, INAC should develop an interim strategy to deal with the infrastructure needs of FNCFS Agencies. The Panel expects a detailed response from INAC on this issue and will discuss the issue with all parties at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nF. Eligibility\n[98] According to the CCI Parties, in order to be eligible for federal funding under the cost-sharing formula of the 1965 Agreement, children and youth must be: 1) registered Indians; and, 2) resident on reserve, Crown land, or off reserve less than 12 months. They submit that this residency and status requirement under the 1965 Agreement has a significantly negative impact on children and youth who are entitled to be registered, but for a variety of reasons, have not been. In this regard, the CCI Parties suggest that the documentation requirements for registering a child at birth or while still young present a serious challenge. Therefore, they request that the 1965 Agreement\u2019s residency and registered status requirements be amended to ensure that not only children and youth who are registered are eligible for services, but also children and youth who are entitled to be registered.\n[99] According to INAC, residency and registered status is a national issue that will require the development of a comprehensive approach in collaboration with key partners. INAC states that it will pursue discussions on this issue as part of long-term reform efforts.\n[100] Although eligibility under the 1965 Agreement is not discussed per se in the Decision, the need for review and update of the Agreement was discussed in detail (see for example paras. 223-228). The Panel agrees that a comprehensive approach to eligibility needs to be developed in collaboration with key partners and that it is best addressed at the long term stage when the 1965 Agreement is reformed. However, as part of INAC\u2019s immediate relief investments, which are being coordinated on an interim basis outside of the 1965 Agreement, INAC should also consider addressing access to services for First Nations children \u2018entitled to be registered\u2019. The Panel expects a detailed response from INAC on this issue and will discuss the issue with all parties at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nG. Special study\n[101] The CCI Parties request that, within one year, a special study be performed of the application of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario. The study would be conducted by experts and through a mechanism developed through the agreement of the parties, and with accompanying funding that allows for the meaningful participation of FNCFS Agencies, First Nations governments, INAC and the Province of Ontario. According to the CCI Parties, the study would determine the adequacy of the 1965 Agreement in achieving comparability of services; culturally appropriate services that account for historical disadvantage; and, ensuring the best interest of the child are paramount. Ultimately, the results of the study would inform medium to long term reforms to the 1965 Agreement.\n[102] The NAN agrees with the proposed study, but submits that it should specifically include a component that thoroughly reviews and addresses the effect of the 1965 Agreement on northern remote communities. Also, it submits the study should include a comprehensive data collection component and the data be made available publicly.\n[103] As noted in the Decision, the 1965 Agreement has never undergone a formal review by INAC. The Panel agrees with the CCI Parties that a study would greatly assist in determining the adequacy of the 1965 Agreement in achieving comparability of services; culturally appropriate services that account for historical disadvantage; and, ensuring the best interest of the child are paramount (see Decision at paras. 223-227). A study would also inform long-term reform to the 1965 Agreement by identifying concrete measures INAC can take to redress the discrimination found in the Decision with respect to the 1965 Agreement. While INAC has generally indicated that it is open to reviewing the 1965 Agreement, its submissions did not specifically address the CCI Parties\u2019 request for a special study.\n[104] Therefore, the Panel will reserve making an order with respect to the special study in Ontario pending a specific response from INAC on the issue. The Panel expects a detailed response from INAC on this issue prior to the upcoming in-person case management meeting and will further discuss the issue with the parties at that time.\nH. One-time contingency fund\n[105] The NAN requests an order for a one-time contingency fund to alleviate funding shortfalls for agencies serving remote and northern communities. According to the NAN, ameliorating the effects of existing deficits and debts will give more room and flexibility for such agencies to address the live, pressing and complex needs of children and families using child welfare services in remote and northern communities.\n[106] This request was provided in the NAN\u2019s reply and therefore was not commented upon by the other parties. This request will form part of the upcoming in-person case management discussions.\nV. Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[107] In the Decision, the Panel found Canada\u2019s definition and implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle to be narrow and inadequate, resulting in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children. Namely, delays were inherently built into the Federal government\u2019s process for dealing with potential Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. It was also unclear why the government\u2019s approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle cases focused on inter-governmental disputes in situations where a child has multiple disabilities, as opposed to all jurisdictional disputes (including between federal government departments) involving all First Nations children (see the Decision at paras. 379-382 and 458).\n[108] In 2016 CHRT 10, the Panel ordered INAC to immediately consider Jordan\u2019s Principle as including all jurisdictional disputes (including disputes between federal government departments) and involving all First Nations children (not only those children with multiple disabilities). It added that, pursuant to the purpose and intent of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the government organization that is first contacted should pay for the service without the need for policy review or case conferencing before funding is provided.\n[109] In response to that ruling, INAC indicated that it took the following steps to implement the Panel\u2019s order:\nA. It expanded Jordan\u2019s Principle by eliminating the requirement that the First Nations child on reserve must have multiple disabilities that require multiple service providers;\nB. It expanded Jordan\u2019s Principle to apply to all jurisdictional disputes and now includes those between federal government departments;\nC. Services for any Jordan\u2019s Principle case will not be delayed due to case conferencing or policy review; and\nD. Working level committees comprised of Health Canada and INAC officials, Director Generals and Assistant Deputy Ministers will provide oversight and will guide the implementation of the new application of Jordan\u2019s Principle and provide for an appeals function.\n[110] In order to implement this new approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle, Canada has indicated that it will invest up to $382 million in new funding over three years. It will also engage with First Nations, the provinces and the Yukon on a long-term strategy over that time. Furthermore, Canada has indicated that it will provide an annual report on Jordan\u2019s Principle, including the number of cases tracked and the amount of funding spent to address specific cases. INAC has also updated its website to reflect the changes above, including posting contact information for individuals encountering a Jordan\u2019s Principle case. Further, it is assessing whether an off-business hour mechanism needs to be put in place.\n[111] Moving forward, INAC states engagement will be a key component of its new approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle. It adds that Health Canada and INAC have written jointly to provinces and territories to initiate discussions related to Jordan's Principle. First Nations leaders will also be engaged on the design, management and delivery of the new approach to Jordan's Principle as well as longer-term policy and program reform. Moreover, INAC and Health Canada senior officials will meet with the AFN to discuss next steps and to develop specific details on implementation of a child-first approach. At the same time, headquarters and regional executives will engage their First Nations partners on the proposed approach.\n[112] The CCI Parties request INAC provide further information and reporting on its implementation of the order and commitments above. They specifically ask for the following:\n\u00b7 Details of how Canada will consult with the parties, First Nations and FNCFS Agencies regarding all matters related to Jordan\u2019s Principle;\n\u00b7 Details as to what action INAC has taken to comply with the \u201cgovernment of first contact\u201d provision in the order;\n\u00b7 Confirmation that INAC is applying Jordan's Principle to all jurisdictional disputes;\n\u00b7 Confirmation that INAC is applying Jordan\u2019s Principle to all First Nations children;\n\u00b7 Clarification as to what process will be followed to manage Jordan\u2019s Principle cases, how urgent cases will be addressed, and what accountability and transparency measures have been built into that process to ensure compliance with the order; and\n\u00b7 Clarification as to how Canada will ensure that First Nations and FNCFS Agencies are part of the consultation process with the provinces\/territories, and in other elements of the implementation of Jordan's Principle.\n[113] The CCI Parties further request that INAC post and keep up-to-date information regarding its implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle, including its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, assessment criteria and process, remediation and appeal mechanism. Furthermore, on an annual basis, the CCI Parties request that INAC post non-identifying data on the number of Jordan\u2019s Principle referrals made, the disposition of those cases and the time frame for disposition, as well as the result of independent appeals. Finally, the CCI Parties request that INAC provide all First Nations and FNCFS Agencies with the names and contact information of the Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points in all regions and inform the First Nations and FNCFS Agencies in question of any changes of such.\n[114] The Panel is pleased with Canada\u2019s stated changes and investments in enacting the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle, but shares many of the same questions with respect to consultation and implementation as the CCI Parties. First, it would be helpful to the Panel and the other parties for INAC to provide a list of the First Nations, FNCFS Agencies, provincial and territorial authorities, partners, experts or any other persons it has consulted with so far with regard to Jordan\u2019s Principle, along with its consultation plan moving forward. The list of any past consultations from January to September 2016 should include the agenda and summary of the discussions.\n[115] INAC has also indicated that an interim guidance document was issued to regional Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points directing regional staff to \u201censure that needed services for children will not be delayed due to case conferencing or policy review.\u201d However, Canada\u2019s submissions are unclear on the process that is being followed in dealing with a Jordan\u2019s Principle case. Canada\u2019s submissions state:\n\u00b7 Health Canada and INAC will provide further direction to their staff to initiate the implementation of this approach, as well as support the resolution of disputes or service gaps over the next three years based on provincial normative standards;\n\u00b7 Senior officials will engage with First Nations at the national and regional levels to plan the design and the implementation of the Service Coordination function and develop an effective approach to organize services for First Nations children on-reserve with disabilities;\n\u00b7 Further management of any such case will be done in a manner that will ensure the appropriate service or suite of services is being implemented in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 Additional training and orientation of focal points to the new definition and expanded scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle will begin immediately;\n\u00b7 A governance structure will be established to deal with Jordan\u2019s Principle cases when they arise; and\n\u00b7 Appeals will be heard in an expeditious way to ensure children with disabilities receive services in a timely manner.\n[116] With regard to INAC\u2019s submissions above, the Panel is unclear as to what the current process is for dealing with Jordan\u2019s Principle cases and\/or who is involved in processing these cases (INAC employees, social workers, health professionals, etc.). The Panel directs INAC to provide the following information:\n\u00b7 Details as to what action INAC has taken to comply with the \u201cgovernment of first contact\u201d provision in the order;\n\u00b7 Clarification as to what process will be followed to manage Jordan\u2019s Principle cases, how urgent cases will be addressed, and what accountability and transparency measures have been built into that process to ensure compliance with the order;\n\u00b7 Clarification as to how Canada will ensure that First Nations, FNCFS Agencies and the CCI Parties are part of the consultation process with the provinces\/territories, and in other elements of the implementation of Jordan's Principle; and\n\u00b7 Provide all First Nations and FNCFS Agencies with the names and contact information of the Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points in all regions and inform the First Nations and FNCFS Agencies in question of any changes of such.\n[117] On the issue of the breadth of INAC\u2019s new formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the Panel notes that the motion unanimously passed by the House of Commons did not restrict the application of the principle solely to First Nations children on reserve, but to all First Nations children: \u201cthe government should immediately adopt a child first principle, based on Jordan's Principle, to resolve jurisdictional disputes involving the care of First Nations children\u201d (see Decision at para. 353, emphasis added). INAC\u2019s formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle is also not in line with the eligibility requirements for its own FNCFS Program, which applies to First Nations \u201cresident on reserve or Ordinarily Resident On Reserve\u201d (see ss. 1.3.2 and 1.3.7 of the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual and s. 1.1 of the 2012 National Social Programs Manual at paras. 52-53 of the Decision). That is, the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle only to First Nations children living on reserve is more restrictive than the definition included in INAC\u2019s FNCFS Program. This type of restriction will likely create gaps for First Nations children and is not in line with the Decision (see paras. 362, 364-382 and 391).\n[118] The Panel notes that, in responding to the findings in the Decision on Jordan\u2019s Principle, INAC\u2019s rationale for its new formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle was in reference to two paragraphs of the Decision (see Respondent\u2019s Further Reply Submissions Re Immediate Relief, Justice Canada, July 6, 2016 at pp. 22-23), which it narrowly interpreted as indicating that Jordan\u2019s Principle should only apply to First Nations children on reserve. This type of narrow analysis is to be discouraged moving forward as it can lead to discrimination as found in the Decision. Rather, consistent with the motion unanimously adopted by the House of Commons, the Panel orders INAC to immediately apply Jordan\u2019s Principle to all First Nations children, not only to those residing on reserve.\n[119] INAC\u2019s new formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle also appears to narrow its application to only those First Nations children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports.\u201d Without additional information, this formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle once again appears to be more restrictive than formulated by the House of Commons. The Panel requests that INAC explain in its compliance report why it formulated its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle as such so that it can assess its full impact. This will also form part of the discussions at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\n[120] Finally, the Panel is satisfied that INAC has confirmed it is applying Jordan's Principle to all jurisdictional disputes. The Panel will assess this application through ongoing reporting.\nVI. Other requested orders\nA. No reductions in funding\n[121] The CCI Parties request that INAC be ordered not to decrease or further restrict funding for First Nations child and family services or children\u2019s services covered by Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[122] INAC agrees not to decrease or further restrict funding for First Nations child and family services or children\u2019s services covered by Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[123] The Panel acknowledges INAC\u2019s undertaking above and will incorporate it in its order below.\nB. Adoption of the principle that children and youth living in residential care must live as close as possible to their home communities\n[124] The CCI Parties request an order that Canada adopt the principle that children and youth living in residential care must live as close as possible to their home communities and that necessary funding and resources be provided to ensure this fundamental principle is met.\n[125] INAC submits that the decision on placement of a child brought into care is at the service providers\u2019 discretion. However, as part of the reform to the FNCFS Program, INAC states it will engage service providers, the provinces\/territory and any other relevant partner, including First Nations leadership and organizations, to facilitate opportunities for children placed in care outside of their communities to maintain a connection to their communities and cultures.\n[126] This request will form part of the upcoming in-person case management discussions.\nC. National Advisory Committee\n[127] INAC has committed to the reestablishment of the NAC, and discussions with the AFN and the Caring Society on the formation of the committee are underway.\n[128] The NAN requests an order that it be granted representation at the NAC and regional roundtables. Further, the NAN requests that the NAC include a northern remoteness subcommittee with representation from the NAN. Alternatively, if the Panel finds that the NAN\u2019s proposal is premature, it requests that a deadline or schedule be set, by which the NAC, subcommittees and regional tables should be struck.\n[129] INAC is supportive of the NAN's proposal to have a northern remoteness subcommittee included as part of the work of the NAC and states that it will raise this with the committee.\n[130] The AFN submits that it would be premature to incorporate the NAC or its composition into an order. The parties envision the NAC as being a mechanism to address medium to long-term reforms of the FNCFS Program and the parties are focused on immediate relief at this stage.\n[131] The Panel will address this issue at the upcoming in-person case management.\nD. Canadian Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect\n[132] The CCI Parties request that INAC be ordered to immediately fund a new iteration of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, including data collection specific to remote and northern First Nations communities.\n[133] According to INAC, it is currently in the process of working with the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide funding for the Aboriginal component of the Canadian Incidence Study.\n[134] The Panel believes a new iteration of the Canadian Incidence Study would be a useful tool in further informing reform to the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement. The Panel also acknowledges INAC\u2019s willingness to fund the Aboriginal component of the study as indicated above. The Panel expects INAC to indicate in its report if indeed it is providing funding for the Aboriginal component of the Canadian Incidence Study, including whether that component of the study will include data collection specific to remote and northern First Nations communities.\nE. Updating policies, procedures and agreements\n[135] The CCI Parties request that INAC be ordered to update its policies, procedures (including FNCFS Agency reporting procedures) and contribution agreements to comply with the Panel\u2019s order and communicate such reforms in detail and in writing to First Nations, FNCFS Agencies and the public.\n[136] According to INAC, reform of the FNCFS Program will involve a redesign of its funding models, policies and procedures. However, such work will require significant analysis and collaboration with all relevant key partners and is therefore a longer-term process. In the interim, INAC submits that using existing funding mechanisms and procedures will ensure children and families continue receiving services and will prevent any disruption to services. It states that it will work with its partners to update and adjust processes as needed for next fiscal year.\n[137] In the Panel\u2019s view, the request to update policies, procedures and agreements is captured by its general order to reform the FNCFS Program and 1965 Agreement in compliance with the findings in the Decision. For clarity, the Panel orders INAC to update its policies, procedures and agreements to comply with the Panel\u2019s findings in the Decision. The Panel understands this reform will be achieved in the longer term, with certain interim measures being put in place until that time as addressed in this ruling. Considering the central importance of this matter and the need for a process along with interim measures to be put in place, this request will also form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nF. Training and performance metrics for federal public servants\n[138] The CCI Parties request INAC be ordered to ensure that its executives and staff receive 15 hours of mandatory training on: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s final report (December 2015); the FNCFS Program (including formula development, assumptions, and program reviews); the Decision; and on the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle. It requests this training occur before August 31, 2016 and in a manner approved by the Commission and the Complainants.\n[139] Relatedly, the CCI Parties also request that the annual performance evaluations of federal public servants who provide services to Aboriginal Peoples, or who assign work related thereto, include metrics designed to demonstrate how each individual has contributed to closing the socio-economic gap with respect to Aboriginal Peoples. It further requests that Canada develop mandatory intercultural competency programming for these employees.\n[140] In response, INAC indicates that it looks forward to further discussions on improving the cultural sensitivity of its employees. However, it submits that the request that staff undertake specific training is beyond the scope of the complaint and seeking to have all staff trained is overly broad. Further, it submits the performance evaluations of specific federal public servants was not at issue in the complaint, nor were allegations made against specific employees. In INAC\u2019s view, the performance metrics request goes beyond the scope of the complaint, including any mandatory programming related thereto.\n[141] Given that INAC is open to further discussions on this issue, the Panel will address this issue at the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nG. Funding for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network\n[142] The hearings in this matter were recorded and broadcasted by the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (the APTN) pursuant to operating guidelines for coverage approved by the Panel (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2012 CHRT 18; and First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2012 CHRT 23). One of those guidelines required APTN to retain the recordings of the hearing for three years.\n[143] As the three-year period will be coming to an end shortly, and given the legal, social, moral and political importance of this case, the CCI Parties request that INAC be ordered to immediately provide $30,000 to the APTN to transfer the tapes of the Tribunal hearings onto a publicly accessible format and provide sufficient funds to the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation to store and manage public access to the tapes.\n[144] In response, INAC submits that the APTN was not a party to the complaint and, as such, the Tribunal should not grant it relief as part of the remedies. However, it is willing to further consider this undertaking.\n[145] The Panel supports and believes in APTN\u2019s work and mission. It was very pleased with their involvement in filming the hearings in this matter. However, the Panel will not make the order requested. The Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 (CanLII), at para. 37). The APTN is not a party to this complaint, nor is it a victim of the discriminatory practices at issue. While there is no doubt that this case has a legal, social, moral and political importance that merited public broadcasting, this public interest is not linked to any findings of discrimination.\n[146] Although the Panel will not make the order requested, it notes INAC is favorable to fund the transfer of the recordings. Given the recordings are of great importance and public interest, the Panel encourages INAC to do so.\nH. Review decisions with respect to funding new agencies\n[147] The CCI Parties request that INAC be ordered to review decisions to deny funding to support the development and operation of FNCFS Agencies, particularly with regard to the applications for new agencies by the Okanagan Nation Alliance and the Carcross First Nation.\n[148] INAC believes this to be an important topic to be addressed through partner engagement on the FNCFS Program reform. Given the provincial\/territorial legislative authority, this will require engagement and agreement with provincial and territorial governments, as well as with First Nations partners.\n[149] Before contemplating an order, the Panel believes this request would benefit from further discussion as part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nI. Funding for research, scholarships and conferences\n[150] The CCI Parties request that, for a minimum of ten years, INAC fully fund research and scholarships in relation to measuring the provision of child welfare services for First Nations children, along with issues such as control over and access to education, the revitalization of Indigenous legal orders, access to the economy and control over lands and resources. Further, they submit that such research and scholarship funding should be managed by an independent scholar-based oversight body. Thereafter, the CCI Parties request INAC fund annual conferences for the presentation of the research findings emanating from the above and that federal public servants involved in the provision of services to Aboriginal Peoples be required to attend.\n[151] While INAC is open to further discussions on supporting research, it argues this specific request falls outside the scope of the FNCFS Program.\n[152] Given that INAC is open to further discussion, this request will form part of the upcoming in-person case management meeting.\nJ. Appoint the Commission to engage all parties and create a draft order\n[153] The AFN requests that INAC be ordered to engage in consultations with the Commission on immediate measures to redress the discrimination identified in the Decision. It asks that the Commission be appointed to engage all parties in a discussion on immediate relief and thereafter create a draft order, including specific dates for INAC to implement all of the elements of immediate relief. The Commission would then be required to submit the draft order, agreed upon by all parties, within 60 days of the date of this ruling.\n[154] Furthermore, the AFN submits that the Panel should order INAC, or direct the Commission, to address the issue of resourcing the parties to ensure their meaningful participation in the process.\n[155] INAC submits that it has already addressed a number of immediate relief measures, such as providing increased funding to FNCFS Agencies through an updated and improved funding formula. It would like to move forward with addressing medium and long-term reform through engagement with key partners. According to INAC, all work to reform the FNCFS Program will include engagement with key partners such as FNCFS Agencies, First Nations communities and leadership, the provinces, the Yukon Territory and the parties to this complaint.\n[156] The AFN\u2019s request above was submitted in reply and the other CCI Parties did not have an opportunity to respond thereto. Therefore, this request could form part of discussions at the upcoming in-person case management meeting. INAC has also indicated it is open to providing funds for the CCI Parties\u2019 participation in meetings. Therefore, the Panel would like to know if INAC is agreeable to provide funds for the CCI Parties\u2019 participation in the upcoming in-person case management meeting and any subsequent meetings.\nVII. Order\n[157] In the Decision, INAC was ordered to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement to reflect the Panel\u2019s findings and to cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan's Principle (see at para. 481). As mentioned above, the CCI Parties\u2019 request to update policies, procedures and agreements is captured by this general order to reform the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement in compliance with the findings in the Decision. For clarity, the Panel orders INAC to update its policies, procedures and agreements to comply with the Panel\u2019s findings in the Decision.\n[158] In addition, to address this general order in the short term, INAC was subsequently ordered to immediately take measures to address a number of items. As indicated in 2016 CHRT 10 and reiterated in this ruling, those items were to be addressed immediately. Again, those items include addressing the adverse impacts related to the assumptions about the number of children in care, families in need of services and population levels; remote and\/or small FNCFS agencies; inflation\/cost of living; changing service standards; salaries and benefits; training; legal costs; insurance premiums; travel; multiple offices; capital infrastructure; culturally appropriate programs and services; and, least disruptive measures. INAC was then ordered to report back to the Panel to explain how those items are being addressed in the short term to provide immediate relief to First Nations children on reserve (see 2016 CHRT 10 at paras. 20 and 23).\n[159] INAC was also ordered to immediately consider Jordan\u2019s Principle as including all jurisdictional disputes (including disputes between federal government departments) and involving all First Nations children (not only those children with multiple disabilities). Pursuant to the purpose and intent of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the Panel also indicated that the government organization that is first contacted should pay for the service without the need for policy review or case conferencing before funding is provided (see 2016 CHRT 10 at para. 33).\n[160] In addition to the orders in the Decision and in 2016 CHRT 10, and pursuant to the ruling above, the Panel orders as follows.\nA. Additional Immediate measures to be taken\n1. INAC will not decrease or further restrict funding for First Nations child and family services or children\u2019s services covered by Jordan\u2019s Principle (see paras. 121-123 above);\n2. INAC will determine budgets for each individual FNCFS Agency based on an evaluation of its distinct needs and circumstances, including an appropriate evaluation of how remoteness may affect the FNCFS Agency\u2019s ability to provide services (see paras. 33, 37, 40 and 47 above);\n3. In determining funding for FNCFS Agencies, INAC is to establish the assumptions of 6% of children in care and 20% of families in need of services as minimum standards only. INAC will not reduce funding to FNCFS Agencies because the number of children in care they serve is below 6% or where the number of families in need of services is below 20% (see para. 38 above);\n4. In determining funding for FNCFS Agencies that have more that 6% of children in care and\/or that serve more than 20% of families, INAC is ordered to determine funding for those agencies based on an assessment of the actual levels of children in care and families in need of services (see para. 39 above);\n5. In determining funding for FNCFS Agencies, INAC is to cease the practice of formulaically reducing funding for agencies that serve fewer than 251 eligible children. Rather, funding must be determined on an assessment of the actual service level needs of each FNCFS Agency, regardless of population level (see para. 40 above);\n6. INAC is to cease the practice of requiring FNCFS Agencies to recover cost overruns related to maintenance from their prevention and\/or operations funding streams (see paras. 56-61 above); and\n7. INAC is to immediately apply Jordan\u2019s Principle to all First Nations children (not only to those resident on reserve) (see paras. 117-118 above).\nB. Reporting\n1. By October 31, 2016, INAC is to provide a detailed compliance report indicating:\na. How it has complied with the immediate measures ordered above in section A of this order;\nb. How it is immediately addressing funding for legal fees (see para. 48 above);\nc. How it is immediately addressing the costs of building repairs where a FNCFS Agency has received a notice to the effect that repairs must be done to comply with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations, or where there is other evidence of non-compliance with applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations (see para. 49 above);\nd. How it determined funding for each FNCFS Agency for the child service purchase amount and the receipt, assessment and investigation of child protection reports (see para. 50 above);\ne. How much it is allocating for each \u201cgrowth and future cost driver\u201d and to detail how it arrived at its corresponding allocations for each FNCFS Agency, including for Ontario (see paras. 51-55 above);\nf. How new funding is immediately addressing the adverse effects identified with respect to the 1965 Agreement, especially in terms of mental health services and Band Representatives (see paras. 69-74 above);\ng. How it determined funding for remote FNCFS Agencies that allows them to meet the actual needs of the communities they serve, taking into account such things as travel to provide or access services, the higher cost of living and service delivery in remote communities and the ability of remote FNCFS Agencies to recruit and retain staff (see paras. 75-81 above);\nh. How immediate relief funding is being distributed in Ontario (see paras. 82-88 above);\ni. How it has complied with the order to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle (see paras. 107-120 above), including:\ni. confirmation that it is applying the principle to all First Nations children (not just to those resident on reserve);\nii. an explanation as to why it formulated the application of the principle to children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports\u201d;\niii. details as to what action it has taken to comply with the \u201cgovernment of first contact\u201d provision in the order;\niv. clarification as to what process will be followed to manage Jordan\u2019s Principle cases, how urgent cases will be addressed, and what accountability and transparency measures have been built into that process to ensure compliance with the order;\nv. clarification as to how it will ensure that First Nations, CCI Parties and FNCFS Agencies are part of the consultation process with the provinces\/territories, and in other elements of the implementation of Jordan's Principle;\nvi. providing all First Nations and FNCFS Agencies with the names and contact information of the Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points in all regions and informing them of any changes of such; and\nj. If it is providing funding for the Aboriginal component of the Canadian Incidence Study, including whether that component of the study will include data collection specific to remote and northern First Nations communities (see paras. 132-134 above).\nC. Additional information to be provided\n1. By September 30, 2016, INAC is directed to serve and file:\nThe rationale, data and any other relevant information it states it used to determine its five-year plan for investing in the FNCFS Program and in determining budgets for each FNCFS Agency, including its cost driver study and trend analysis documentation, how it arrived at financial projections beyond fiscal year 2016-2017, any steps taken to ensure comparability of staff salaries and benefit packages to provincial rates, the information used to determine the caseload ratios in Quebec and Manitoba and, generally, how it determined values for off-hour emergency services, staff travel, agency audits, insurance and legal services; and\nThe correspondence with the Province of Ontario referred to in its submissions (see paras. 85-87).\n2. By October 31, 2016, INAC is directed to serve and file:\na. A list of the First Nations, FNCFS Agencies, provincial and territorial authorities, partners, experts or any other persons it has consulted with so far in response to the findings in the Decision and Jordan\u2019s Principle, along with its consultation plan moving forward. The list of any past consultations from January to September 2016 should include the agenda and summary of the discussions (see paras. 42 and 114 above);\nb. A response indicating its views on the request that it reimburse costs for travel to access physician-prescribed special needs services and assessments, special needs rehabilitative and support services and respite care, and support for families in crisis as part of immediate relief investments in Ontario (see para. 94 above);\nc. A response indicating its views on dealing with the infrastructure needs of FNCFS Agencies as part of immediate relief investments in Ontario (see para. 97 above);\nd. A response indicating its views on the request to expand the eligibility requirements of the 1965 Agreement as part of immediate relief investments in Ontario (see para. 100 above);\ne. A response indicating its views on the request that it conduct a special study on the application of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario (see paras. 103-104 above); and\nf. A response indicating if it is agreeable to providing funds for the CCI Parties\u2019 participation in the upcoming in-person case management meeting and any subsequent meetings (see para. 156 above).\nD. Retention of jurisdiction\n[161] Given the ongoing nature of the Panel\u2019s orders, and given the Panel still needs to rule upon other outstanding remedial requests (see para. 4 above), the Panel will continue to maintain jurisdiction over this matter. Any further retention of jurisdiction will be re-evaluated following further reporting by INAC, the upcoming in-person case management meeting and any ruling on the other outstanding remedies.\nVIII. In-person case management meeting\n[162] The Tribunal will be in contact with the parties shortly to schedule an in-person case management meeting between the Panel and the parties. Subject to the availability of those involved, the intention is to have the meeting as soon as is possible. As indicated throughout this ruling, there will be many items up for discussion. Any other outstanding issues can also be discussed at the meeting.\n[163] With the additional information and reporting requested as part of this ruling, the Panel\u2019s hope is that all outstanding short-term remedial requests can be resolved by the end of the meeting as to not delay immediate action any further. The Panel also hopes the meeting can be used to begin discussions on mid to long-term orders, including compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA. Therefore, the parties should anticipate several days for this meeting.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P. Lustig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 14, 2016\n",

Background\n[1] The Complainant submits that the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) had no authority to restrict the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) de novo assessment of the merits of the complaints raised. Since the Commission found sufficient reason to request the Tribunal to initiate an inquiry into the complaints, the inquiry should not be restricted to one issue.\n[2] Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cthe Respondents\u201d) submit that the Commission was clear in referring only one allegation to the Tribunal relying on the Decision of the Commission dated November 4, 2015 which says:\nThe Commission accepts the finding by the investigator that the evidence does support that there is an age-based distinction in L75.07 of LOU 75. The Commission decides to refer only this allegation to the Tribunal.\nB. Law\n[3] The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over a complaint until it has been referred to the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA or the \u201cAct\u201d) s.44 (3) for rejecting or referring a complaint. The Federal Court has confirmed that the proper way to challenge a Commission decision in respect of such matters is through judicial review by the Federal Court. (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2012 FC 1162 at para 56, decision affirmed by Lemire v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2014 FCA 18).\n[4] The scope of the referral is determined by looking at the letter from the Commission addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal, as this letter initiates the entire Tribunal inquiry process. This document determines whether the complaint has been referred in its entirety or not. One must look at whether there is specific language limiting the scope of a complaint or referring the complaint in its entirety. (Kanagasabapathy v. Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7 at paras 29-32 (\u201cKanagasabapathy\u201d)).\nC. Analysis & Ruling\n[5] Having considered the arguments submitted by the parties, I have decided that I will hear evidence and argument only on whether the allegation that L75.07 of LOU 75 is discriminatory based on age. I base my ruling on the letter from the Commission to the Chairperson of the Tribunal dated November 12, 2015:\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the allegation that L75.07 of LOU 75 is discriminatory based on age as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\n[6] The correspondence from the Commission contains qualifying language that limits the scope of the inquiry to the specific allegation of discrimination based on L75.07 of LOU 75.\n[7] The Respondents rely upon the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22 where the Tribunal found that correspondence from the Commission addressed to the parties and entitled \u201cDecision of the Commission\u201d, restricted the scope of an inquiry. However, as explained by the Tribunal in Kanagasabapathy, the Tribunal\u2019s approach was established in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. A.G. Canada, 2003 CHRT 32 which has been to rely upon the correspondence from the Commission addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal. Doing otherwise would result in \u201clooking behind\u201d the Commission\u2019s decision and exercising a supervisory jurisdiction over the actions and decisions of the Commission which falls within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court.\n[8] I have reviewed the Decision of the Commission dated November 4, 2015 which was relied upon by the Respondents. However, for the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal does not find the November 4, 2015 Decision of the Commission to be determinative of the scope of the referral to the Tribunal.\n[9] The Respondents argue that paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17B Issue #1, 18 and 20 are outside of the scope of the complaint before the Tribunal. Given the above assessment, I would agree with the Respondents.\nII. Expert witness and report\nA. Background\n[10] The Complainant provided their Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) and witness list, which did not include the name of the expert witness or a summary of the anticipated evidence. The Complainant also did not include the name of the Air Canada pilot, or former Air Canada pilot, who would speak to the adverse consequences of the loss of Group Disability Income Plan (\u201cGDIP\u201d) benefits.\n[11] The Complainant takes the position that Rule 6(3) requires only that an expert report be provided \u201cwithin a time fixed by the Panel\u201d and that requirement has not yet been met.\n[12] The Respondents have yet to provide their SOPs since they are waiting for the information from the Complainant. The Respondents submit that the Complainant must provide them with the name of the expert witness and summary of evidence with the SOP because \u201cthe Tribunal has already, pursuant to Rule 6(3), required that the Complainant provide such detailed information in its direction of January 18, 2016\u201d.\nB. Law\n[13] The Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure are more relaxed than the rules of a civil court. A Member may exercise his discretion provided that the decisions are in line with the purpose of the Rules of Procedure (Rule 1(1)):\ni. allowing the parties the opportunity to be heard\nii. to proceed in a timely and efficient manner\niii. proceedings are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n[14] Rule 6(3) provides the Tribunal Member with the flexibility to determine the timeline for expert reports. This flexibility must be in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice.\nC. Analysis & Ruling\n[15] As noted above, the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure are more relaxed than the rules of a civil court. Although the Respondents rely upon a Tribunal direction to seek disclosure of certain information prior to disclosure of their own SOPs, it is important to not further delay the matter due to the exchange of expert reports. As such, I will first deal with the exchange of SOPs. I am exercising my discretion within the purpose of the Rules of Procedure to make the following ruling:\nPursuant to Rule 6(1)(f), the Complainant will provide the name of the Air Canada pilot and a summary of his\/her expected testimony to the Respondents within two (2) weeks of the date of this ruling if he intends to call this witness.\nThe Respondents will file their SOPs within two (2) weeks of the receipt of notice from the Complainant that the Air Canada pilot will or will not be called as a witness.\nThe Respondents shall comply with Rule 6(1) and are not required to provide information regarding expert witnesses or expert reports in their SOPs.\n[16] Rule 6(3) provides me with the discretion to determine timelines for expert reports. I find that in light of the issues to date regarding expert witnesses, the parties shall first complete the exchange of SOPs. Following this, a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) will be scheduled by the Tribunal to discuss disclosure, procedural and any other issues prior to setting a date for a hearing. At such CMCC, the Complainant will advise if he intends to call an expert witness. If so, we will discuss a timeline for the disclosure of the expert witness\u2019 name, credentials, summary of evidence and report as well as any expert witness the Respondents may call.\nIII. Order\n[17] I make the following Orders:\n\u00b7 paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17B Issue #1, 18 and 20 are to be struck from the Complainant\u2019s SOP;\n\u00b7 The Complainant will provide the name of the Air Canada pilot and a summary of his\/her expected testimony to the Respondents within two (2) weeks of the date of this ruling if he intends to call this witness;\n\u00b7 The Respondents will file their SOPs within two (2) weeks of the receipt of notice from the Complainant that the Air Canada pilot will or will not be called as a witness;\n\u00b7 A CMCC will be scheduled by the Tribunal. At such CMCC, the Complainant shall advise if he intends to call an expert witness.\nSigned by\nAlex G. Pannu\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 28, 2016\n",

Lustig\nTable of Contents\nI. Background 1\nII. Parties\u2019 Positions on the Motion 3\nIII. Law and Analysis 4\nIV. Decision and Order 6\nI. Background\n[1] This is a ruling respecting a motion by the Complainant dated August 12, 2016, seeking an order amending the Complaint in this matter against Afroglobal Network Inc. (\u201cAfroglobal\u201d), to include allegations of retaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The Complaint against Afroglobal is undated and was received by the Commission on September 18, 2013. In it, the Complainant alleges discrimination against her by her employer Afroglobal between September 2011 and July 2013, on the basis of the prohibited ground of sex under section 3(1) of the Act, involving allegations of the discriminatory practices of adverse differential treatment and failure to provide a work environment free from sexual harassment, contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the Act.\n[3] The Complaint against Michael Daramola (\u201cDaramola\u201d) is dated September 18, 2013 and was received by the Commission on September 30, 2013. This Complaint is identical to the Complaint against Afroglobal. In it, the Complainant alleges discrimination against her by Daramola, who at the material times was a director and officer of her employer Afroglobal, on the basis of the prohibited ground of sex under section 3(1) of the Act, involving allegations of the discriminatory practice of sexual harassment, contrary to section 14 of the Act.\n[4] Sections 3(1), 7, 14 and 14.1 of the Act provide as follows:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n14. (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[5] By letter dated January 14, 2015 the Commission requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the Complaints pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act and requested that the Complaints be consolidated.\n[6] The Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, including particulars of the Retaliation claim, dated August 15, 2016 was included with the Notice of Motion. The Statement of Particulars alleges that after Afroglobal received notice of the Complaint from the Commission, in or about October of 2013, an offer of a job promotion that had been made to the Complainant by Afroglobal, in or about the summer of 2013, was resiled by Afroglobal as retaliation for her Complaint.\n[7] The Commission\u2019s Statement of Particulars is dated August 12, 2016 and its Reply to the motion is dated September 2, 2016.\n[8] Afroglobal\u2019s Statement of Particulars together with a response to the motion is dated September 16, 2016. The Statement of Particulars disputes the allegations of the Complainant respecting retaliation and alleges that the Complainant\u2019s allegations regarding retaliation are not factually correct.\n[9] Daramola\u2019s Statement of Particulars is dated September 16, 2016.\n[10] The Complainant\u2019s reply to Afroglobal\u2019s response to the motion is dated September 23, 2016.\nII. Parties\u2019 Positions on the Motion\n[11] The Complainant\u2019s position is that:\ni) The allegations of retaliation arise from the original complaint.\nii) The allegations of retaliation present a tenable claim.\niii) The facts relating to the alleged retaliation are known to Afroglobal.\niv) The amendment of the complaint to include retaliation serves the interests of justice and the fulsome determination of the issues and controversy between the parties.\nv) No prejudice would result in granting the relief sought.\n[12] The Commission\u2019s position is that:\ni) The Complainant\u2019s position on the motion meets all of the requirements which have been established for such amendments according to previous decisions of the Tribunal.\nii) In addition the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in First Nations Child and Caring Society of Canada et al v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2012 CHRT 24 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d) is applicable wherein at paragraph 17 thereof the Tribunal held as follows:\nFurthermore, the panel is of the view that the Respondent will not be prejudiced by the amendment as it has had ample time and will have ample opportunity to respond to the allegations of retaliation made by the Complainants. To hear both the initial complaint and the allegations of retaliation in the same proceeding, as opposed to creating an artificial separation of the allegations in multiple proceedings, is favourable to all parties and is in the interest of justice.\niii) There will be no prejudice to Afroglobal as it is well positioned to prepare its defence and argue its position because the allegations of retaliation emanate from the same factual matrix as the initial complaint and the alleged retaliatory events can be linked to the initial complaint.\n[13] Afroglobal\u2019s position is that:\ni) The issue of prejudice is the predominant factor to be considered in considering whether to allow an amendment.\nii) It will be prejudiced if the complaint is amended to include the allegations of retaliation because there is no causal link between the original complaint and the amendment alleging retaliation.\nIII. Law and Analysis\n[14] The Tribunal has the authority to amend a complaint to add an allegation of retaliation. This was affirmed by the Federal Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at paragraph 30 as follows:\nThe Tribunal enjoys considerable discretion with respect to the examination of complaints under subsections 48.9(1) and (2) and sections 49 and 50 of the Act. As for the exercise of that discretion in regard to an amendment request, Mr. Justice Robert D\u00e9cary wrote in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (C.A.), 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C.3, 1993 CanLII 2990 (F.C.A.), that \u201c[\u2026] the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice\u201d.\n(See also FNCFCS supra at para 13.)\n[15] Generally speaking, an amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the amendment sought could not possibly succeed (Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT (\u201cVirk\u201d) at para 7; see also Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Wellicome, 2015 CHRT 23 at para 4).\n[16] Further, the test to be applied in assessing if the amendment should be allowed is to determine whether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original Complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation (see FNCFCS at paras. 7 and 14; see also Virk at para 7).\n[17] The Tribunal must consider prejudice that Afroglobal could suffer in allowing the Complainant to amend her Complaint. In Virk, the Tribunal explained that it \u201cmust at all times ensure that sufficient notice is given to the respondent so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself\u201d (see Virk at para 8; see also FNCFCS at paras. 15 and 17).\n[18] In determining whether the motion to amend the Complaint should be granted, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the amendment (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 02 (\u201cBressette\u201d) at para 6). The merits of the allegations should be assessed at the hearing when the parties have full and ample opportunity to provide evidence.\n[19] Allowing an amendment for retaliation does not itself establish a contravention of the Act. In Bressette the Tribunal explained this as follows in paragraph 8:\nThis is not to say that the complainant has established that the respondent did contravene s. 14.1 of the Act. This remains to be proven by the complainant at the hearing of the complaint. All that this Tribunal has concluded is that the original complaint should be amended to add an allegation under s.14.1 of the Act.\n[20] In my opinion, the Complainant\u2019s allegations of retaliation emanate from the same factual matrix as the initial Complaint. The Complainant alleges she was verbally offered a promotion. After filing her human rights complaint with the Commission, she alleges that Afroglobal refused to offer her the promotion and in fact hired others in her place. As such, the allegations of retaliation stem from the same parties and factual matrix as the initial Complaint.\n[21] In my opinion, Afroglobal will not be prejudiced by the amendment as it will have ample time and opportunity to respond to the allegations of retaliation made by the Complainant. Afroglobal\u2019s position that there is no causal link between the original Complaint and the amendment alleging retaliation does not, for the purposes of determining this motion, answer the facts alleged by the Complainant as referred to in paragraph 20 above. Rather it is an argument on the merits which may be argued at the hearing as per the quote from the Bressette case in paragraph 19 above.\nIV. Decision and Order\n[22] For the foregoing reasons, the motion to amend the Complaint is granted.\nSigned by\nEdward P. Lustig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 2, 2016\n",

Order 15\nI. Introduction\n[1] Sixteen individuals - two Complainants [1] and fourteen non-Complainants granted Interested Party status, collectively referred to as \u201cthe Goodwin Group\u201d [2] - seek an Order from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) that they performed \u201cEligible Work\u201d under the Memorandum of Agreement of July 3, 2012 between Ruth Walden et al. and the Attorney General of Canada (\u201cMOA\u201d), and compensation (for pain and suffering, lost wages\/benefits) and other remedies (reclassification). The Employer, Employment and Social Development Canada (\u201cESDC\u201d), formerly Human Resources and Skills Development Canada and Social Development Canada, determined that their work as Vocational Rehabilitation Case Managers (\u201cVRCMs\u201d) did not qualify as Eligible Work under the MOA and accordingly, were denied any compensation.\n[2] This Ruling deals with the scope of the hearing on Eligible Work and related issues.\nII. The Main Proceeding: Walden et al. v. Attorney General\n[3] The MOA is the result of human rights complaints filed by Ruth Walden and 416 other Complainants between 2004 and 2007, challenging the classification of Medical Adjudicators (\u201cMAs\u201d), a group made up predominantly of female nurses involved in the assessment\/adjudication of applications for Canada Pension Plan (\u201cCPP\u201d) disability benefits, when compared to Medical Advisors, a group made up predominantly of male doctors working alongside the MAs. The Complainants alleged that, as a result of their classification, Medical Advisors received better compensation, benefits, training, professional recognition and opportunities for advancement than MAs despite the fact that both groups performed similar work in the assessment\/adjudication of CPP disability benefit applications.\n[4] In a decision dated December 13, 2007 (Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2007 CHRT 56 (\u201cLiability Decision\u201d)), the Tribunal found that while there were some differences in the day-to-day responsibilities of Medical Advisors and MAs, the \u201ccore function\u201d of each position was the same and both positions required the application of professional knowledge and expertise in determining applicants\u2019 eligibility for CPP disability benefits. The Tribunal concluded that the Government\u2019s refusal to recognize the professional nature of the work performed by MAs in a manner proportionate to the professional recognition awarded to the work of Medical Advisors amounted to adverse differentiation on the ground of sex and violated both sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d). This decision was upheld by the Federal Court on judicial review: Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490.\n[5] The Tribunal made a separate award on remedies in a decision dated May 25, 2009: Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2009 CHRT 16 (\u201cRemedy Decision\u201d). In this decision, the Tribunal concluded that the creation of a new Nursing (NU) Sub-Group within the SH [Health Services] Occupational Group for the Medical Adjudication position would recognize suitably MAs as health care professionals, thereby acknowledging that they apply their comprehensive knowledge of the professional specialty of nursing to their work. The Tribunal found that this would be the most appropriate way to redress the discriminatory practice identified in the Liability Decision and ordered that work on the creation of the new NU Sub-Group commence within 60 days of the date of the decision. The Tribunal did not otherwise award any compensation for wage loss and ordered compensation for pain and suffering to two individuals only.\n[6] On judicial review of the Remedy Decision (Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FC 1135), the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions regarding the creation of the new Sub-Group, but set aside the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions vis-\u00e0-vis compensation for lost wages and pain and suffering. The Court remitted both of these matters back to a new panel of the Tribunal for redetermination. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld this decision: Canada (Social Development) v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2011 FCA 202. I was assigned the matter as the new \u201cpanel\u201d by the Chair of the Tribunal in December of 2010.\n[7] Following these decisions, the Respondent created the MA NU Sub-Group as part of the Public Service Nursing Classification Standard. It is defined as: \u201cPositions responsible for determining the medical eligibility of applicants for a government program or for the provision of expert advice related to medical adjudication\u201d and includes two levels of Medical Adjudication nursing positions: the NU-EMA-01 which involves \u201cthe assessment of medical information for the purposes of determining the eligibility of applicants for a federal government program\u201d and the NU-EMA-02 which \u201caccommodates supervisory medical adjudication nursing positions or technical specialist and\/or expert positions in headquarters and\/or the Regions\u201d.\n[8] The parties also negotiated settlements on appropriate remedies to redress the discriminatory practice: first dealing with compensation for pain and suffering and expressed in an Order on consent dated October 26, 2011; then on July 3, 2012, concluding the MOA which sought to resolve all remaining issues, including lost wages\/benefits. No amendments have been made to the MOA. It is the MOA, and in particular its definition of \u201cEligible Work\u201d, that forms the subject matter of the Goodwin Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion.\n[9] The MOA awards $16,500 per year to individuals who are determined to have performed \u201cEligible Work\u201d during the \u201cEligibility Period\u201d which spans from December 1, 1999 to September 30, 2011. The MOA also provides for the payment of interest, other compensation for individuals who completed Eligible Work for periods prior to December 1, 1999, as well as additional compensation for pain and suffering as per s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA.\n[10] Eligible Work is defined under Section 1, \u201cDefinition of Terms\u201d of the MOA:\n\u201cEligible Work\u201d is defined as described in paragraph 4 of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated October 26, 2011, that is, the individual was primarily employed in the CPP Disability Program in Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) either conducting adjudications (i.e. assessing medical information for the purposes of determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits and, in doing so, was required to use knowledge associated with being a registered nurse) or providing expert advice to or directly supervising those who did conduct adjudications.\n[11] On July 31, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Consent Order implementing the terms of the MOA. The Tribunal retained full jurisdiction to deal with any dispute or controversy surrounding the meaning or interpretation of the MOA upon the application of any party or individual who may have performed Eligible Work as defined in the MOA. The Tribunal initially retained this jurisdiction until June 30, 2014, but has since extended this date to March 31, 2015, and then on consent beyond that date with respect to the issue of gross\u2013up payments only.\nIII. Background to Motion for Redetermination of Eligible Work\n[12] From 2014 to the present, the Goodwin Group filed an original disclosure motion then subsequent amended ones, seeking additional disclosure\/production, \u201cclarification\/explanation\u201d and further particulars from the Respondent. Many of the requests were opposed by the Respondent on the grounds of lack of relevance, breach of privacy rights and settlement privilege. I also note that much disclosure\/production has occurred between the parties.\n[13] At the Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) of December 15, 2014, upon hearing the submissions of the parties, I ordered that the motion be converted to an oral hearing of evidence and argument on the merits of the Eligible Work claim, as had been done in previous Eligible Work motions. [3] Many CMCCs have been held between the parties and me in order to resolve pre-hearing matters and move the matter forward. The parties filed lists of proposed witnesses and will-says. Additions, deletions and substitutions were proposed. On June 5, 2015, the Respondent sought a ruling about the scope of the hearing and specifically, challenged the Goodwin Group\u2019s intention to have twelve of its proposed witnesses summoned before the Tribunal to give testimony. As well, various adjournments and an abeyance of the matter were sought and granted by me along the way. The last submissions were filed on October 7, 2016.\n[14] Mr. Goodwin and Ms. Ladouceur represented themselves and the fourteen other individuals comprising the Goodwin Group until September 20, 2016. Their written and oral submissions are very detailed. I appreciate that they have put a lot of thought and time into them. I feel that I have a good understanding of the case from their efforts and the submissions of the other parties. [4] A mountain\u2019s worth of submissions and documents have been filed. Upon reading them and my notes of the numerous CMCCs that have been held, I have decided to issue herein my Ruling on the scope of the Eligible Work hearing with directions to the parties. My decision was informed in part by the recent arrival of Jean-Rodrigue Yoboua, Representation Officer of the Public Service Alliance of Canada\u2019s Legal Services department (and a member of the Bar) to represent the Goodwin Group. I am hopeful that this Ruling with directions regarding the scope of the Eligible Work hearing and other related matters will assist the parties in efforts to resolve the outstanding disclosure\/production and \u201cwitnesses\u201d issues. After such efforts, if there is anything remaining in contention that the parties and I believe cannot be resolved with further case management, then I will render a further Ruling.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Positions on the Instant Motion\n[15] The Goodwin Group maintains that ESDC failed to properly, fairly and consistently, interpret, apply and implement the MOA to their claims for compensation for the Eligible Work that they performed as VRCMs in the CPP Disability Program. They allege various inconsistencies in the interpretation, application and administration of the MOA to not just the Goodwin Group, but to other VRCMs and MAs performing the same work as the Goodwin Group. The Goodwin Group also argues that the Respondent has changed its positions on several key issues so as to seriously put in question its credibility in the implementation and administration of the Walden compensation regime. For example, it highlights the alleged changing of positions by the Respondent on the question of whether it erroneously paid compensation to non-Goodwin Group substantive (home-positioned) VRCMs who were performing VRCM work just like the Goodwin Group (who were not so compensated). Of any wrongly paid VRCMs, the Respondent indicated that it would seek recovery of said monies.\n[16] The Goodwin Group also states that the misapplication and implementation of the MOA illustrates not just a level of incompetence or benign error, but rather, also suggests a lack of good faith on the part of ESDC by treating the Goodwin Group (\u201cundeserving awardees\u201d) differently in a pejorative sense from the other non-Goodwin Group MAs and VRCMs who received Walden compensation (\u201cdeserving awardees\u201d, or those who were Registered Nurses who had experience as MAs). Indeed, the Goodwin Group avers that ESDC had decided on who was to receive compensation and who was not well before it negotiated the remedial aspects of the Walden human rights litigation, including the MOA. Furthermore, the Goodwin Group alleges that ESDC simply carried out its previously made decisions on who was to receive compensation even after the MOA and Consent Order were signed.\n[17] The Respondent counters that, \u201cThe issue in this motion is whether VRCM work is Eligible Work, not whether a possible error may have been made in settling with a non-party to this motion.\u201d The reference to \u201cnon-party\u201d denotes ESDC\u2019s decision to compensate and treat as Eligible Work any individuals who held substantive MA positions during the Eligibility Period under the MOA, irrespective of the actual work performed. These payments to those who held a substantive MA position but did not actually perform \u201cmedical adjudication\u2026\u201d or not \u201cproviding expert advice to\u201d and\/or \u201cdirectly supervising those who did conduct adjudications\u201d as per the MOA\u2019s Eligible Work definition, admittedly were not expressly provided for in the MOA. However, the Respondent argues that it was open to ESDC to make such payments for administrative, logistical reasons (there were approximately 850 Complainants\/non-Complainants and paper work\/documents proving the actual work performed during the entire 33-year span of the Walden Eligibility Period, (Periods 1 and 2) no longer existed for all of them. (The Goodwin Group disputes this latter assertion.)\n[18] The Respondent submits that the other issues raised by the Goodwin Group are not germane or relevant to the main issue. In addition to involving the disclosure of irrelevant information and that which would breach privacy protection and\/or settlement privilege, it would be of no probative value to the hearing, yet consume precious additional time and other resources.\n[19] To sum up: \u201cESDC submits that the Tribunal, both for its own and the parties\u2019 interest, must impose reasonable and principled parameters regarding the scope and extent of relevant evidence in this motion.\u201d\nV. Analysis: Scope of the Hearing on Eligible Work and Related Issues\nA. The Primary or Main Issue\n[20] As stated in my Reasons for Decision in the McIlroy motion-hearing on Eligible Work, supra, when determining such motions, I must look at the MOA, including the plain, ordinary meaning of the words therein, the parties\u2019 intentions, and by way of contextual analysis, the broader litigation at hand. The \u201cbroader litigation\u201d encompasses the actual Complaints filed, the Liability and Remedy Decisions (including any Implementation Decisions) of the Tribunal and any relevant findings\/comments from the Courts on judicial review\/appeal. The MOA is rooted in the gender discrimination Complaints filed by over 400 MAs and states that the MOA\u2019s aim is to \u201csettle all outstanding issues arising out of the Complaint[s]\u201d. It was not negotiated and agreed to in a vacuum. The MOA is not a free-standing agreement: it was made an Order of this Tribunal.\n[21] I cannot stress enough that we are in the end-days of the Remedial Implementation phase of Walden. The key here is to adjudge whether the sixteen members of the Goodwin Group, as VRCMs performing VR work (which they call \u201cadjudication\u201d), fall within the Eligible Work definition of the MOA and are entitled to compensation thereof and other remedies sought by them (i.e., reclassification). [5]\n[22] While the jurisdiction-retention provisions of the Consent Order that approved the MOA are broad, they cannot confer jurisdiction that does not find a basis in the CHRA. The two Consent Orders contain a preamble that acknowledges that the Complaints have been \u201csubstantiated\u201d (mirroring language from section 53 of the CHRA), per the Liability Decision. Any remedy flowing from those findings, including in the Remedy Decision itself, agreements between the parties like the MOA, or further Orders by the Tribunal, must be connected to the Liability Decision and have a nexus with the subject-matter of the Complaints. Motions like the instant one are not to be construed as simply and only an exercise of contractual interpretation.\n[23] It is important to state that the jurisdiction-retention provisions are triggered \u201con the application of any party, or Individual who may have performed Eligible Work as defined in the Agreement.\u201d They are not meant to provide for a Tribunal or party-initiated general review or inquiry into the implementation of the Walden compensation regime. Para. 4 of the Consent Order accords parties or non-party individuals the right to bring their individual respective claims for Eligible Work re-determination. The Tribunal retained jurisdiction to deal with discrete issues brought before it, such as the Goodwin Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion. [6]\n[24] Notwithstanding my comments above, of course the goal is to have a perfect implementation\/administration of the MOA and Consent Orders. The allegations and submissions of the Goodwin Group raise matters of concern that less-than-perfection has been achieved by ESDC in its implementation of Walden. That may include individuals who were erroneously paid compensation, depending on my ultimate Decision on the merits of the Goodwin Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion. The Respondent has indicated already that in such a case, it would seek recovery of said payments.\n[25] Individuals who have been paid but shouldn\u2019t have, and those who haven\u2019t been paid but should have, concerns me. It is of interest, but not of relevance to the Eligible Work motion before me. In other words, such errors (in both examples) are beyond the proper scope of the hearing into this Eligible Work motion. I say this because whether ESDC made a mistake paying non-Goodwin Group VRCMs (or MAs for that matter) does not make the work of VRCMs eligible per se under the MOA. It is somewhat akin to the proverbial \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d adage that we learned as children. Any errors made by ESDC in its implementation\/administration phase of Walden do not change or alter the duties and responsibilities of VRCMs and make their work eligible for compensation under the MOA.\n[26] The main or primary issue before me is: Did VRCMs perform Eligible Work under the MOA? The parties agree with this. The point of convergence lies in issues beyond this and the type of information to be disclosed pre-hearing and the type and nature of evidence (documentary and testimonial) to be led at the hearing.\n[27] In advancing its claim, the Goodwin Group will need to adduce evidence that shows the duties and responsibilities of VRCMs during the relevant periods (approximately 1990-2011). ESDC will do so as well. Having reviewed the voluminous submissions and documents filed by the parties and their supplementary oral submissions, I am particularly interested in hearing evidence and submissions regarding the Goodwin Group\u2019s assertion that VRCMs performed \u201cadjudicative\u201d work very similar to that of the Reassessment MAs (or \u201cRA-MAs\u201d), that there was a significant \u201coverlap\u201d and \u201cblurring\u201d of lines between their work, including that in the Regions, and there were numerous individuals who performed combined RA-MA \/ VRCM roles. In addition, ESDC allegedly treated them as part of a unified \u201cReturn-to-Work Service Delivery Model\u201d pursuant to the return-to-work \u201cContinuum process and policy\u201d, \u201cindistinguishable\u201d in terms of operational decisions and combined resources used (e.g., automated case management database system, monthly \u201cRA and RTW Report\u201d).\n[28] Given that the mostly male, doctor Medical Advisors were the comparator group in the Liability Decision and remedy must be tied or have a nexus to findings of liability, I am also interested in hearing any evidence and argument concerning what, if any, overlap there was between the duties and responsibilities of the Medical Advisors and the VRCMs.\nB. The MOA: Intent of the Parties\n[29] As I found in McIlroy, supra, part of the main or primary issue of \u201cDid VRCMs perform Eligible Work under the MOA\u201d contains a secondary concern: What did the parties to the MOA intend vis-\u00e0-vis the work of VRCMs and compensation under Walden? The Goodwin Group proposes calling Laurence Armstrong (counsel to the vast majority of Complainants and negotiator of the MOA) and Nancy Lawand to testify. The Respondent has potential witnesses that could speak to that issue as well: Mary Pichette and its counsel Lynn Marchildon. Another question remains: What did the parties to the MOA intend in extending the remedy to the two additional groups or classes of individuals, vis-\u00e0-vis the VRCMs? I add this because the Goodwin Group has also included for a couple of its members the claim that they also qualified under the second (\u201cprovided expert advice\u201d) and third (\u201cdirectly supervised\u201d) categories of the Eligible Work definition. While the vast majority of those who received compensation fall into the first category, that should not be construed as creating a hierarchy among the three constituent groups within the MOA.\nC. Credibility\n[30] The Goodwin Group seeks to adduce evidence, both through testimony and documents, that challenges the credibility of the Respondent. In particular, it challenges ESDC\u2019s inconsistent implementation of the MOA and its application to the Goodwin Group and others. This is allegedly demonstrated, for example, by the Respondent\u2019s changing of positions on the issues of the rationale or formula used for determining who received compensation and whether substantive VRCMs were erroneously paid for performing VRCM work, which the Goodwin Group argues is Eligible Work under the MOA.\n[31] The Goodwin Group will be permitted to challenge the credibility of the Respondent and its witnesses, and\/or the reliability of their evidence, on matters that are germane to the hearing. In other words, the farther astray the questioning of witnesses and the tendering of evidence goes from material issues in dispute, the less latitude will be given. The key is relevancy. The focus should remain on the central or main issue as enumerated earlier in this Ruling, including how and why ESDC made the Eligible Work determinations it did on the respective files of the sixteen members of the Goodwin Group.\nD. Iyer Letter Withdrawing Disclosure Motion\n[32] The Goodwin Group was represented briefly by Vancouver lawyer Nitya Iyer. She and Respondent counsel reached an agreement on disclosure issues outstanding at the time. In her letter dated November 21, 2014, Ms. Iyer withdrew the outstanding disclosure motion before the Tribunal on the following terms:\n1. Four letters from ESDC dated May 23, 2014, July 10, 2014, July 29, 2014, and October 31, 2014 (copies attached) will be put before the Tribunal on the Goodwin Group's Eligible Work Motion on consent and ESDC will not dispute the facts stated therein, subject to the following:\na. With respect to the letter of May 23, 2014, the Goodwin Group and ESDC agree that this letter provides background on why ESDC accepted, for the purpose of settlement, that an individual was performing Eligible Work during any period in which they occupied a substantive medical adjudicator position.\nb. With respect to the letter of July 10, 2014, if the Goodwin Group intends to rely on the statement in that letter that Ms. Ladouceur never worked in a medical adjudicator position, that ESDC be given an opportunity to review Ms. Ladouceur's submissions on this fact and correct this statement.\nc. With respect to the letter of July 29, 2014, if the Goodwin Group intends to rely on ESDC's description of who it intended to contact in response to Ms. Ladouceur's disclosure motion, that ESDC be given an opportunity to clarify how ESDC determined which individuals to contact and who it actually contacted.\n[33] During the February 8, 2016 CMCC, Mr. Goodwin, who at that time resumed as representative, along with Ms. Ladouceur, of the Goodwin Group, reiterated his Group\u2019s position that ESDC has not complied with the terms of the agreement between Ms. Iyer and Ms. Marchildon as reflected in the November 21, 2014 letter. Consequently, if the Respondent did not honour the agreement, the Goodwin Group sought to renew its disclosure motion.\n[34] Ms. Marchildon replied on March 3, 2016: \u201c\u2026a proper reading of Ms. Iyer\u2019s and my agreement confirms that the time at which ESDC is to be given the opportunity to clarify items b. and c. is at the hearing on the merits of your motion, not before. However, to address your inquiries on these points, I offered to provide you now with the clarifications and corrections ESDC may have chosen to offer at the hearing.\u201d She then proceeded to provide said information in the same letter.\n[35] The Goodwin Group disputes that the Respondent has complied with the terms of the Iyer-Marchildon agreement.\n[36] I have reviewed the November 21, 2014 letter from Ms. Iyer, along with the four constituent letters, and the written and oral submissions of the parties. I agree with the Respondent\u2019s submissions. The future rights to adjust the factual substratum as contained in the letters belonged to the Respondent, to exercise if it wished. The Goodwin Group had no right to renew the disclosure motion until such time as the Iyer-Marchildon agreement was breached. I find that it has been complied with.\n[37] The Respondent also seeks a ruling from me preventing the Goodwin Group from resurrecting part of its disclosure motion by asking the Tribunal to summon four individuals to testify on similar issues that were withdrawn by the Iyer letter. According to the Respondent, allowing the Goodwin Group to do so would constitute an abuse of process. Counsel states: \u201c\u2026it would be unfair to permit the Goodwin Group to re-litigate the issues raised in the disclosure motion by allowing them to summon witnesses to speak to facts that are no longer in contention.\u201d\n[38] The Goodwin Group retorted that said action hardly constitutes an abuse of process, as that legal term of art is known. It is not necessary that I make such a finding to dispose of this issue. I find that the terms of this procedural\/evidentiary agreement as encapsulated in the letter, have been complied with. Furthermore, the Goodwin Group was represented by counsel at the time. There is value from a public policy perspective to upholding agreements negotiated by parties through their counsel. Accordingly, the disclosure requests, as amended, by the Goodwin Group up to the November 21, 2014 withdrawal of the motion, will not be re-opened or reconsidered by me.\nE. Other Disclosure Requests\n[39] As indicated above, the Goodwin Group has added greatly to its original disclosure\/production requests. The last such requests and submissions were received on May 18, 2016. The above finding regarding the Iyer-Marchildon agreement does not dispose of the disclosure requests made subsequent to the November 21, 2014 letter. I direct the parties to communicate with each other in an effort to resolve the post-November 21, 2014 disclosure requests. They should do so having considered my comments concerning the scope of the hearing in this Ruling. Many of those disclosure requests may become moot as a result of this Ruling.\n[40] In addition, I wish to make a comment about the nature of disclosure\/production of documents under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. The disclosure\/production of documents regime under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure is more limiting than the discovery process used in the civil courts in Canada, which includes oral discovery, and in the United States, which also commonly employs written discovery or interrogatories. The Tribunal\u2019s documentary disclosure process is restricted to listing and producing arguably relevant documents related to the material facts, issues and relief as stated by the parties. [7] This forms part of the Statement of Particulars (or in this case the motion materials filed), [8] along with the identification of witnesses and a summary of their anticipated testimony (or \u201cwill-says\u201d). The purpose of disclosing particulars, \u201cwill-says\u201d and documents is to divulge the case a party intends to make at the hearing, which in turn allows each party to effectively present their respective cases at the hearing. The requesting of further documents or particulars should not be used as a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d or as an avenue to challenge the credibility of the facts and issues pled by the opposing party (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 43; and Bailie et al. v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2011 CHRT 17 at para. 15).\n[41] I make the above comment because many of the Goodwin Group\u2019s disclosure requests fall beyond the purview of the Tribunal to order in the documentary disclosure stage. Many of the requests are for Orders to require the Respondent to provide information to \u201cclarify\u201d, \u201cexplain\u201d, or \u201cspecify\u201d. For example, the Goodwin Group \u201care requesting that ESDC clarify their actions regarding the withholding of Mr. Cameron\u2019s e-mail\u2026\u201d and for ESDC \u201cto clarify\u201d the meaning of \u201cReassessments for VR\u201d. Whether such requests constitute reasonable \u201cbetter particulars\u201d I leave to the parties to negotiate after considering my comments in this Ruling on the scope of the hearing. The question for the parties is whether any information sought is necessary for the party to prepare its case before the Tribunal, avoiding any surprises that might necessitate a request for an adjournment. Otherwise, such should be left to the actual Eligible Work hearing.\nF. Application of Remedy to Non-Goodwin Group VRCMs\n[42] In his October 7, 2016 letter to the Tribunal, Mr. Yoboua wrote: \u201cThe respondent states that the Tribunal confirmed that any remedy ordered by the Tribunal will be limited to the 16 respondents [sic]; however, it is the complainants\u2019 position that this question has yet to be answered by the tribunal and is still outstanding.\u201d I have reviewed the summary letter and correspondence from the Tribunal Registry and my notes of the CMCC where it was raised and discussed. I acknowledge the statement in the March 24, 2016 letter from the Tribunal in response to one of Mr. Goodwin\u2019s written questions: \u201c\u2026should the motion be granted, any award of compensation will be limited to those members of the Goodwin Group who can establish that they performed Eligible Work.\u201d This reflected what originally appeared to be the parties\u2019 agreement on this issue at the CMCC in February 2016. However, upon further reflection of Mr. Goodwin\u2019s subsequent assertion that he \u201cfelt unprepared to be able to respond to the Member\u2019s question [during the CMCC] and was therefore both reluctant and hesitant to answer such a question without receiving legal advice on the matter\u201d, submissions on this issue will be left to the hearing on Eligible Work.\nG. Other Pre-Hearing Matters\n[43] I wish to raise two other matters with the parties. First, at some point consideration should be given to what evidence (testimony and documents) and submissions presented at the Walden hearing at the liability and remedy stages, if any, the parties wish to bring forward at the Goodwin Group\u2019s Eligible Work hearing. Second, as discussed at a previous CMCC, at the appropriate time, the parties should make best efforts to arrive at an Agreed Statement of Facts.\nVI. Order\n[44] Upon reading the written submissions and documents filed and hearing the supplementary oral submissions, I order the participating parties in this motion to communicate with each other and provide the Tribunal by January 13, 2017 with:\na. A List of what was resolved and to be approved by me, and specific matters still unresolved (e.g., relating to disclosure and witnesses) and left to be adjudicated, including Orders to be made. References to previously filed submissions are to be included;\nb. Revised Lists of Witnesses, including any newly proposed ones, and revised or new Summaries of Anticipated Testimony (\u201cwill-says\u201d); and\nc. A Chart of specific remedies sought (compensation and reclassification) and dollar amount (if available) and time-period claimed, for each of the sixteen members of the Goodwin Group, including which of the three categories of Eligible Work s\/he is claiming under the MOA.\nSigned by\nMatthew D. Garfield\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 22, 2016\n[1] Both Ms. Pick and Ms. Taylor received Walden compensation as Complainants for their work as MAs, and hence already had standing before the Tribunal. Accordingly, they are included in \u201cWalden et al.\u201d in the style of cause\/title of proceeding. They are also part of the sixteen individuals - the Goodwin Group - claiming compensation and other remedies for their work as VRCMs.\n[2] Mr. Goodwin is the Interested Party who filed the motion on June 27, 2014 on behalf of the group and represented it until September 20, 2016.\n[3] See Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2015 CHRT 15 (\u201cMcIlroy\u201d).\n[4] The Commission filed a brief concerning its general view of factors to be considered in Eligible Work motions, while not taking a position as to the merits of the Goodwin Group\u2019s claim. Its counsel indicated that the Commission would not be participating in the hearing on Eligible Work. The Commission has also filed brief submissions on other preliminary issues and participated in the numerous CMCCs held.\n[5] I note that the parties will need to make submissions at the hearing about whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction at this point to grant the reclassification remedy.\n[6] The Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to deal with disputes under the first consent Order dated October 26, 2011 pursuant to para. 8.\n[7] Rule 6(1) and 6(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. Parties also must list, but are not required to produce, any documents for which a ground of privilege is asserted.\n[8] No Statements of Particulars were filed here as this is an Eligible Work motion in the implementation phase of Walden.\n",

Acknowledgement\n[1] This decision concerns children. More precisely, it is about how the past and current child welfare practices in First Nations communities on reserves, across Canada, have impacted and continue to impact First Nations children, their families and their communities.\n[2] These proceedings included extensive evidence on the history of Indian Residential Schools and the experiences of those who attended or were affected by them. The Tribunal also heard heartfelt testimony from someone who attended and was directly impacted by attending a residential school. At the outset of these reasons, the Panel Members (the Panel) believe it important to acknowledge the suffering of all residential school survivors, their families and communities. We recognize the courage of those who have spoken about their experiences over the years and before this Tribunal. We also wish to honour the memory and lives of the many children who died, and all who were harmed, while attending these schools, along with their families and communities. We wish healing and recognition for all Aboriginal peoples across Canada for the individual and collective trauma endured as a result of the Indian Residential Schools system.\nII. Complaint and background\n[3] Child welfare services, or child and family services, are services designed to protect children and encourage family stability. The main aim of these services is to safeguard children from abuse and neglect (see Annex, ex. 1 s.v. \u201cchild welfare\u201d). Hence the best interest of the child is a paramount principle in the provision of these services and is a principle recognized in international and Canadian law. This principle is meant to guide and inform decisions that impact all children, including First Nations children.\n[4] Each province and territory has its own child and family services legislation and standards and provides those services within its jurisdiction. However, the provision of child and family services to First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon is unique and is the subject of this decision.\n[5] At issue are the activities of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), known at the time of the hearing as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), in managing the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (the FNCFS Program), its corresponding funding formulas and a handful of other related provincial and territorial agreements that provide for child and family services to First Nations living on reserve and in the Yukon Territory. Pursuant to the FNCFS Program and other agreements, child and family services are provided to First Nations on-reserve and in the Yukon by First Nations Child and Family Services Agencies (FNCFS Agencies) or by the province\/territory in which the community is located. In either situation, the child and family services legislation of the province\/territory in which the First Nation is located applies. AANDC funds the child and family services provided to First Nations by FNCFS Agencies or the province\/territory.\n[6] Pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA), the Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (the Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN), allege AANDC discriminates in providing child and family services to First Nations on reserve and in the Yukon, on the basis of race and\/or national or ethnic origin, by providing inequitable and insufficient funding for those services (the Complaint). On October 14, 2008, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) referred the Complaint to this Tribunal for an inquiry.\n[7] In a decision dated March 14, 2011 (2011 CHRT 4), the Tribunal granted a motion brought by AANDC for the dismissal of the Complaint on the ground that the issues raised were beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the jurisdictional motion). That decision was subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court of Canada.\n[8] On April 18, 2012, the Federal Court rendered its decision, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (Caring Society FC), setting aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the jurisdictional motion. The Federal Court remitted the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for redetermination in accordance with its reasons. The Respondent\u2019s appeal of that decision was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2013 FCA 75 (Caring Society FCA).\n[9] A new panel, composed of Sophie Marchildon, as Panel Chairperson, and members R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer and Edward Lustig, was appointed to re-determine this matter (see 2012 CHRT 16). It dismissed the Respondent\u2019s motion to have the jurisdictional motion re-heard, and ruled the Complaint would be dealt with on its merits (see 2012 CHRT 17).\n[10] The Complaint was subsequently amended to add allegations of retaliation (see 2012 CHRT 24). In early June 2015, the Panel found the allegations of retaliation to be substantiated in part (see 2015 CHRT 14).\n[11] The present decision deals with the merits of the Complaint. During deliberations our friend and colleague, Tribunal Member R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer, passed away. Despite his valued contributions to the hearing and consideration of this matter, he sadly was not able to see the final result of his work. While this decision is signed on behalf of the remaining Members of the Panel, we dedicate it in his honour and memory.\nIII. Parties\n[12] The Caring Society is a non-profit organization committed to research, policy development and advocacy on behalf of First Nations agencies that serve the well-being of children, youth and families. The AFN is a national advocacy organization that works on behalf of over 600 First Nations on issues such as Treaty and Aboriginal rights, education, housing, health, child welfare and social development. The Commission, in appearing before the Tribunal at a hearing, represents the public interest (see section 51 of the CHRA). AANDC is the federal government department primarily responsible for meeting the Government of Canada\u2019s obligations and commitments to Aboriginal peoples.\n[13] Additionally, two organizations were granted \u201cInterested Party\u201d status for these proceedings: Amnesty International and the Chiefs of Ontario (COO). Amnesty International is an international non-governmental organization committed to the advancement of human rights across the globe. It was granted interested party status to assist the Tribunal in understanding the relevance of Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations to the Complaint. The COO is a non-profit organization representing the 133 First Nations in the Province of Ontario. It was granted interested party status to speak to the particularities of on-reserve child welfare services in Ontario.\nIV. The hearing, disclosure and admissibility of documents\n[14] The hearing of the Complaint spanned 72 days from February 2013 to October 2014. Throughout the hearing, documentary disclosure and the admissibility of certain documents as evidence became an issue.\n[15] All arguably relevant documents were not disclosed prior to the commencement of the hearing. Despite agreeing to complete its disclosure prior to the start of the hearing, and subsequently confirming that it had, AANDC knew of the existence of a number of arguably relevant documents in the summer of 2012 and yet failed to disclose them prior to the hearing. Only after the completion of an Access to Information Act request made by the Caring Society, and shortly before the third week of hearings, did AANDC inform the parties and the Tribunal of the existence of over 50,000 additional documents and an unspecified number of emails, which were potentially relevant to the Complaint, but had yet to be disclosed. As a result, the Tribunal vacated hearing dates in June 2013, re-arranged the proceedings to hear the allegations of retaliation in July and August 2013, and, following a deadline for AANDC to complete its disclosure by August 31, 2013, resumed the hearing on the merits on dates from August 2013 to January 2014 (see 2013 CHRT 16).\n[16] Following the disclosure of over 100,000 additional documents by AANDC, the hearing resumed. However, AANDC did not complete the disclosure of all arguably relevant documents until August 2014 due to an objection under section 37(1) of the Canada Evidence Act. Specifically, certain documents were characterized as being subject to Cabinet confidence privilege. All the parties agreed to have the Clerk of the Privy Council review the documents to determine if the privilege applied. This review process was completed fairly quickly once the Clerk was provided with the documents.\n[17] An issue arose as to how the 100,000 additional documents could be admitted into evidence. The Caring Society requested an order that any additionally disclosed documents upon which it wished to rely be admitted as evidence for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not the author or recipient of the document was called as a witness, and whether or not they were put to any other witness. For reasons outlined in 2014 CHRT 2, the Panel ruled as follows:\na. Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure will continue to apply. As such, documents will continue to be admitted into evidence, on a case-by case basis, once they are introduced during the hearing and accepted by the Panel;\nb. There will be no need to call witnesses for the sole purpose of authenticating documentary evidence. Any issues raised relating to authentication will be considered by the Panel at the weighing stage;\nc. For the purposes of Rule 9(4), a document has not been fully \u201cintroduced\u201d at the hearing until counsel or a witness for the party tendering it has indicated:\ni. which portions of the document are being relied upon; and\nii. how these portions of the document relate to an issue in the case.\nd. Should a party wish to rely on evidence during its final argument that was not introduced according to the procedure above (either prior to or subsequent to this order), appropriate curative measures may be taken by the Panel, and in particular, the opposing party may be allotted additional time to adequately prepare a response, including calling additional witnesses and bringing forward additional documentary evidence, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness. This may result in an adjournment of the proceedings.\n[18] Following the completion of the hearing, further issues arose as to which documents ought to form part of the record before the Tribunal. AANDC raised concerns regarding the admissibility of documents relied on by counsel for the Complainants and Commission, but not referred to orally during the hearing. In 2015 CHRT 1, the Panel ordered:\nDocuments listed in Appendix B of the Commission\u2019s December 1, 2014 letter (including Documents Referred to Only in Final Written Submissions (which were Adopted Orally) found at page 9) will be considered as forming part of the evidentiary record. The Respondent will be granted an opportunity to respond to the Complainant\u2019s documents listed in Appendix B and supporting submissions with the exception of tab-66. Should the Respondent decide to benefit from this opportunity, the Respondent is to advise the parties and the Tribunal of its intention and form of response by no later than January 21, 2015, following which the Respondent will have until February 4, 2015 to file its response.\n[19] In response to the Panel\u2019s order, AANDC provided written representations with respect to the documents at issue. According to AANDC, the Panel should place little, if any, weight on those documents in determining the merits of the Complaint. It also provided a chart summarizing its position on each of the documents.\n[20] AANDC\u2019s submissions on the documents subject to the Panel\u2019s order in 2015 CHRT 1, along with its other submissions regarding the weight to ascribe to the evidence in this matter, have been taken into consideration by the Panel, together with the submissions of the other parties, in making the findings that follow.\nV. Analysis\n[21] As mentioned above, the present Complaint alleges the provision of child and family services in on-reserve First Nations communities and in the Yukon is discriminatory. Namely that there is inequitable and insufficient funding for those services by AANDC. In this regard, the Complainants have the burden of proof of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (see Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC) at para. 28).\n[22] In the context of this Complaint, under section 5 of the CHRA, the Complainants must demonstrate (1) that First Nations have a characteristic or characteristics protected from discrimination; (2) that they are denied services, or adversely impacted by the provision of services, by AANDC; and, (3) that the protected characteristic or characteristics are a factor in the adverse impact or denial (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33 [Moore]).\n[23] The first element is relatively simple in this case: race and national or ethnic origin are prohibited grounds of discrimination under section 3 of the CHRA. There was no dispute that First Nations possess these characteristics.\n[24] The second element requires the Complainants to establish that AANDC is actually involved in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d as contemplated by section 5 of the CHRA; and, if so, to demonstrate that First Nations are denied services or adversely impacted by AANDC\u2019s involvement in the provision of those services.\n[25] For the third element, the Complainants have to establish a connection between elements one and two. A \u201ccausal connection\u201d is not required as there may be many different reasons for a respondent\u2019s acts. That is, it is not necessary that a prohibited ground or grounds be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that a prohibited ground or grounds be one of the factors in the actions in issue (see Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.) at para. 7; and, Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39 at paras. 44-52 [Bombardier]).\n[26] In this regard, it should be kept in mind that discrimination is not usually practiced overtly or even intentionally. Consequently, direct evidence of discrimination or proof of intent is not required to establish a discriminatory practice under the CHRA (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT); and; Bombardier at paras. 40-41).\n[27] In response to the Complaint, AANDC led its own evidence and arguments to refute the Complainants\u2019 claim of discrimination. It did not raise a statutory exception under sections 15 or 16 of the CHRA. Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to consider all the evidence and argument presented by the parties to determine if the Complainants have proven the three elements of a discriminatory practice on a balance of probabilities (see Bombardier at paras. 56 and 64; see also Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 at paras. 80-90).\n[28] It is through this lens, and with these principles in mind, that the Panel examined the evidence and arguments advanced by the parties in this case. For the reasons that follow, the Panel finds AANDC is involved in the provision of child and family services to First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon; that First Nations are adversely impacted by the provision of those services by AANDC, and, in some cases, denied those services as a result of AANDC\u2019s involvement; and; that race and\/or national or ethnic origin are a factor in those adverse impacts or denial.\nA. AANDC is involved in the provision of child and family services to First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon\ni. Meaning of \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the CHRA\n[29] Section 5 of the CHRA provides:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[30] Pursuant to the wording of this section, the Complainants must establish that the actions complained of are \u201c\u2026in the provision of\u2026services\u2026customarily available to the general public\u201d. The first part of this analysis involves determining what constitutes the \u201cservice\u201d based on the facts before the Tribunal (see Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, 1996 CanLII 231 (SCC) per La Forest J. at para. 68 [Gould]). In other words, what is the \u201cbenefit\u201d or \u201cassistance\u201d being held out (see Watkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 170 at para. 31 [Watkin]; and, Gould per La Forest J. at para. 55). In making this determination, \u201c[r]egard must be had to the particular actions which are said to give rise to the alleged discrimination in order to determine if they are \u201cservices\u201d (see Watkin at para. 33). In this respect, it may be useful to inquire whether the benefit or assistance is the essential nature of the activity (see Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Pankiw, 2010 FC 555 at para. 42).\n[31] The next step requires a determination of whether the service creates a public relationship between the service provider and the service user. The fact that actions are undertaken by a public body for the public good is not determinative. In fact, no one factor is determinative. Rather, in ascertaining whether a service creates a public relationship, the Tribunal must examine all relevant factors in a contextual manner (see Gould per La Forest J. at para. 68; and, Watkin at paras. 32-33). As part of this determination, the Tribunal must decide what constitutes the \u201cpublic\u201d to which the service is being offered. A public is defined in relational as opposed to quantitative terms. That is, the public to which the service is being offered does not need to be the entire public. Rather, clients of a particular service could be a very large or very small segment of the \u201cpublic\u201d (see University of British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2 SCR 353 at pp. 374-388; and, Gould per La Forest J. at para. 68). A public relationship is created where this \u201cpublic\u201d is extended a \u201cservice\u201d by the service provider (see Gould per La Forest J. at para. 55).\nii. Evidence indicating AANDC provides a \u201cservice\u201d\n[32] Both the Commission and the Caring Society characterize the FNCFS Program, its corresponding funding formulas and the related provincial\/territorial agreements as a service provided by AANDC to First Nations children and families on reserves and in the Yukon.\n[33] On the other hand, AANDC submits that its role in the provision of child and family services to First Nations is strictly limited to funding and being accountable for the spending of those funds. According to AANDC, funding does not constitute a \u201cservice\u201d. Furthermore, AANDC argues the funding it provides is not \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d. Rather, it is provided on a government to government; or, government to agency basis.\n[34] In AANDC\u2019s view, the benefit held out as a service is the provincially mandated child welfare services provided to First Nations by the FNCFS Agencies or the provinces\/territory. AANDC does not exert control over the services and programs provided. Rather, decisions as to which services to provide, how they will be provided and whether the delivery is in compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements rests with the agencies and the provinces\/territory. In this regard, AANDC relies on NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union, 2010 SCC 45 (NIL\/TU,O), to argue that child welfare services are a matter within provincial jurisdiction and that it only became involved in First Nations child and family services as a matter of social policy under its spending power. According to AANDC, its funding does not change the provincial\/territorial nature of child and family services.\n[35] As explained in the following pages, the Panel finds AANDC is involved in the provision of child and family services to First Nations on reserves across Canada and in the Yukon. Specifically, AANDC offers the benefit or assistance of funding to \u201censure\u201d, \u201carrange\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d and\/or \u201cmake available\u201d child and family services to First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon. With specific regard to the FNCFS Program, the objective is to ensure the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services, in the best interest of the child, in accordance with the legislation and standards of the reference province\/territory, and provided in a reasonably comparable manner to those provided to other provincial\/territorial residents in similar circumstances and within FNCFS Program authorities. This benefit or assistance is held out as a service by AANDC and provided to First Nations in the context of a public relationship.\na. Jurisdiction of the CHRA over the activities of AANDC\n[36] With regard to the NIL\/TU,O decision, the question in that case was whether the labour relations of a FNCFS Agency should be regulated under provincial or federal jurisdiction. Labour relations are presumptively a provincial matter. In this regard, the Supreme Court found the NIL\/TU,O Agency was a child welfare agency regulated by the province in all aspects. Neither the fact that it received federal funding, the Aboriginal identity of its clients and employees, nor its mandate to provide culturally appropriate services to Aboriginal clients, displaced the operating presumption that labour relations are provincially regulated.\n[37] The present case raises human rights issues in the context of AANDC\u2019s activities. As opposed to labour relations matters, human rights matters are not presumptively provincial. The CHRA applies to \u201c\u2026matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament\u201d (see CHRA at s. 2). While the activities of FNCFS Agencies and provincial governments may well be within provincial jurisdiction for labour relations purposes, this does not have any bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over AANDC\u2019s activities in this case.\n[38] The Complaint is filed against, and is focused upon, the activities of AANDC. AANDC is a federal government department created by Parliament through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act. Its mandate is derived from a number of federal statutes, including the Indian Act. Therefore, any actions taken by AANDC come within the legislative authority of Parliament and could be subject to the CHRA.\n[39] The issue in this case is not whether AANDC\u2019s activities fall outside the jurisdiction of the CHRA because they do not come within the legislative authority of Parliament. Rather, it is whether the CHRA applies to AANDC\u2019s activities because its actions are in the provision of a service. The fact that other actors, including provincial actors, may be involved in the provision of the service is not determinative and does not necessarily shield AANDC from human rights scrutiny (see for example Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 SCR 624 [Eldridge]). As mentioned above, it is for the Tribunal to consider all relevant factors to determine the nature and extent of AANDC\u2019s involvement and whether that involvement rises to the status of a \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the CHRA.\nb. Funding can constitute a service\n[40] Similarly, even if AANDC\u2019s role in the child and family welfare of First Nations is limited to funding, there is nothing in the CHRA that excludes funding from the purview of section 5. That is, funding can constitute a service if the facts and evidence of the case indicate that the funding is a benefit or assistance offered to the public pursuant to the criteria outlined above.\n[41] A similar argument to the one advanced by AANDC was rejected by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal in Bitonti et al. v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia et al., (1999) 36 CHRR D\/263 (BCHRT) (Bitonti). Among other things, the complainants in that case argued that the allocation of funding provided by the Ministry of Health did not provide foreign medical school graduates with a real opportunity to obtain internships. The Ministry of Health responded that the expenditure of funds by the provincial government was a legislative act that was immune from the Tribunal\u2019s review. While the BCHRT ultimately found there was no service relationship between the Ministry of Health and the complainants, at paragraph 315 it was not prepared to accept the Ministry\u2019s argument regarding immunity for funding:\nCarried to its extreme, that position would mean, for example, that if the Ministry of Health provided funding for internships but stipulated that it would only pay male interns, that conduct would be immune from review. I am not prepared to go that far.\n[42] Similarly, in Kelso v. The Queen, [1981] 1 SCR 199 at page 207 (Kelso), the Supreme Court stated (emphasis added):\nNo one is challenging the general right of the Government to allocate resources and manpower as it sees fit. But this right is not unlimited. It must be exercised according to law. The government\u2019s right to allocate resources cannot override a statute such as the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[43] Indeed, the Supreme Court has confirmed the quasi-constitutional nature of the CHRA on many occasions (see for example Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 SCR 84 at pp. 89-90 (Robichaud); Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30 at para. 81 (Vaid); and, Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 at para. 62 [Mowat]). It expresses fundamental values and pursues fundamental goals for our society, such as the fundamental Canadian value of equality (see s. 2 of the CHRA; see also Mowat at para. 33; and, Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop, [1993] 1 SCR 554 at p. 615, per Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9). Therefore, the CHRA is to be interpreted in a broad, liberal, and purposive manner befitting of this special status (see Mowat at para. 62).\n[44] Conversely, any exemption from its provisions must be clearly stated (see Vaid at para. 81). Again, there is no indication in the CHRA or otherwise that Parliament intended to exclude funding from scrutiny under the Act, subject of course to the funding being determined to be a service. In line with Kelso, where the Government of Canada is involved in the provision of a service, including where the service involves the allocation of funding, that service and the way resources are allocated pursuant to that service must respect human rights principles.\n[45] Therefore, the Panel dismisses the argument that funding cannot constitute a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA. In any event, as will be examined in the following pages, the evidence in this case indicates the essential nature of the \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d offered by AANDC for the provision of child and family services on First Nations reserves is something more than funding.\nc. The \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d provided by AANDC\n[46] AANDC\u2019s FNCFS Program applies to FNCFS Agencies in all provinces and the Yukon Territory, except Ontario. In Ontario, AANDC has a cost-sharing agreement with the province for the provision of child and family services on First Nations reserves. AANDC also has agreements with the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia to provide child and family services to certain First Nations reserves. A similar agreement is also in place with the Yukon Territory. The provision of child and family services to First Nations in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut were not the subject of this Complaint.\n[47] The FNCFS Program were developed to address concerns over the lack of child and family services provided by the provinces to First Nations reserves. Traditionally, assistance to First Nations children and their families was provided informally, by custom, within the network of their extended family. However, over time, this informal assistance became insufficient to meet the needs of children and families living on First Nations reserves.\n[48] The Joint Committees of the Senate and the House of Commons in 1946-1948 and again in 1959-1961 urged provinces to increase their involvement in providing services to First Nations people in order to fill in the gaps resulting from disruptions to traditional patterns of community care. However, provincial governments were reluctant to provide those services for financial concerns and given federal jurisdiction over \u201cIndians, and lands reserved for Indians\u201d under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This led to disparity in the quantity and quality of services provided to First Nations children and families on reserve from province to province, where some provinces only provided services if they were compensated by the federal government or only in life-and-death situations (see Annex, ex. 2 at p. 39 [the NPR]).\n[49] In 1965, Canada entered into the agreement with the Province of Ontario to enable social services, including child and family services, to be extended to First Nations children and families on reserve. Other provinces entered into bilateral agreements whereby AANDC would reimburse them for the delivery of child and family services (see Annex, ex. 3 at ss. 1.1.2 - 1.1.3 [2005 FNCFS National Program Manual]).\n[50] In the 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s, concerns began being raised over the child and family services being provided to First Nations by the provinces. Namely, the services were minimal, not culturally appropriate and there were an alarming number of First Nations children being removed from their communities. This started a move towards the creation of community-specific FNCFS Agencies. AANDC funded these agencies through ad hoc arrangements, but authorities for doing so were unclear and funding was inconsistent (see the NPR at p. 24).\n[51] In 1986, AANDC put a moratorium on the ad hoc arrangements for the development of FNCFS Agencies. This moratorium remained in place until 1990 when AANDC implemented the FNCFS Program (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 1.1.6; and, the NPR at p. 24).\n[52] At section 1.3 of the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual, the objective and principles of the FNCFS Program are outlined and include:\n1.3.2 The primary objective of the FNCFS program is to support culturally appropriate child and family services for Indian children and families resident on reserve or Ordinarily Resident On Reserve, in the best interest of the child, in accordance with the legislation and standards of the reference province.\n[\u2026]\n1.3.4 FNCFS will be managed and operated by provincially mandated First Nations organizations (Recipients), which provide services to First Nations children and families Ordinarily Resident On Reserve. FNCFS Recipients will manage the program in accordance with provincial or territorial legislation and standards. INAC will provide funding in accordance with its authorities.\n1.3.5 The child and family services offered by FNCFS on reserve are to be culturally relevant and comparable, but not necessarily identical, to those offered by the reference province or territory to residents living off reserve in similar circumstances.\n1.3.6 Protecting children from neglect and abuse is the main objective of child and family services. FNCFS also provide services that increase the ability and capacity of First Nations families to remain together and to support the needs of First Nations children in their parental homes and communities.\n1.3.7 First Nation agencies and other Recipients will ensure that all persons Ordinarily Resident On Reserve and within their Catchment Area receive a full range of child and family services reasonably comparable to those provided off reserve by the reference province or territory. Funding will be provided in accordance with INAC authorities.\n[53] In 2012, following the filing of the Complaint, the wording of the objective of the FNCFS Program was modified, but is still similarly described as follows:\n1.1 Objective\nThe FNCFS program provides funding to assist in ensuring the safety and well-being of First Nations children ordinarily resident on reserve by supporting culturally appropriate prevention and protection services for First Nations children and families.\nThese services are to be provided in accordance with the legislation and standards of the province or territory of residence and in a manner that is reasonably comparable to those available to other provincial residents in similar circumstances within Program Authorities.\n(see Annex, ex. 4 at p. 30 [2012 National Social Programs Manual])\n[54] The other provincial and territorial agreements for the provision of child and family services in First Nations communities have a similar purpose to the FNCFS Program. In Ontario, the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians (see Annex, ex. 5 [the 1965 Agreement]), at page 1, provides:\nWHEREAS the 1963 Federal-Provincial Conference, in charting desirable long-range objectives and policies applicable to the Indian people, determined that the principal objective was the provision of provincial services and programs to Indians on the basis that needs in Indian Communities should be met according to standards applicable in other communities;\nAND WHEREAS Canada and Ontario in working towards this objective desire to make available to the Indians in the Province the full range of provincial welfare programs;\n[55] In Alberta, the Arrangement for the Funding and Administration of Social Services (see Annex, ex. 6 [the Alberta Reform Agreement]) at page 1 states:\nWHEREAS:\nCanada continues to have a special relationship with and interest in the Indian people of Canada arising from history, treaties, statutes and the Constitution;\nCanada and Alberta recognize and agree that this arrangement will not prejudice the treaty rights of Indian people, nor alter any obligations of Canada to Indian people pursuant to treaties, statutes and the Constitution, including any rights protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, nor affect any self-government rights that may be negotiated in future constitutional negotiations;\nCanada and Alberta recognize that Indians and Indian Families should be provided with Social Services which take into account their cultures, values, languages and experiences;\nCanada and Alberta are desirous of developing an arrangement in respect of the funding and administration for Social Services which would be applicable to Indians in the Province of Alberta; and\nCanada and Alberta acknowledge that Indians have aspirations towards self-government and both therefore wish to support the establishment, management, and delivery by Indians and Indian organizations of child and family services and other community-based Social Services for Indians in Alberta.\n[56] At section 3 of the Alberta Reform Agreement, Canada\u2019s role is described as:\n3. Canada will by this arrangement and in accordance with Appendix II:\n(a) arrange for the delivery of Social Services comparable to those provided by Alberta to other residents of the Province directly or through negotiated agreements with Indian Bands, Indian agencies, Indian organizations, or with Alberta, to persons ordinarily residing on a Reserve; and\n(b) fund Social Services for Indians and Indian Families ordinarily residing on a Reserve comparable to those provided by Alberta to other residents of the Province; and in particular, reimburse Alberta for those Social Services which Alberta delivers to Indians and Indian Families ordinarily residing on a Reserve.\n[57] In British Columbia, the Service Agreement Regarding the Funding of Child Protection Services of First Nations Children Ordinarily Resident on Reserve (see Annex, ex. 7 [the BC Service Agreement]), which in 2012 replaced a previous memorandum of understanding between the two parties (see Annex, ex. 8 [the BC MOU]), provides:\n1.0 Vision\nGovernments working together in British Columbia to ensure that First Nation children, youth and their families live in strong, healthy families and sustainable communities where they are connected to their culture, language and traditions.\nDIAND and MCFD will contribute to this vision through a strong focus on providing funding and effective services respectively, to achieve meaningful outcomes for vulnerable First Nations children, youth and their families ordinarily resident on reserve.\n[58] Finally, in the Yukon, there is the Funding Agreement (see Annex, ex. 9 [the Yukon Funding Agreement]). The Yukon Funding Agreement applies to all First Nations children and families ordinarily resident in the Territory. Pursuant to Schedule \u201cDIAND-3\u201d of the Yukon Funding Agreement, \u201c[t]he Territory will administer the First Nation Child and Family Services Program in accordance with DIAND\u2019s First Nation Child and Family Services Program \u2013 National Manual or any other program documentation issued by DIAND as amended from time to time\u201d.\n[59] The history and objectives of the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements indicate that the benefit or assistance provided through these activities is to \u201censure\u201d, \u201carrange\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d and\/or \u201cmake available\u201d child and family services to First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon. Without the FNCFS Program, related agreements and the funding provided through those instruments, First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon would not receive the full range of child and family services provided to other provincial\/territorial residents, let alone services that are suitable to their cultural realities. The activities of the provinces\/territory alone were insufficient to meet the child and family services needs of First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon.\n[60] Therefore, the essential nature of the FNCFS Program is to ensure First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon receive the \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d of culturally appropriate child and family services to that are reasonably comparable to the services provided to other provincial residents in similar circumstances. The other related provincial\/territorial agreements provide a similar \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d. AANDC extends this \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d to First Nations children and families on reserves and in the Yukon Territory.\nd. First Nations children and families are extended the \u201cassistance\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d by AANDC\n[61] First Nations and, in particular, First Nations on reserve, are a distinct public. AANDC extends the assistance or benefit of the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements to this public through FNCFS Agencies and\/or the provinces\/territory.\n[62] Section 1.5 of the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual defines the roles and responsibilities of AANDC\u2019s headquarters and regional offices in ensuring the safety and well-being of First Nations children ordinarily resident on reserve. At section 1.5.2, the role of Headquarters includes: \u201cto provide [\u2026] funding on behalf of children and families as authorized by the approved policy and program authorities\u201d; \u201cto lead in the development of FNCFS policy\u201d; and, \u201cto provide oversight on program issues related to the FNCFS policy and to assist regions and First Nations in finding solutions to problems arising in the regions\u201d.\n[63] The role of AANDC\u2019s regional offices is outlined at section 1.5.3 of the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual and includes: \u201cto interact with Recipients, Chiefs and Councils, Headquarters, the reference province or territory\u201d; \u201cto manage the program and funding on behalf of Canada and to ensure that authorities are followed\u201d; \u201cto assure Headquarters that the program is operating according to authorities and Canada\u2019s financial management requirements\u201d; and, \u201cto establish, in cooperation with Recipients, a process for dealing with disputes over issues relating to the operation of FNCFS\u201d.\n[64] The role of the FNCFS Agencies is, among other things, \u201cto deliver the FNCFS program in accordance with provincial legislation and standards while adhering to the terms and conditions of their funding agreements\u201d (2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at section 1.5.4). The provinces mandate, regulate and oversee the FNCFS Agencies (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at section 1.5.5).\n[65] In a more summary fashion, the 2012 National Social Programs Manual defines the differing roles of AANDC, the provinces\/territory and the FNCFS Agencies as follows, at page 30:\n1.2 Provincial Delegations\nChild welfare is an area of provincial responsibility whereby each province, in accordance with their legislation, delegates authority to FNCFS agencies to manage and deliver child welfare services on reserve.\nThe FNCFS agencies, delegated by the province, provide protection services to eligible First Nation children, ordinarily resident on-reserve in accordance with provincial legislation and standards.\nThe Program funds FNCFS agencies to deliver protection (out of the home) and prevention services (in-home) to First Nation children, youth, and families ordinarily resident on reserve.\n[66] AANDC has a \u201cShared Responsibility for Child Welfare\u201d with the FNCFS Agencies and the provinces\/territory (see the NPR at p.88). It not only provides funding, but policy and oversight as well. It works as a partner with the FNCFS Agencies and provinces\/territory to deliver adequate child and family services to First Nations on reserves. It is not a passive player in this partnership, whereby it only provides funding: it strives to improve outcomes for First Nations children and families. In this regard, Ms. Sheilagh Murphy, Director General of the Social Policy and Programs Branch of AANDC, testified about the goal of AANDC social programs:\nWell, I mean we have this broad objective or goal to make sure that First Nations on Reserve -- men, women, and children -- are safe, that they are healthy and that they have the means to become productive members of their communities and can contribute to those communities and to Canada more generally as citizens.\n(StenoTran Services Inc.\u2019s transcript of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada) (CHRT), Ottawa, Vol. 54 at pp. 17-18 [Transcript])\n[67] The FNCFS Program is one of the social programs meant to achieve this objective. A \u201cFact Sheet\u201d developed in October 2006 and previously posted on AANDC\u2019s website (see Annex, ex. 10 [Fact Sheet]), demonstrates how the department previously held out the FNCFS Program:\nThe First Nations Child and Family Services Program is one component of a suite of Social Programs that addresses the well-being of children and families. The main objective of the Program is to assist First Nations in providing access to culturally sensitive child and family services in their communities, and to ensure that the services provided to them are comparable to those available to other provincial residents in similar circumstances.\n[68] AANDC works directly with its partners, including First Nations, to ensure the objectives of the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements are being met. The 2005 FNCFS Program Manual provides for consultation among AANDC and First Nations communities with regard to disputes over the program (see ss. 1.5.2-1.5.3). The Alberta Reform Agreement specifically provides for consultation with First Nations communities in reviewing the effectiveness of the arrangement (see ss. 13-14). Similarly, the agreements in British Columbia and the Yukon provide for evaluation and review by AANDC of the effectiveness of the programs, services and activities it funds (see ss. 9.2 and 10.1 of the BC Service Agreement; and, s. 13.4.1 of the Yukon Funding Agreement).\n[69] In its previous website Fact Sheet, AANDC held out this partnership as follows:\nThe Government of Canada is committed to working with First Nations, provincial\/territorial, and federal partners and agencies to implement a modernized vision of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program, a program that strives for safe and strong children and youth supported by healthy parents.\n[70] Ms. Murphy provided some insight into the nature of AANDC\u2019s role and partnership in ensuring adequate child and family services to First Nations reserves:\nI mean, we continue to be a funder, we don't espouse to be experts in the area of child welfare practice. I mean, our role I think has changed in some ways in that when you look at the progression of this program -- we do audits and we do evaluations, the Auditor General looked at this program in 2008 and again in 2011. We do need to have \u2013 we don't just want to be writing cheques, we actually do have a genuine interest in making sure that First Nation Agencies are delivering the program according to the legislation and regulation, that they have the capacity to do that, that we are getting to outcomes.\nSo we are not a passive player in terms of being interested in how First -- I mean, it's program risk management, it is financial risk management, to make sure that they are delivering the program that is within the authorities, that they are paying for the right things that we have been given the money for.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 51-52)\n[71] As the above indicates, AANDC plays a significant role in the effort to improve outcomes for First Nations children and families residing on reserve. While AANDC argues that it does not control services, the manner and extent of AANDC\u2019s funding significantly shapes the child and family services provided by the FNCFS Agencies and\/or the provinces\/territory. This will be further elaborated upon in section B of this Analysis below. For the purposes of this \u201cservice\u201d analysis, suffice it to say AANDC\u2019s involvement in the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements determines whether and to what extent child and family services are provided to First Nations reserves and in the Yukon.\n[72] For example, a document entitled First Nations Child and Family Services British Columbia Transition Plan (Decision by Assistant Deputy Minister \u2013 ESDPP) authored by three AANDC employees and signed by the Assistant Deputy Minister at the time, Ms. Christine Cram (see Annex, ex. 11), at page 2, explains the ultimate consequence that AANDC\u2019s funding can have on FNCFS Agencies:\nFor the majority of these FNCFS agencies, a permanent reduction of unexpended maintenance balances and the absence of additional resources for operations on a go forward basis will render them financially unviable and will likely result in many agency closures.\n[73] It is AANDC that created the FNCFS Program and its corresponding funding formulas, and who negotiated and administers the provincial\/territorial agreements. While the FNCFS Program is set up to work in a tripartite fashion, and the other agreements in a bilateral fashion, at the end of the day it is AANDC\u2019s involvement that is needed to improve outcomes for First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon. AANDC holds a considerable degree of control in this regard. Again, this will be elaborated upon in section B of this Analysis. However, by way of example, in a document entitled Reform of the FNCFS Program in Qu\u00e9bec (Information for the Deputy Minister), at pages 1-3 (see Annex, ex. 12), two AANDC employees explain the Department\u2019s decision not to transition Qu\u00e9bec to a new funding methodology:\nINAC has been in discussion with the First Nations of Qu\u00e9bec and Labrador Health and Social Services Commission (Commission) and Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Ministry of Health and Social Services since June, 2007 regarding transitioning the Quebec FNCFS Agencies to an enhanced prevention approach.\nThe three parties have developed a Partnership for Results Framework that outlines the strategic direction, key outcomes and performance indicators for FNCFS on reserve in Qu\u00e9bec. Both the First Nations leadership and the Province have submitted letters of endorsement for this initiative.\nIn November of 2007, a number of issues were raised by the First Nations of Qu\u00e9bec and Labrador Health and Social Services Commission. The issues largely pertain to the overall funding formula that was proposed as a model for the Qu\u00e9bec First Nations agencies (See Annex A for detailed list of concerns and our proposed action).\nA decision was made in December 2007, to move forward in the transition to the enhanced prevention focused approach without Qu\u00e9bec in order to give the Department time to address First Nations\u2019 concerns with the transition process.\nThe Department has not yet informed Qu\u00e9bec First Nations and the Province of Qu\u00e9bec of the decision to delay the transition to the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach in Qu\u00e9bec.\n[\u2026]\nThere is a risk that once the Commission and Qu\u00e9bec First Nations are informed of the decision that was made; they will not want to proceed with the transition to the new enhanced prevention-focused approach. It is hoped that the delivery of messaging from a senior official will reassure the First Nations of the Department\u2019s commitment and enable the working level to address concerns raised and move the transition forward.\n[74] This document is an official position to be adopted by AANDC\u2019s Deputy Minister, informed by high level AANDC employees. It illustrates that, despite a tripartite relationship where its partners support a new funding approach, AANDC is the one who controls the process and makes the final decision in determining the approach to be taken.\n[75] Furthermore, AANDC has the power to withhold funds if FNCFS Agencies and\/or the provinces\/territory do not comply with its funding requirements. This could result in agencies closing their doors and, as a consequence, inadequate child and family services being provided to First Nations children and families on reserves and in the Yukon (see testimony of William McArthur, Manager, Social Programs, British Columbia Regional Office, AANDC, Transcript Vol. 64 at pp. 45-47).\n[76] All the above indicates a public relationship between AANDC and First Nations children and families in the provision of child and family services. In sum, AANDC extends the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements as a partnership, including with First Nations, to improve outcomes for First Nations children and families on reserve. Ultimately, through the FNCFS Program, its funding formulas and the related provincial\/territorial agreements, AANDC has a direct impact on the child and family services provided to First Nations children and families living on reserves and in the Yukon Territory.\n[77] This public relationship between AANDC and First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon in the provision of child and family services is reinforced by the federal government\u2019s constitutional responsibilities and its special relationship with Aboriginal peoples.\ne. Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867\n[78] The fact that AANDC does not directly deliver First Nations child and family services on reserve, but funds the delivery of those services through FNCFS Agencies or the provincial\/territorial governments, does not exempt it from its public mandate and responsibilities to First Nations people. AANDC argues that child welfare services fall within provincial jurisdiction and that it only became involved as a matter of social policy to address concerns that the provinces were not providing the full range of services to First Nations children and families living on reserves. However, that position does not take into consideration Parliament\u2019s exclusive legislative authority over \u201cIndians, and lands reserved for Indians\u201d by virtue of section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[79] In Canada, legislative power is divided between the federal government and the provincial\/territorial governments. As stated by the Supreme Court in Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22 at paragraph 22 (Central Western Bank):\n\u2026federalism was the legal response of the framers of the Constitution to the political and cultural realities that existed at Confederation. It thus represented a legal recognition of the diversity of the original members. The division of powers, one of the basic components of federalism, was designed to uphold this diversity within a single nation. Broad powers were conferred on provincial legislatures, while at the same time Canada\u2019s unity was ensured by reserving to Parliament powers better exercised in relation to the country as a whole. Each head of power was assigned to the level of government best placed to exercise the power. The fundamental objectives of federalism were, and still are, to reconcile unity with diversity, promote democratic participation by reserving meaningful powers to the local or regional level and to foster co\u2011operation among governments and legislatures for the common good.\n[80] The Supreme Court also noted that \u201cthe interpretation of these powers and of how they interrelate must evolve and must be tailored to the changing political and cultural realities of Canadian society\u201d (Central Western Bank at para. 23). This is referred to as the \u201cliving tree\u201d doctrine.\n[81] The legislative powers defined in the Constitution Act, 1867 are deemed to be exclusive to the extent that, even if Parliament does not legislate in its fields of jurisdiction, the provinces\/territories are not allowed to do so (see Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580 (P.C.) at p. 588). However, the Court has indicated clearly that this doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity is to be construed narrowly, among other reasons, so as not to allow any legal vacuum. It is used \u201c\u2026to protect that which makes certain works or undertakings, things (e.g., Aboriginal lands) or persons (e.g., Aboriginal peoples and corporations created by the federal Crown) specifically of federal jurisdiction\u201d (Central Western Bank at para. 41). As also noted in Central Western Bank at paragraph 42:\nCanadian federalism is not simply a matter of legalisms. The Constitution, though a legal document, serves as a framework for life and for political action within a federal state, in which the courts have rightly observed the importance of co-operation among government actors to ensure that federalism operates flexibly.\n[82] Despite the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity, cooperative federalism can exist in situations where federal and provincial authorities connect. In the recent case of Quebec (A.G.) v. Canada (A.G.), 2015 SCC 14 (Canadian Firearms Registry), where Quebec challenged the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s decision to destroy the firearms registry, the Supreme Court found itself divided on the scope of cooperative federalism. Nonetheless, the majority in Canadian Firearms Registry held that cooperative federalism cannot override or modify the constitutional division of powers:\n[17] Cooperative federalism is a concept used to describe the \u201cnetwork of relationships between the executives of the central and regional governments [through which] mechanisms are developed, especially fiscal mechanisms, which allow a continuous redistribution of powers and resources without recourse to the courts or the amending process [\u2026] From this descriptive concept of cooperative federalism, courts have developed a legal principle that has been invoked to provide flexibility in separation of powers doctrines, such as federal paramountcy and interjurisdictional immunity. It is used to facilitate interlocking federal and provincial legislative schemes and to avoid unnecessary constraints on provincial legislative action [\u2026] With respect to interjurisdictional immunity, for example, the principle of cooperative federalism has been relied on to explain and justify relaxing a rigid, watertight compartments approach to the division of legislative power that unnecessarily constrains legislative action by the other order of government: \u201cIn the absence of conflicting enactments of the other level of government, the Court should avoid blocking the application of measures which are taken to be enacted in furtherance of the public interest\u201d (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 37).\n[18] However, we must also recognize the limits of the principle of cooperative federalism. The primacy of our written Constitution remains one of the fundamental tenets of our constitutional framework: Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 53. This is especially the case with regard to the division of powers:\n. . . the text of the federal constitution as authoritatively interpreted in the courts remains very important. It tells us who can act in any event. In other words, constitutionally it must always be possible in a federal country to ask and answer the question \u2014 What happens if the federal and provincial governments do not agree about a particular measure of co-operative action? Then which government and legislative body has power to do what?\n(Emphasis added; footnote omitted)\n[83] Instead of legislating in the area of child welfare on First Nations reserves, pursuant to Parliament\u2019s exclusive legislative authority over \u201cIndians, and lands reserved for Indians\u201d by virtue of section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal government took a programing and funding approach to the issue. It provided for the application of provincial child welfare legislation and standards for First Nations on reserves through the enactment of section 88 of the Indian Act. However, this delegation and programing\/funding approach does not diminish AANDC\u2019s constitutional responsibilities. In a comparable situation argued under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter), the Supreme Court stated in Eldridge at paragraph 42:\n\u2026the Charter applies to private entities in so far as they act in furtherance of a specific governmental program or policy. In these circumstances, while it is a private actor that actually implements the program, it is government that retains responsibility for it. The rationale for this principle is readily apparent. Just as governments are not permitted to escape Charter scrutiny by entering into commercial contracts or other \u201cprivate\u201d arrangements, they should not be allowed to evade their constitutional responsibilities by delegating the implementation of their policies and programs to private entities.\n[84] Similarly, AANDC should not be allowed to evade its responsibilities to First Nations children and families residing on reserve by delegating the implementation of child and family services to FNCFS Agencies or the provinces\/territory. AANDC should not be allowed to escape the scrutiny of the CHRA because it does not directly deliver child and family services on reserve.\n[85] As explained above, despite not actually delivering the service, AANDC exerts a significant amount of influence over the provision of those services. Ultimately, it is AANDC that has the power to remedy inadequacies with the provision of child and family services and improve outcomes for children and families residing on First Nations reserves and in the Yukon. This is the assistance or benefit AANDC holds out and intends to provide to First Nations children and families.\n[86] Parliament\u2019s constitutional responsibility towards Aboriginal peoples, in a situation where a federal department dedicated to Aboriginal affairs oversees a social program and negotiates and administers agreements for the benefit of First Nations children and families, reinforces the public relationship between AANDC and First Nations in the provision of the FNCFS Program and the related provincial\/territorial agreements.\nf. The Crown\u2019s fiduciary relationship with Aboriginal peoples\n[87] Furthermore, AANDC\u2019s commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of children and families living on reserves and in Yukon must be considered in the context of the special relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples.\n[88] The Complainants submit that the relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples is a fiduciary relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty in relation to the FNCFS Program. While AANDC acknowledges there is a general fiduciary relationship between the federal Crown and the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, it argues that fiduciary duty principles are not applicable to the Complaint.\n[89] It is well established that in all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, the Crown must act honourably (see Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, at para. 16 [Haida Nation]). It is also well established that there exists a special relationship between the Crown and the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, qualified as a sui generis relationship. This special relationship stems from the fact that Aboriginal peoples were already here when the Europeans arrived in North America (see R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 SCR 507, at para. 30).\n[90] In 1950, in a case about the application of section 51 of the Indian Act, 1906 and concerning reserve lands, the Supreme Court stated that the care and welfare of First Nations people are a \u201cpolitical trust of the highest obligation\u201d:\nThe language of the statute embodies the accepted view that these aborigenes are, in effect, wards of the State, whose care and welfare are a political trust of the highest obligation. For that reason, every such dealing with their privileges must bear the imprint of governmental approval, and it would be beyond the power of the Governor in Council to transfer that responsibility to the Superintendent General.\n(St. Ann's Island Shooting And Fishing Club v. The King, [1950] SCR 211 at p. 219 [per Rand J.])\n[91] However, this \u201cpolitical trust\u201d was not enforceable by the courts. This changed when the Supreme Court moved away from the political trust doctrine. In the context of a case dealing with the sale of surrendered land at conditions quite different from those agreed to at the time of the surrender, the Supreme Court qualified the relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples as a fiduciary relationship in Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 SCR.335, at page 376 (Guerin):\nThe fiduciary relationship between the Crown and the Indians has its roots in the concept of aboriginal, native or Indian title. The fact that Indian Bands have a certain interest in lands does not, however, in itself give rise to a fiduciary relationship between the Indians and the Crown. The conclusion that the Crown is a fiduciary depends upon the further proposition that the Indian interest in the land is inalienable except upon surrender to the Crown.\n[92] This special relationship is also rooted in the large degree of discretionary control assumed by the Crown over the lives and interests of Aboriginal peoples in Canada:\nEnglish law, which ultimately came to govern aboriginal rights, accepted that the aboriginal peoples possessed pre-existing laws and interests, and recognized their continuance in the absence of extinguishment, by cession, conquest, or legislation: see, e.g., the Royal Proclamation of 1763, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1, and R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at p. 1103. At the same time, however, the Crown asserted that sovereignty over the land, and ownership of its underlying title, vested in the Crown: Sparrow, supra. With this assertion arose an obligation to treat aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and to protect them from exploitation, a duty characterized as \u201cfiduciary\u201d in Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335.\n(Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33, at para. 9)\n[93] After the entry into force of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 SCR 1075, at page 1108, the Supreme Court further confirmed and defined the duty of the Crown to act in a fiduciary capacity as the \u201cgeneral guiding principle\u201d for section 35:\nIn our opinion, Guerin, together with R. v. Taylor and Williams (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 360, ground a general guiding principle for s. 35(1). That is, the Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to aboriginal peoples. The relationship between the Government and aboriginals is trust\u2011like, rather than adversarial and, contemporary recognition and affirmation of aboriginal rights must be defined in light of this historic relationship.\n[94] This general guiding principle is not limited to section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, but has broader application as confirmed by the Supreme Court in Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, at paragraph 79 (Wewaykum).\n[95] First Nations children and families on reserves are in a fiduciary relationship with AANDC. In the provision of the FNCFS Program, its corresponding funding formulas and the other related provincial\/territorial agreements, \u201cthe degree of economic, social and proprietary control and discretion asserted by the Crown\u201d leaves First Nations children and families \u201c\u2026vulnerable to the risks of government misconduct or ineptitude\u201d (Wewaykum at para. 80). This fiduciary relationship must form part of the context of the Panel\u2019s analysis, along with the corollary principle that in all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, the honour of the Crown is always at stake. As affirmed by the Supreme Court in Haida Nation, at paragraph 17:\nNothing less is required if we are to achieve \u201cthe reconciliation of the pre-existence of aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the Crown\u201d: Delgamuukw, supra, at para. 186, quoting Van der Peet, supra, at para. 31.\n[96] That being said, it is also well established that this fiduciary relationship does not always give rise to fiduciary obligations. While the fiduciary relationship may be described as general in nature, requiring that the Crown act in the best interest of Aboriginal peoples, fiduciary obligations are specific, related to precise aboriginal interests:\nThis sui generis relationship had its positive aspects in protecting the interests of aboriginal peoples historically [\u2026]\nBut there are limits. The appellants seemed at times to invoke the \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d as a source of plenary Crown liability covering all aspects of the Crown-Indian band relationship. This overshoots the mark. The fiduciary duty imposed on the Crown does not exist at large but in relation to specific Indian interests.\n(Wewaykum at paras. 80-81)\n[97] The Supreme Court has relied on private law concepts to define circumstances that can give rise to a fiduciary obligation because, although the Crown\u2019s obligation is not a private law duty, it is nonetheless in the nature of a private duty, susceptible of giving rise to enforceable obligations :\nIt should be noted that fiduciary duties generally arise only with regard to obligations originating in a private law context. Public law duties, the performance of which requires the exercise of discretion, do not typically give rise to a fiduciary relationship. As the \"political trust\" cases indicate, the Crown is not normally viewed as a fiduciary in the exercise of its legislative or administrative function. The mere fact, however, that it is the Crown which is obligated to act on the Indians' behalf does not of itself remove the Crown's obligation from the scope of the fiduciary principle. As was pointed out earlier, the Indians' interest in land is an independent legal interest. It is not a creation of either the legislative or executive branches of government. The Crown's obligation to the Indians with respect to that interest is therefore not a public law duty. While it is not a private law duty in the strict sense either, it is nonetheless in the nature of a private law duty. Therefore, in this sui generis relationship, it is not improper to regard the Crown as a fiduciary.\n(Guerin at p. 385)\n[98] Guerin stands for the principle that a fiduciary obligation on the Crown towards Aboriginal peoples arises from the fact that their interest in land is inalienable except upon surrender to the Crown. In another case where the Supreme Court found that the Crown has a fiduciary obligation to prevent exploitative bargains in the context of a surrender of reserve land, in Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), [1995] 4 SCR 344 at paragraph 38, it referred to private law criteria to define a situation that could give rise to a fiduciary obligation:\nGenerally speaking, a fiduciary obligation arises where one person possesses unilateral power or discretion on a matter affecting a second \"peculiarly vulnerable\" person: see Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99; Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226; and Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377. The vulnerable party is in the power of the party possessing the power or discretion, who is in turn obligated to exercise that power or discretion solely for the benefit of the vulnerable party. A person cedes (or more often finds himself in the situation where someone else has ceded for him) his power over a matter to another person. The person who has ceded power trusts the person to whom power is ceded to exercise the power with loyalty and care. This is the notion at the heart of the fiduciary obligation.\n[99] The present case does not raise land related issues. The Panel is aware that fiduciary obligations have yet to be recognized by the Supreme Court in relation to Aboriginal interests other than land outside the framework of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 (see Wewaykum at para. 81). However, the Panel is also aware that in Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 SCR 99, at paragraph 60, Wilson J. held that fiduciary duties did not apply only to legal and economic interests but could extend to human and personal interests:\nTo deny relief because of the nature of the interest involved, to afford protection to material interests but not to human and personal interests would, it seems to me, be arbitrary in the extreme.\n[100] In fact, in Wewaykum the Supreme Court noted that since the Guerin case the existence of a fiduciary obligation has been argued in a number of cases raising a variety of issues (see at para. 82). While it did not comment on these cases, the Court in Wewaykum, at paragraph 83, did state that a case by case approach would have to focus on the specific interest at issue and whether or not the Crown had assumed discretionary control giving rise to a fiduciary obligation:\nI think it desirable for the Court to affirm the principle, already mentioned, that not all obligations existing between the parties to a fiduciary relationship are themselves fiduciary in nature [\u2026], and that this principle applies to the relationship between the Crown and aboriginal peoples. It is necessary, then, to focus on the particular obligation or interest that is the subject matter of the particular dispute and whether or not the Crown had assumed discretionary control in relation thereto sufficient to ground a fiduciary obligation.\n[101] Recent case law from the Supreme Court confirms that a fiduciary obligation may also arise from an undertaking. The following conditions are to be met:\nIn summary, for an ad hoc fiduciary duty to arise, the claimant must show, in addition to the vulnerability arising from the relationship as described by Wilson J. in Frame: (1) an undertaking by the alleged fiduciary to act in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary or beneficiaries; (2) a defined person or class of persons vulnerable to a fiduciary\u2019s control (the beneficiary or beneficiaries); and (3) a legal or substantial practical interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries that stands to be adversely affected by the alleged fiduciary\u2019s exercise of discretion or control.\n(Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, at para. 36 (Elder Advocates Society); see also Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, at para. 50 [Manitoba Metis Federation])\n[102] AANDC argues that there must be an undertaking of loyalty by the Crown to the point of forsaking the interests of all others in favour of those of the beneficiaries for a fiduciary obligation to apply (see Elder Advocates Society at para. 31; and, Manitoba Metis Federation at para. 61).\n[103] However, in Elder Advocates Society, at paragraph 48, it should be noted that the Supreme Court held that the necessary undertaking was met with respect to Aboriginal peoples:\nIn sum, while it is not impossible to meet the requirement of an undertaking by a government actor, it will be rare. The necessary undertaking is met with respect to Aboriginal peoples by clear government commitments from the Royal Proclamation of 1763 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1) to the Constitution Act, 1982 and considerations akin to those found in the private sphere.\n[104] In view of the above and the evidence presented on this issue, the relationship between the federal government and First Nations people for the provision of child and family services on reserve could give rise to a fiduciary obligation on the part of the Crown. Arguably the three criteria outlined in Elder Advocates Society have been met in this case.\n[105] The FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements were undertaken and are controlled by the Crown. This undertaking is explicitly intended to be in the best interests of the First Nations beneficiaries, including that the \"best interests of the child\u201d and the safety and well-being of First Nations children are objectives of the program. The Crown has discretionary control over the FNCFS Program through policy and other administrative directives. It also exercises discretionary control over the application of the other related provincial\/territorial agreements as First Nations are not party to their negotiation. The FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements also have a direct impact on a vulnerable category of people: First Nations children and families in need of child and family support services on reserve.\n[106] The legal and substantial practical interests of First Nations children, families, and communities stand to be adversely affected by AANDC's discretion and control over the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements. The Panel agrees with the AFN, Caring Society and the COO that the specific Aboriginal interests that stand to be adversely affected in this case are, namely, indigenous cultures and languages and their transmission from one generation to the other. Those interests are also protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The transmission of indigenous languages and cultures is a generic Aboriginal right possessed by all First Nations children and their families. Indeed, the Supreme Court highlighted the importance of cultural transmission in R. v. C\u00f4t\u00e9, [1996] 3 SCR 139 at paragraph 56:\nIn the aboriginal tradition, societal practices and customs are passed from one generation to the next by means of oral description and actual demonstration. As such, to ensure the continuity of aboriginal practices, customs and traditions, a substantive aboriginal right will normally include the incidental right to teach such a practice, custom and tradition to a younger generation.\n[107] Similarly, in Doucet\u2011Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62 at paragraph 26 (Doucet-Boudreau), the Supreme Court stated the following with regard to the relation between language and culture:\nThis Court has, on a number of occasions, observed the close link between language and culture. In Mahe, at p. 362, Dickson C.J. stated:\n. . . any broad guarantee of language rights, especially in the context of education, cannot be separated from a concern for the culture associated with the language. Language is more than a mere means of communication, it is part and parcel of the identity and culture of the people speaking it. It is the means by which individuals understand themselves and the world around them.\n[108] In certifying a class action based on the operation of the child welfare system on reserve in Ontario, Justice Belobaba on the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in Brown v. Canada (AG), 2013 ONSC 5637 at paragraph 44, expressed his views on the existence of a fiduciary duty based on the discretionary Crown control over Aboriginal interests in culture:\nit is at least arguable that a fiduciary duty arose on the facts herein for these reasons: (i) the Federal Crown exercised or assumed discretionary control over a specific aboriginal interest (i.e. culture and identity) by entering into the 1965 Agreement; (ii) without taking any steps to protect the culture and identity of the on-reserve children; (iii) who under federal common law were \u201cwards of the state whose care and welfare are a political trust of the highest obligation\u201d; and (iv) who were potentially being exposed to a provincial child welfare regime that could place them in non-aboriginal homes.\n[109] The Panel agrees with the Caring Society that it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to further define the contours of Aboriginal rights in language and culture or a fiduciary duty related thereto. It is enough to say that, by virtue of being protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 indigenous cultures and languages must be considered as \u201cspecific indigenous interests\u201d which may trigger a fiduciary duty. Accordingly, where the government exercises its discretion in a way that disregards indigenous cultures and languages and hampers their transmission, it can breach its fiduciary duty. However, such a finding is not necessary to make a determination regarding whether or not AANDC provides a service; or, more broadly, to determine whether there has been a discriminatory practice under the CHRA.\n[110] Suffice it to say, AANDC\u2019s development of the FNCFS Program and related agreements, along with its public statements thereon, indicate an undertaking on the part of the Crown to act in the best interests of First Nations children and families to ensure the provision of adequate and culturally appropriate child welfare services on reserve and in the Yukon. Whether or not that gives rise to a fiduciary obligation, the existence of the fiduciary relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples is a general guiding principle for the analysis of any government action concerning Aboriginal peoples. In the current \u201cservices\u201d analysis under the CHRA, it informs and reinforces the public nature of the relationship between AANDC and First Nations on reserves and in the Yukon in the provision of the FNCFS Program and other provincial\/territorial agreements.\niii. Summary of findings\n[111] Overall, the Panel finds the evidence indicates the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements are held out by AANDC as assistance or a benefit that it provides to First Nations people. The FNCFS Program and other provincial\/territorial agreements were created and negotiated on behalf of First Nations by AANDC, a federal government department with the mandate and mission to do so. First Nations are a distinct public, served by AANDC in the context of a unique constitutional and fiduciary relationship. AANDC has undertaken to ensure First Nations living on reserve receive culturally appropriate child and family services that are reasonably comparable to the services provided to other provincial residents in similar circumstances. Therefore, the Panel finds there is a clear public nature and relationship with First Nations in AANDC\u2019s provision of the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements.\n[112] This finding is similar to the one made by the Federal Court in Attawapiskat First Nation v. Canada, 2012 FC 948. In discussing the nature of funding agreements similar to the ones at issue in the present Complaint, the Federal Court stated at paragraph 59:\nthe [Attawapiskat First Nation] relies on funding from the government through the [Comprehensive Funding Agreement] to provide essential services to its members and as a result, the [Comprehensive Funding Agreement] is essentially an adhesion contract imposed on the [Attawapiskat First Nation] as a condition of receiving funding despite the fact that the [Attawapiskat First Nation] consents to the [Comprehensive Funding Agreement]. There is no evidence of real negotiation. The power imbalance between government and this band dependent for its sustenance on the [Comprehensive Funding Agreement] confirms the public nature and adhesion quality of the [Comprehensive Funding Agreement].\n[113] As a result, and for the reasons above, the Panel finds AANDC provides a service through the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements. In the following pages, the Panel will examine the impacts of AANDC\u2019s service and, specifically, how AANDC\u2019s method of funding the FNCFS Program and related provincial\/territorial agreements significantly controls the provision of First Nations children and family services on reserve and in the Yukon to the detriment of First Nations children and families.\nB. First Nations are adversely impacted by the services provided by AANDC and, in some cases, denied services as a result of AANDC\u2019s involvement\n[114] Before dealing with how the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements are funded, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of how child welfare services are provided in Canada. Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the Caring Society, provided helpful testimony in this regard (see Transcript Vol. 1 at pp. 110, 112, 124-129, 132-136, 138-142 and 151; see also Annex, ex. 1).\ni. General child welfare principles\n[115] As indicated earlier, child welfare in Canada includes a range of services designed to protect children from abuse and neglect and to support families so that they can stay together. The main objective of social workers is to do all they can to keep children safely within their homes and communities. There are two major streams of child welfare services: prevention and protection.\n[116] Prevention services are divided into three main categories: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary prevention services are aimed at the community as a whole. They include the ongoing promotion of public awareness and education on the healthy family and how to prevent or respond to child maltreatment. Secondary prevention services are triggered when concerns begin to arise and early intervention could help avoid a crisis. Tertiary prevention services target specific families when a crisis or risks to a child have been identified. As opposed to separating a child from his or her family, tertiary prevention services are designed to be \u201cleast disruptive measures\u201d that try and mitigate the risks of separating a child from his or her family. Early interventions to provide family support can be quite successful in keeping children safely within their family environment, and provincial legislation requires that least disruptive measures be exhausted before a child is placed in care.\n[117] Protection services are triggered when the safety or the well-being of a child is considered to be compromised. If the child cannot live safely in the family home while measures are taken with the family to remedy the situation, child welfare workers will make arrangements for temporary or permanent placement of the child in another home where he or she can be cared for. This is called placing the child \u201cin care\u201d. The first choice for a caregiver in this situation would usually be a kin connection or a foster family. Kinship care includes children placed out-of-home in the care of the extended family, individuals emotionally connected to the child, or in a family of a similar religious or ethno-cultural background.\n[118] The child welfare system is typically called into action when someone has concerns about the safety or well-being of a child and reports these concerns to a social worker. The first step is for the social worker to do a preliminary assessment of the report in order to decide whether further investigation is called for. If the social worker concludes that an investigation is warranted, he or she can meet with family members and can interview the child. The child is not removed from the home during the investigation unless his or her safety is at risk. The social worker will develop a plan of action for the child and his or her family in coordination with the child\u2019s extended family and professionals such as teachers, early child care workers and cultural workers. A whole range of services may include personal counselling, mentoring by an Elder, access to childhood development programs or to programs designed to enhance the homemaking and parental skills of the caregiver.\n[119] There are circumstances, however, when the risk to the child\u2019s safety or well-being is too great to be mitigated at home, and the child cannot safely remain in his or her family environment. In such circumstances, most provincial statutes require that a social worker first look at the extended family to see if there is an aunt, an uncle or a grandparent who can care for the child. It is only when there is no other solution that a child should be removed from his or her family and placed in foster care under a temporary custody order. Following the issuance of a temporary custody order, the social worker must appear in court to explain the placement and the plan of care for the child and support of the family. The temporary custody order can be renewed and eventually, when all efforts have failed, the child may be placed in permanent care.\n[120] The major categories of child maltreatment are: sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, or exposure thereto, and neglect. For First Nations, the main source of child maltreatment is neglect in the form of a failure to supervise and failure to meet basic needs. Poverty, poor housing and substance abuse are common risk factors on reserves that call for early counselling and support services for children and families to avoid the intervention of child protection services.\nii. The allocation of funding for First Nations child and family services\n[121] AANDC funds child and family services on reserves and in the Yukon in various ways. At the time of the complaint, there were 105 FNCFS Agencies in the 10 provinces across Canada (104 at the time of the hearing). The FNCFS Program, applies to most of the FNCFS Agencies in Canada, uses two funding formulas: Directive 20-1 and the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach (the EPFA). In Ontario, funding is provided through the 1965 Agreement. In certain parts of Alberta and British Columbia, funding is provided through the Alberta Reform Agreement and the BC MOU and, since 2012, the BC Service Agreement. Finally, in the Yukon funding is allocated pursuant to the Yukon Funding Agreement (see testimony of Ms. Barbara D\u2019Amico, Senior Policy Analyst at the Social and Policy Branch of AANDC, Transcript Vol. 50 at p. 141). Each method of funding is addressed in turn.\na. The FNCFS Program\n[122] Beginning with the FNCFS Program, AANDC\u2019s authorities require that, before entering into a funding arrangement with an FNCFS Agency (or Recipient), an agreement be in place between the province or territory and the agency that meets the requirements of AANDC\u2019s national FNCFS Policy (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 4.1). Thereafter, funding is provided through a comprehensive funding arrangement (CFA), which is \u201c\u2026a program-budgeted funding agreement that [AANDC] enters into with Recipients\u2026\u201d (2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 4.4.1). According to the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at section 4.4.1:\n[A CFA] contains components funded by means of a Contribution, which is a reimbursement of eligible expenses and Flexible Transfer Payments, which are formula funded. Surpluses from the Flexible Transfer Payment may be retained by the Recipient provided the terms and conditions of the CFA have been fulfilled. The FNCFS program expects that all surplus money will be used for FNCFS. It is also expected that Recipients will absorb any deficits.\n[123] Funding for FNCFS Agencies is determined in accordance with AANDC \u201cauthorities\u201d (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 1.4). Those \u201cauthorities\u201d are obtained from the federal government through Cabinet and Treasury Board and \u201c\u2026are reflected in the [\u2026] Program Directive\u201d (2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 1.4.5). The Program Directive, also called Directive 20-1 and found at Appendix A of the 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual, \u201c\u2026interprets the authorities and places them into a useable context\u201d (2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 1.4.5). Directive 20-1 is AANDC\u2019s \u201c\u2026national policy statement on FNCFS\u201d (see definition of \u201cProgram Directive 20-1 CHAPTER 5 (Program Directive)\u201d, 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 7, p. 51). It is also:\n\u2026a blueprint on how INAC will administer the FNCFS program from a national perspective, it is also intended to be a teaching document, for new staff at both INAC Headquarters and Regions. The combination of the national manual and the regional manuals should create a clear picture of INAC\u2019s role in FNCFS in Canada\n(2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Introduction, p. 2)\n[124] Prior to 2007, around the time of the Complaint, all provinces and the Yukon, except Ontario, functioned under Directive 20-1. Currently, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Yukon are subject to the application of Directive 20-1.\n[125] In line with the FNCFS Program, the principles of Directive 20-1 include a commitment to \u201c\u2026expanding First Nations Child and Family Services on reserve to a level comparable to the services provided off reserve in similar circumstances [\u2026] in accordance with the applicable provincial child and family services legislation\u201d (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, ss. 6.1 and 6.6). Furthermore, Directive 20-1 supports \u201c\u2026the creation of First Nations designed, controlled and managed services\u201d (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, s. 6.2). Under Directive 20-1, funding for FNCFS agencies is determined through two separate categories: operations and maintenance.\n[126] Operational funding is intended to cover operations and administration costs for such items as salaries and benefits for agency staff, travel expenses, staff training, legal services, family support services and agency administration, including rent and office expenditures (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s.2.2.2 and at Appendix A, s. 19.1). It is calculated using a formula based on the on-reserve population of children aged 0-18 as reported annually by First Nations bands across Canada. The calculation of the operations funding is done annually by AANDC as of December 31 of each year, based on the population statistics of the preceding year (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 3.2). FNCFS Agencies are eligible to receive a fixed administrative allocation pursuant to the following formula:\nA fixed amount $143,158.84 per organization + $10,713.59 per member band + $726.91 per child (0-18 years) + $9,235.23 x average remoteness factor + $8,865.90 per member band x average remoteness factor + $73.65 per child x average remoteness factor + actual costs of the per diem rates of foster homes, group homes and institutions established by the province or territory.\n(see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, s. 19.1(a); see also 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at ss. 3.2.1-3.2.3)\n[127] The adjustment factor is multiplied by $9,235.23, the remoteness factor is multiplied by $8,865.90 times the number of bands within the agency\u2019s catchment area and the child population (0 to 18 years) is multiplied by $73.65 times the remoteness factor (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at s. 3.2.3). The remoteness factor takes into account such things as the distance between the First Nation and a service centre, road access, and availability of services. It can range from 0 to 1.9. If multiple communities are served by an FNCFS Agency, the remoteness factors of each of the communities is averaged to come to the \u2018average remoteness factor\u2019 (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at pp. 28-29).\n[128] The amounts in the operational funding formula are based on certain assumptions emanating from the time it was put in place in the early 1990\u2019s:\nOn average, 6% of the on reserve child population is in care;\nOn average, 20% of families on reserve require child and family services or are classified as multi-problem families;\nOne child care worker and one family support worker for every 20 children in care;\nOne supervisor and one support staff for every 5 workers;\nWages based on average salaries in Ontario and Manitoba\n(see Annex, ex. 13 at pp. 7-8 [Wen:De Report One]).\n[129] According to Ms. D\u2019Amico, the 6% assumption regarding children-in-care is based on the 2007 national average and it provides FNCFS Agencies with stability. That is, even if an agency has or later achieves a smaller percentage of children-in-care, their budget is not affected. The 20% of families requiring services is determined using an assumption that there are on-average three children per family. By dividing the total on-reserve child population by three, AANDC arrives at the number of families it believes would normally be served by the applicable FNCFS Agency. It then takes 20% of that population calculation as a variable in determining the FNCFS Agency\u2019s budget (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 25-31).\n[130] In the first four years of operation of a new FNCFS Agency, the funding formula is gradually implemented at a rate of 75% in the first year, 85% the second year, 95% the third year and 100% in the fourth year [see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at section 3.2.1 and Appendix A, s. 19.1(c)]. Furthermore, for agencies that serve less than 1,000 children, the fixed maximum amount of $143,158.84 is decreased as follows: $71,579.43 (501-800 children); $35,789.10 (251-500); and, regions with a child population of 0 to 250 receive no administrative allocation [see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, s. 19.2(b)]. However, in British Columbia, the full allocation for population begins with at least 801 children (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at p. 23).\n[131] Maintenance funding is intended to cover the actual costs of eligible expenditures for maintaining a First Nations child ordinarily resident on reserve in alternate care out of parental home. Children must be taken into care in accordance with provincially or territorially approved legislation, standards and rates for foster home, group home and institutional care. FNCFS Agencies are required to submit monthly invoices for children in care out of the parental home and are to be reimbursed on the basis of actual expenditures (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at ss. 3.3.1-3.3.2 and Appendix A, s. 20.1).\n[132] Until 2011, FNCFS Agencies in British Columbia were funded on a per diem structure, but have since transitioned to reimbursement for maintenance expenses based on actual costs. However, if funding based on actuals provides for less funding, the previous per diem funding levels are maintained as part of a plan to eventually transition FNCFS Agencies in that province to the EPFA (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at pp. 35-36; and, testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 150-151).\n[133] FNCFS Agencies also have the option of applying for \u201cflexible\u201d funding for maintenance under Directive 20-1 (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, s. 20.2). This option allows agencies to receive a payment of their total operational funding allocation, along with a historically based estimate of their maintenance costs. This flexible funding option is meant to provide FNCFS Agencies with increased flexibility to re-profile maintenance funding to provide increased resources for prevention. To access this flexible funding option an FNCFS Agency must undergo an assessment and receive approval from AANDC\u2019s regional office, along with approval from AANDC Headquarters. In 2006, only 7 out of 105 FNCFS Agencies utilized the flexible funding option (see Annex, ex. 14 at p. 5 [2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program]).\n[134] The monetary amounts reflected in Directive 20-1 reflect 1995-1996 values and have not been significantly modified since that time, despite the directive providing for them to be increased by 2% every year, subject to the availability of resources (see 2005 FNCFS National Program Manual at Appendix A, s. 22.00; and, testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 64 at pp. 3-4). Furthermore, maximum funding by AANDC is 100 percent of eligible costs. FNCFS Agencies may be required to repay funds to AANDC if their total funding from all sources, including from voluntary sector sources, exceeds eligible expenditures and when AANDC\u2019s contribution thereto is in excess of $100,000 (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 10, s. 11.0 [the stacking provisions]).\n[135] Since 2005, an 8.24 percent increase has been applied to each FNCFS Agency\u2019s total allocation under Directive 20-1 (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at p. 32; and, testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at p. 17). Additional funding is also provided in New Brunswick for the Head Start program and for in-home care as a precursor to the transition to the EPFA (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 169-173).\n[136] That is, since 2007, AANDC has transitioned the funding model for certain provinces under the FNCFS Program from Directive 20-1 to the EPFA. An agreement was reached to implement the EPFA in Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2007, Nova Scotia in 2008, Qu\u00e9bec in 2009, Prince Edward Island in 2009 and Manitoba in 2010.\n[137] Under EPFA, prevention is included as a third funding stream to operations and maintenance. Prevention services are \u201c\u2026designed to reduce the incidence of family dysfunction and breakdown or crisis and to reduce the need to take children into Alternate Care or the amount of time a child remains in Alternate Care\u201d (2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 33, s. 2.1.17; see also p. 38, s. 4.4.1). Eligible expenses under this prevention funding stream include: salaries and benefits for prevention and resource workers, travel, paraprofessional services, family support services, mentoring services for children, home management services, and non-medical counselling services not covered by other funding sources (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 38, s. 4.4.2).\n[138] Implementation of the EPFA begins with tri-partite discussions between the province, First Nation community and AANDC. From the tripartite discussions, a Tripartite Accountability Framework is developed outlining the goals, objectives, performance indicators, and roles and responsibilities of the parties. Using the Tripartite Accountability Framework as a benchmark, the FNCFS Agency prepares an initial 5-year business plan, which is subject to AANDC review and acceptance by the province. The business plan is a pre-requisite in order to receive funding under the EPFA (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 37, s. 4.3; see also testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 50 at pp. 146-152).\n[139] Once the framework and business plan are in place, the costing discussions take place. According to the 2012 National Social Programs Manual, funding for operations and prevention services are based on a cost-model developed at regional tri-partite tables and are consistent with reasonable comparability to the respective province within AANDC\u2019s program authority (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 38, s. 4.4.1). That is, the EPFA is to be tailored to each jurisdiction using a formula made-up of line-items that are identified at tripartite tables. The determination of staffing numbers and which line items to include in the formula, and the dollar values assigned to each of those line items, is based on variables provided by the province (for example staffing ratios, caseload ratios, and salary grades). Those amounts are then worked into AANDC\u2019s operations and prevention cost-model. A cost-model is utilized because the provinces do not always use a funding formula that AANDC can replicate (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 50 at pp. 56, 150-151; and, Vol. 51 at pp.18-66, 153-154).\n[140] Similar to Directive 20-1, the formula for the EPFA is based on the child population served by the FNCFS Agency and the assumptions that a minimum of 20% of families are in need of child and family services and that 6% of children are in care (although in Manitoba an assumption of 7% of children in care is used in the EPFA formula). The prevention focused services component of the EPFA formula is largely based on the salaries needed for service delivery staff, where the amount of staff needed is calculated based on the assumed amount of children in care and families in need of services. The estimated amount of children in care is calculated by multiplying the child population served by the FNCFS Agency by the assumed percentage of children in care. As mentioned above, the number of families in need of services is calculated by taking the total child population served by the FNCFS Agency, dividing it by the average amount of children per First Nation family (3), and then multiplying that number by the assumed percentage of families in need of prevention services (20%) (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 24-31).\n[141] The calculated estimates of children in care and families in need of care are then used to determine the amount of service delivery staff needed for the FNCFS Agency. Similar to Directive 20-1, provincial ratios in terms of social workers per children in care or families in need, supervisors per amount of socials workers, and support staff per amount of workers are used to estimate the staff needed for specific positions. The average salaries for those positions within the province, at the time EPFA is implemented, then make up the bulk of funding provided for the prevention focused services component of the funding formula (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 32-79). As Ms. Murphy explained:\nWe are from a funding perspective, so how the provinces fund is what we want to stay comparable with, not the types of services that the province funds -- or provides, excuse me.\n[\u2026]\nAnd the only way that we could find that, a way to be comparable, was to identify the variables, those calculation variables; so the salary grids, the ratios \u2013 the staffing ratios, the caseload ratios. Those were the only funding tools that we could find to be comparable, and that is why we had incorporated that into the EPFA formula.\n(Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 178-179)\n[142] Eligible expenditures for maintenance and operations under the EPFA are outlined at sections 3.4 and 3.5 of Directive 20-1 (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 38, s. 4.4.1). AANDC expects FNCFS Agencies to manage their operations and prevention costs within the budgets they have (see testimony of S. Murphy, Transcript Vol. 54 at p. 170). However, the EPFA does allow agencies flexibility in moving funding from one stream (operations, maintenance or prevention) to another \u201c\u2026in order to address needs and circumstances facing individual communities\u201d (2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 38, s. 4.4.1).\n[143] Under EPFA, funding for prevention and operations is determined at the beginning of a five year period on a fixed cost basis (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 53 at p.16). EPFA funding is then rolled-out over a 3-4 year period, where the FNCFS Agency receives 40% of funding in year 1, 60% in year 2 and between 80% and 100% in year 3. The full funding amount is provided by year 4 (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 52 at pp. 145-146). Once EPFA is fully implemented, the only revision in the funding formula from year to year is to account for the child population served by the FNCFS Agency. EPFA does not provide additional funding for increases in operations or prevention costs over time, such as for changes to professional services rates or incremental increases in salaries (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 52 at pp. 147-150; see also 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 37, s. 4.1)\n[144] For example, in Alberta, where the EPFA was first implemented in 2007, the average salaries for service delivery staff from that initial implementation of the EPFA, based on 2006 values, are still being applied eight years later to the calculation of 2014 budgets (see testimony of B. D\u2019Amico, Transcript Vol. 52 at p. 153; and, testimony of Ms. Carol Schimanke, Manager of Social Development, Child and Family Services Program, AANDC Alberta Regional Office, Transcript Vol. 61 at pp. 115-116). According to Ms. D\u2019Amico, the rationale behind this is as follows:\nBecause what the idea of EPFA was that if you placed more money in prevention and did a lot more early intervention work, your maintenance costs would go down. When those maintenance costs go down, that money could be reinvested into operations.\nSo the idea -- and this is not in practice, but the idea behind this was for it -- for the Agencies to be self-sufficient and be able to move the monies from one stream to another. So that's why there was no escalator included in here.\nThis is an issue we are now reviewing about what happens after year five if the maintenance isn't supplying the operations anymore, or never did, so, what if that theory doesn't work?\n(Transcript Vol. 52 at pp. 150-151)\n[145] Ms. D`Amico specified that in practice, given that some FNCFS Agencies are doing more intake and investigations as part of their prevention strategies, this has led to more kids in care and no reduction in maintenance costs (see Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 91-92). The EPFA funding formula also does not include funds for intake and investigation.\n[146] Maintenance funding under the EPFA is budgeted annually based on actual expenditures from the previous year (see 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 38, section 4.4.1). AANDC \u201cre-bases\u201d an agency\u2018s maintenance budget each year. For example, if an agency\u2018s maintenance budget is $100 in year one, but its expenditures for that year total only $80, AANDC will reduce its maintenance budget in the second year to $80. If in the second year that agency\u2018s number of children in care increases unexpectedly, the agency must work within its existing budget to manage those costs in the interim.\n[147] In other words, if maintenance costs are greater than the set amount of maintenance funding, the FNCFS Agency must recover the deficit from its operations and\/or prevention funding streams. If there is still a deficit in maintenance, AANDC has some funds that it holds back centrally at the beginning of each fiscal year to help manage those types of situations. When that fund is depleted, AANDC reallocates money from other programs within AANDC to cover the maintenance costs. If an FNCFS Agency has a surplus from its maintenance budget, the agency can keep it and re-apply it to other eligible expenses (see testimony of C. Schimanke, Transcript Vol. 61 at pp. 91, 96-98; testimony of B. D\u2018Amico, Transcript Vol. 50 at pp. 174-181; and, testimony of S. Murphy, Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 167-168, 172-174).\n[148] AANDC receives a 2% increase in its budget for Social Programs every year. However, for the FNCFS Program, that 2% increase is calculated based on the budget of the FNCFS Program prior to the implementation of the EPFA, at about $450 million. Ms. Murphy estimated the current budget of the FNCFS Program, with the implementation of the EPFA, to be approximately $627 million. In her words:\nSo the difference in that, between that 450 million has been made up of some of the two percent -- the portion of growth, some of it's the incremental investments that have come to the Department through the EPFA for those six jurisdictions and the rest of it is resource re-allocations.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 177, 189-191; see also, Vol. 55 at pp. 188-189)\nb. Reports on the FNCFS Program\n[149] The FNCFS Program has been examined in multiple reports: the First Nations Child and Family Services Joint National Policy Review, referred to above as the NPR, in 2000; three related studies from 2004-2005 referred to as the Wen:De reports; and, two Auditor General of Canada reports in 2008 and 2011, along with follow-up reports thereon by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts.\nFirst Nations Child and Family Services Joint National Policy Review Final Report\n[150] The NPR was published in 2000. It is a collaborative report by AANDC and the Assembly of First Nations. Although the NPR pre-dates the complaint by about 8 years, its study of the impacts of Directive 20-1 is still relevant given that the funding formula still applies to many FNCFS Agencies and in the Yukon. The report also outlines a rigorous methodology and consultation in arriving at its conclusions. The Panel finds this early study of Directive 20-1 informative and a useful starting point in understanding the impacts of AANDC\u2019s funding formula on First Nations children and families on reserves.\n[151] The NPR describes the context of First Nations child and family services as including several experiences of massive loss, resulting in identity problems and difficulties in functioning for many First Nations and their families. These experiences include the historical experience of residential schools and its inter-generational effects, and the migration of First Nations out of reserves causing disruption to the traditional concept of family (see NPR at pp. 32-33). As the NPR puts it at page 33:\nFirst Nation families have been in the centre of a historical struggle between colonial government on one hand, who set out to eradicate their culture, language and world view, and that of the traditional family, who believed in maintaining a balance in the world for the children and those yet unborn. This struggle has caused dysfunction, high suicide rates, and violence, which have had vast inter-generational impacts.\n[152] According to the NPR, \u201cProgram Directive 20-1 was developed to provide equity, predictability and flexibility in the funding of first nations child and family services agencies\u201d (at p.10). A principle of Directive 20-1 is that AANDC is committed to the expansion of child and family services on reserve to a level comparable to the services off reserve in similar circumstances (see NPR at p. 20). This is AANDC\u2019s own standard and it expects FNCFS Agencies to abide by it:\nFNCFS Agencies are expected through their delegation of authority from the provinces, the expectations of their communities and by DIAND, to provide a comparable range of services on reserve with the funding they receive through Directive 20-1.\n(NPR at p. 83, emphasis added)\n[153] However, the NPR found the funding formula under Directive 20-1 inhibited FNCFS Agencies\u2019 ability to meet the expectation of providing a comparable range of child and family services on reserve for a number of reasons:\nThe formula provides the same level of funding to agencies regardless of how broad, intense or costly, the range of service is (at p. 83).\nVariance in the definition of maintenance expenses from region to region, resulting in AANDC rejecting maintenance expenses that ought to have been reimbursed in accordance with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards (at pp. 13-14, 84).\nInsufficient funding for staff and not enough flexibility in the funding formula for agencies to adjust to changing conditions (increases in number of children coming into care; development of new provincial\/territorial programs; or, routine price adjustments for remoteness) (at pp. 13-14, 65, 70, 92-93, 96-97).\nThere has not been an increase in cost of living since 1995-1996 (at pp. 18, 26).\nFunding only provided to new FNCFS agencies for 3 year and 6 year evaluations; however, provincial legislation requires on-going evaluations (at p. 11).\nFirst Nations have to comply with the same administrative burden created by change in provincial legislation but have not received any increased resources to meet those responsibilities, contradicting the principle of Directive 20-1 (at p. 12).\nUnrealistic amount of administration support to smaller agencies, often compounded by remoteness (at pp. 14, 97).\nThe maximum annual budgetary increase of 2% did not reflect the average annual increase of 6.2% in the FNCFS Agencies (at p. 14).\nThe average per capita per child in care expenditure was 22% lower than the average in the provinces (at p. 14).\nThe formula does not provide adequate resources to allow FNCFS Agencies to do legislated\/targeted prevention, alternative programs and least disruptive\/intrusive measures for children at risk (at p. 120).\n[154] The NPR made 17 recommendations to address these areas of concern with respect to Directive 20-1, including investigating a new methodology for funding operations. It was recommended that the new funding methodology consider factors such as work-load case analysis, national demographics and the impact on large and small agencies, and economy of scale (see NPR at pp. 119-121). A further recommendation was to develop a management information system in order to ensure the establishment of consistent, reliable data collection, analysis and reporting procedures amongst AANDC, FNCFS Agencies and the provinces\/territory (see NPR at p. 121).\nThe Wen:De Reports\n[155] The NPR led to the establishment of the Joint National Policy Review National Advisory Committee (the NAC) in 2001. The NAC involved officials from AANDC, the AFN and FNCFS Agencies. One of the tasks of the NAC was to explore how to change parts of Directive 20-1 in line with the NPR recommendations. Funded by AANDC, the NAC commissioned further research in order to establish that revisions of the FNCFS Program and Directive 20-1 were warranted. Three reports were produced on the subject: the Wen:De Reports. Each of the three reports outlines clearly the methodology used to arrive at its findings and explains those findings in great detail. Three important contributing authors of the Wen:De reports, Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Dr. John Loxley, and Dr. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9 testified at length about the reports at the hearing and confirmed the findings in these reports.\n[156] The objective of the first Wen:De report in 2004 was to identify three new options for FNCFS Agency funding and the research agenda needed to inform each of those options (see Wen:De Report One at p. 4). The authors explain how they reviewed pertinent literature from Canada and abroad; conducted interviews with informed observers and participants, including the Operations Formula Funding Design Team; and met with six FNCFS Agencies representing differing agency sizes, service contexts, regions and cultural groups (see Wen:De Report One at p. 6).\n[157] The authors noted that the concerns and challenges expressed by the FNCFS Agencies that it interviewed were in line with the NPR findings and recommendations, such as the lack of funding for prevention services, legal services, capital costs, management information systems, culturally based programs, caregivers, staff salaries and training, and costs adjustments for remote and small agencies (see Wen:De Report One at pp. 6, 8).\n[158] Notably, the report found FNCFS Agencies \u201c\u2026are not funded on the basis of a determination of need but rather on population levels\u201d resulting in \u201c\u2026significant regional variation in the implementation of Directive 20-1 as funding officials within the department adapted to their local context\u201d (Wen:De Report One at p. 5). As a result, it concluded:\nOverall, our findings affirm that the findings and recommendations of the NPR which was completed in June of 2000 continue to be reflective of the concerns that FNCFSA are experiencing today. [\u2026] All agencies agreed that immediate redress of inadequate funding was necessary to support good social work practice in their communities.\n(Wen:De Report One at p. 6)\n[159] Wen:De Report One presents three options to address this conclusion: (1) redesign the existing funding formula; (2) follow the funding model of the province\/territory in which the agency is located; or, (3) a new First Nations based funding formula that funds agencies on the basis of community needs and assets, along with the particular socio-economic and cultural characteristics of the communities and Nations which the agencies serve (see Wen:De Report One at pp. 7-13).\n[160] The second Wen:De report analyzed the three options presented in the first report (see Annex, ex. 15 [Wen:De Report Two]). To do so, the various authors of the report conducted literature reviews and key informant interviews with twelve sample FNCFS Agencies. A key method was to conduct detailed case studies of the twelve sample agencies and the provinces using standardized questionnaires administered by regional researchers. The research approach involved specialized research projects on the incidence and social work response to reports of child maltreatment respecting First Nations children, prevention services, jurisdictional issues, extraordinary circumstances, management information services and small agencies (see Wen:De Report Two at pp. 7, 9-11).\n[161] Wen:De Report Two begins by examining the experience of First Nations children coming into contact with the child welfare system in Canada. It notes that the key drivers of neglect for First Nations children are poverty, poor housing and substance misuse. The report underscores that two of those three factors are arguably outside the control of parents: poverty and poor housing. As such, parents are unlikely to be able to redress these risks and it can mean that their children are more likely to stay in care for prolonged periods of time and, in some cases, permanently (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 13). On this issue, Wen:De Report Two indicates:\nThere are approximately three times the numbers of First Nations children in state care than there were at the height of residential schools in the 1940s (see at p. 8).\nAboriginal children are more than twice as likely to be investigated compared to non-Aboriginal children (see at p. 15).\nOnce investigated, cases involving Aboriginal children are more likely to be substantiated and more likely to require on-going child welfare services (see at p. 15).\nAboriginal children are more than twice as likely to be placed in out of home care, and more likely to be brought to child welfare court (see at p. 15).\nThe profiles of Aboriginal families differ dramatically from the profile of non-Aboriginal families (see at p. 15).\nAboriginal cases predominantly involve situations of neglect where poverty, inadequate housing and parent substance abuse are a toxic combination of risk factors (see at p. 15).\n[162] Overall, with regard to funding under the FNCFS Program, at page 7, Wen:De Report Two found that:\nFirst Nations child and family service agencies are inadequately funded in almost every area of operation ranging from capital costs, prevention programs, standards and evaluation, staff salaries and child in care programs. The disproportionate need for services amongst First Nations children and families coupled with the under-funding of the First Nations child and family service agencies that serve them has resulted in an untenable situation.\n[163] Based on its research findings, the report indicates that Directive 20-1 would need substantial alteration in order to meet the requirements of the FNCFS Program and to ensure equitable child welfare services for First Nations children resident on reserve. There are a number of issues causing an inadequacy in funding. The lack of an adjustment to funding levels for increases in the cost of living is identified as one of the major weaknesses of Directive 20-1. Although Directive 20-1 contains a cost of living adjustment, it has not been implemented since 1995. According to Wen:De Report Two, not adjusting funding for increases in cost of living \u201c\u2026leads to both under-funding of services and to distortion in the services funded since some expenses subject to inflation must be covered, while others may be more optional (at p. 45). Wen:De Report Two calculates prices increased by 21.21% over the ten year period since Directive 20-1 was last adjusted for cost of living (see a p. 45). To restore the loss of purchasing power since 1995, it found $24.8 million would be needed to meet the cost of living requirements for 2005 alone (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 51).\n[164] Similarly, Directive 20-1 contains no periodic reconciliation for inflation. For example, since Directive 20-1 was introduced in 1990, there has been no adjustment for salary increases. Two thirds of FNCFS Agencies participating in Wen:De Report Two reported funding for salaries and benefits was not sufficient (see at pp. 35, 57). Wen:De Report Two estimates the loss of funds due to inflation for the operations portion of Directive 20-1 to be $112 million (at p. 57). It adds, any increases in funding only come with increases in the number of children served. Therefore, in the circumstances, \u201ceither the quality of services must have declined if child and family needs grew proportionately with population or, increases in costs of services can have been covered, if at all, only from a reduction in the proportion of children or families receiving services\u201d (at p. 121).\n[165] The population thresholds were also found by all agencies to be an inadequate means of benchmarking operations funding levels. Approximately half of the respondents to the study stated funding should be based on community needs not child population. Some added that the entire community population should be taken into account, not just that of children, since it is the entire family that needs support when a child is at risk or is unsafe. In fact, small agencies (those serving child populations of less than 1,000) represent 55% of the total number of FNCFS Agencies. According to 75% of the small agencies who participated in Wen:De Report Two, their salary and benefits levels for staff were not comparable to other child welfare organizations (see at pp. 46-48, 213).\n[166] In addition, Directive 20-1 provides no adjustment for the different content of provincial\/territorial legislation and standards. While the FNCFS Program includes a guiding principle that services should be reasonably comparable to those provided to children in similar circumstances off reserve, it contains no mechanism to ensure this is achieved (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 50).\n[167] Aside from the above, Wen:De Report Two found consensus among FNCFS Agencies it canvassed that Directive 20-1 makes inadequate provision for travel, legal costs, front-line workers, program evaluation, accounting and janitorial staff, staff meetings, Health and Safety Committee meetings, security systems, human resources staff for large agencies, quality assurance specialists and management information systems. Furthermore, Wen:De Report Two comments that funding has not reflected the significant technology changes in computer hardware and software over the past decade. Moreover, liability insurance premiums have increased substantially over that same period and are not reflected in Directive 20-1 (see at p. 122). Wen:De Report Two also identified management information systems as not meeting minimum standards in the vast majority of cases (see at p. 57).\n[168] Of particular note, funds for prevention and least disruptive measures were identified as inadequate, along with 84% of reporting FNCFS Agencies feeling that current funding levels were insufficient to provide adequate culturally based services (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 57). In this regard, the report found that \u201cthe present funding formula provides more incentives for taking children into care than it provides support for preventive, early intervention and least intrusive measures\u201d (Wen:De Report Two at p. 114). This is because the funding formula provides dollar-for-dollar reimbursement of \u201cmaintenance\u201d expenditures and prevention services are often not deemed to fall under \u201cmaintenance\u201d (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 19-21). As a result, prevention funding was identified as being inadequate, in spite of the fact that such services are mandated under most provincial child welfare legislation (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 91). On this basis, the report states:\nThis means that agencies in this situation effectively have no money to comply with the statutory requirement to provide families with a meaningful opportunity to redress the risk that resulted in their child being removed. More importantly, the children they serve are denied an equitable chance to stay safely at home due to the structure and amount of funding under the Directive. In this way the Directive really does shape practice \u2013 instead of supporting good practice.\n(Wen:De Report Two at p. 21)\n[169] Wen:De Report Two concludes option three, a new First Nations based funding formula that funds agencies based on needs and assets, is the most promising way to address these deficiencies because of the \u201c\u2026possibility of re-conceptualizing the pedagogy, policy and practice in First Nations child welfare in a way that better supports sustained positive outcomes for First Nations children\u201d (Wen:De Report Two at p. 9). In sum, Wen:De Report Two recommends: targeted funding for least disruptive measures; funds for adequate culturally based policy and standards development; ensure that human resources funds are sufficient; increased investment in research to inform policy and practice for FNCFS Agencies; and, introduce financial review and adjustment to account for changes to provincial child welfare legislation (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 56).\n[170] The third Wen:De report involved the development and costing of the recommended changes arising from the second report (see Annex, ex. 16 [Wen:De Report Three]). A national survey instrument was developed and sent out to 93 FNCFS Agencies. Thirty-five surveys were completed, representing 32,575 children, 146 First Nations and $28.6 million in operating funds. This covered 38% of all FNCFS Agencies, 49% of all bands, 31.4% of all children 0-18 and 28.7% of all funding for operations (see Wen:De Report Three at pp. 9-10).\n[171] Wen:De Report Three reiterates the weaknesses in Directive 20-1 as follows at pages11-12:\n1) uncertainty in what the original rationale was underlying the development of the formula 2) regional interpretations of sometimes vaguely worded guidelines, 3) a failure to implement certain elements of the formula such as the annual inflation adjustment and 4) a failure of the policy to keep pace with advances in social work evidence based practice, child welfare liability law and the evolution of management information systems and 5) the policy appeared to leave out some child welfare expenses altogether or fund them inadequately such as the failure of the policy to support agencies to provide in home interventions to abused and neglected children to keep them safely at home as opposed to bringing them into care.\n[172] Despite these weaknesses, Wen:De Report Three also indicates Directive 20-1 has some positive features, including that it is national in scope, has undergone two national studies, has enabled the development of FNCFS Agencies throughout Canada, and offers a baseline for judging the impacts of possible changes to the current regime.\n[173] These reasons were the principle basis forming the recommendation in Wen:De Report Three to implement both options 1 and 3. That is, redesign Directive 20-1 now, with a priority on funding prevention services and providing redress for losses in funding due to inflation, while providing a foundation for the development of a First Nations based formula over time (see Wen:De Report Three at pp. 11-12). In also pursuing option 1, the report noted the development of a First Nations funding model would not provide a quick fix to the problems with the existing funding formula (see Wen:De Report Three at p. 14).\n[174] Option two, tying FNCFS Agency funding to provincial formulae, was found to be the least promising option, notably because in several provinces it is not clear what their formula is and First Nation communities do not have the same degree of infrastructure of programs, services and volunteer agencies. Moreover, provincial funding traditions are not based on the particular needs and conditions faced by First Nation families living on reserve, including that it costs more to service First Nations children and families due to their high needs levels (see Wen:De Report Three at p. 13).\n[175] In recommending reforms to Directive 20-1, Wen:De Report Three noted that \u201c[a] shift in funding mentality is vital\u201d (at p. 20). That is, as stated at page 20 of Wen:De Report Three:\nAn approach that invests in the community and engages the community at all levels \u2013 children, adolescents, youth, parents and Elders means directing resources at growth and development of the people rather than the breakdowns of the people in the community. This approach demonstrates long term commitment to the growth of a child and family and invests in the future of contributing members to society.\n[176] Furthermore, at page 15, Wen:De Report Three provides the following caution:\nAlthough each suggested change element is presented as a separate item, it is important to understand that these elements are interdependent and adoption in a piece meal fashion would undermine the overall efficacy of the proposed changes. For example, providing least disruptive measures funding for at home child maltreatment interventions without providing the cost of living adjustment would result in agencies not having the infrastructure and staffing capacity to maximize outcomes. Similarly, these recommendations assume that there will be no reductions in the First Nations child and family service agency funding envelope. Situations where funds in one area are cut back and redirected to other funding streams in child and family services should be avoided as our research found that under funding was apparent across the current formula components.\n[177] Wen:De Report Three recommends certain economic reforms to Directive 20-1, along with policy changes to support those reforms. The recommended economic reforms from Wen:De Report Three, include: a new funding stream for prevention\/least disruptive measures (at pp. 19-21); adjusting the operations budget (at pp. 24-25); reinstating the annual cost of living adjustment on a retroactive basis back to 1995 (at pp. 18-19); providing sufficient funding to cover capital costs (buildings, vehicles and office equipment) (at pp. 28-29); and, funding for the development of culturally based standards by FNCFS Agencies (at p. 30).\n[178] Of particular note, Wen:De Report Three recommends a new funding stream for prevention\/least disruptive measures (at pp. 19-21). At page 35, Wen:De Report Three indicates that increased funding for prevention\/least disruptive measures will provide costs savings over time:\nBowlus and McKenna (2003) estimate that the annual cost of child maltreatment to Canadian society is 16 billion dollars per annum. As increasing numbers of studies indicate that First Nations children are over represented amongst children in care and Aboriginal children in care they compose a significant portion of these economic costs (Trocme, Knoke and Blackstock, 2004; Trocme, Fallon, McLaurin and Shangreaux, 2005; McKenzie, 2002). A failure of governments to invest in a substantial way in prevention and least disruptive measures is a false economy \u2013 The choice is to either invest now and save later or save now and pay up to 6-7 times more later (World Health Organization, 2004.)\n[179] For small agencies the report found that the fixed amount per agency or the provision for overhead did not provide realistic administrative support for two reasons. The first is that no agency representing communities with a combined total of 250 or fewer children receives any overhead funding whatsoever. The second problem is that available funding is currently fixed in three large blocks: 251-500 = $ 35,790; 501-800 = $ 71,580; and, 801 and up = $143,158. A slight increase or decrease in child population can result in a huge increase or decrease in overhead funding available to an agency (see Wen:De Report Three at p. 23).\n[180] Therefore, Wen:De Report Three recommends two reforms. First, that overhead funding be extended to agencies serving populations of 125 and above. The report proposes a minimum of $20,000 be made available to the smallest agency representing 125 children. Thereafter, the second proposal is to give agencies additional funding for every 25 children in excess of 125. Under this approach, 6 agencies would still be too small to receive any fixed amount; 8 small agencies which never before received a fixed amount of overhead funding would now do so; 23 agencies of medium size would receive funding increases; and, 56 large agencies would receive no change in their funding. In the future, Wen:De Report Three believes a minimum economy of scale for small agencies will be required to provide a basic level of child and family services (see at p. 23-24).\n[181] In terms of the remoteness factor in Directive 20-1, Wen:De Report Three identified a number of weaknesses, including that the average adjustment is considered by 90% of the agencies canvassed to be too small to compensate for the actual costs of remoteness; and, that the remoteness index is usually based on accessibility to the nearest business centre, which are not necessarily able to offer specialized child welfare services. According to Wen:De Report Three, these weakness have led to some communities receiving less than their population warrants and some receiving more. As such, it proposes an across the board increase in remoteness allowances and to adjust the index from the current service centre base to a city centre base (see at pp. 25-26).\n[182] Other policy recommendations from Wen:De Report Three include: that AANDC clarify that legal costs related to children in care are billable under \u201cmaintenance\u201d; that support services related to reunifying children in care with their families be eligible \u201cmaintenance\u201d expenses, since they are mandatory services according to provincial child welfare statutes; validation of the need for research and mechanisms to share best practices at a regional and national level; and, that AANDC clarify the \u201cstacking provisions\u201d in Directive 20-1 in order to make it easier for First Nations to access voluntary sector funding sources (at pp. 16-18).\n[183] Finally, Wen:De Report Three found jurisdictional disputes between federal government departments and between the federal government and provinces over who should fund a particular service took about 50.25 person hours to resolve, resulting in a significant tax on the limited resources of FNCFS Agencies. As a result, it recommends the immediate implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle for jurisdictional dispute resolution and its integration into any funding agreements between AANDC and the provinces. Jordan\u2019s Principle asserts that the government (federal or provincial) or department that first receives a request to pay for a service must pay for the service and resolve jurisdictional issues thereafter (see Wen:De Report Three at p. 16).\n[184] Total costs of implementing all the reforms recommended in Wen:De Report Three were estimated at $109.3 million, including $22.9 million for new management information systems, capital costs (buildings, vehicles and office equipment) and insurance premiums; and, $86.4 million for annual funding needs (see at p. 33).\n[185] The EPFA was designed in an effort to address some of the shortcomings of Directive 20-1 identified in the NPR and the Wen:De reports. However, despite Wen:De Report Three\u2019s caution that the recommended changes are interdependent and adoption in a piece meal fashion would undermine the efficacy of those proposed changes, this is in fact the approach AANDC took. This becomes clear in reviewing the Auditor General of Canada\u2019s 2008 report on the FNCFS Program and AANDC\u2019s corresponding responses, along with the rest of the evidence to follow.\n2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada\n[186] Following a written request from the Caring Society, the Auditor General of Canada initiated a review of AANDC\u2019s FNCFS Program and reported the findings to the House of Commons in 2008 (see Annex, ex. 17 [2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada]). The purpose of the review was to examine the \u201c\u2026management structure, the processes, and the federal resources used to implement the federal policy\u2026\u201d on reserves (2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p.1).\n[187] The 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada echoed the findings of the NPR and Wen:De reports. Namely, that \u201c[c]urrent funding practices do not lead to equitable funding among Aboriginal and First Nations communities\u201d (2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p.2). The findings of the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada include:\nThe funding formula is outdated and does not take into account any costs associated with modifications to provincial legislation or with changes in the way services are provided (see at p. 20, s. 4.51),\nAANDC has limited assurance that child welfare services delivered on reserves comply with provincial legislation and standards. Funding levels are pre-determined without regard to the services the agency is bound to provide under provincial legislation and standards (see at pp.14-15, ss. 4.30, 4.34).\nThere is no definition of what is meant by reasonably comparable services or way of knowing whether the services that the program supports are in fact reasonably comparable. Furthermore, child welfare may be complicated by other social problems or health issues. Access to social and health services, aside from child welfare services, to help keep a family together differs not only on and off reserves but among First Nations as well. AANDC has not determined what other social and health services are available on reserves to support child welfare services. On-reserve child welfare services cannot be comparable if they have to deal with problems that, off reserves, would be addressed by other social and health services (see at pp. 12-13, ss.4.20, 4.25).\nThere are no standards for FNCFS Agencies to provide culturally appropriate child welfare services that meet the requirements of provincial legislation. The number of FNCFS Agencies being funded is the main indicator of cultural appropriateness that AANDC uses. According to AANDC, the fact that 82 First Nations agencies have been created since the current federal policy was adopted means there are more First Nations children receiving culturally appropriate child welfare services. However, the Auditor General found that many agencies provide only a limited portion of the services while provinces continue to provide the rest. Further, AANDC does not know nationally how many of the children placed in care remain in their communities or are in First Nations foster homes or institutions (see at p. 13, ss. 4.24-4.25).\nThe formula is based on the assumption that each FNCFS Agency has 6% of on-reserve children placed in care. This assumption leads to funding inequities among FNCFS Agencies because, in practice, the percentage of children that they bring into care varies widely. For example, in the five provinces covered by the report, that percentage ranged from 0 to 28% (see at p. 20, s. 4.52).\nThe funding formula is not responsive to factors that can cause wide variations in operating costs, such as differences in community needs or in support services available, in the child welfare services provided to on-reserve First Nations children, and in the actual work performed by FNCFS Agencies (see at p. 20, s. 4.52).\nThe formula is not adapted to small agencies. It was designed on the basis that First Nations agencies would be responsible for serving a community, or a group of communities, where at least 1,000 children live on reserve. The Auditor General found 55 of the 108 agencies funded by AANDC were small agencies serving a population of less than 1000 children living on reserve who did not always have the funding and capacity to provide the required range of child welfare services (see at p. 21, ss. 4.55-4.56).\nThe shortcomings of the funding formula have been known to AANDC for years (see at p. 21, s. 4.57).\n[188] As certain provinces were transitioned to the EPFA at the time of the report, the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada also comments on the new funding formula. It found that while the new funding formula provides more funds for the operations of FNCFS Agencies and offers more flexibility to allocate resources, it does not address the inequities noted under the current formula. It still assumes that a fixed percentage of First Nations children and families need child welfare services and, therefore, does not address differing needs among First Nations (see 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 23, ss. 4.63-4.64).\n[189] Overall, the Auditor General of Canada was of the view that:\nthe funding formula needs to become more than a means of distributing the program\u2019s budget. As currently designed and implemented, the formula does not treat First Nations or provinces in a consistent or equitable manner. One consequence of this situation is that many on-reserve children and families do not always have access to the child welfare services defined in relevant provincial legislation and available to those living off reserves.\n(2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 23, s. 4.66)\n[190] The Auditor General further noted that because the FNCFS Program\u2019s expenditures were growing faster than AANDC\u2019s overall budget, funds had to be reallocated from other programs, such as community infrastructure and housing. This means spending on housing has not kept pace with growth in population and community infrastructure has deteriorated at a faster rate. In the Auditor General\u2019s view, AANDC\u2019s budgeting approach for the FNCFS Program is not sustainable and needs to minimize the impact on other important departmental programs (see 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 25, ss. 4.72-4.73).\n[191] The Auditor General of Canada made 6 recommendations to address the findings in its report. AANDC agreed with all the recommendations and indicated the actions it has taken or will take to address the recommendations (see 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 6 and Appendix). AANDC\u2019s response to the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada demonstrates its full awareness of the impacts of its FNCFS Program on First Nations children and families on reserves, including that its funding is not in line with provincial legislation and standards. Furthermore, despite the flaws identified with the new funding formula, AANDC still viewed EPFA as the answer to the problems with the FNCFS Program:\n4.67 Recommendation. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, in consultation with First Nations and provinces, should ensure that its new funding formula and approach to funding First Nations agencies are directly linked with provincial legislation and standards, reflect the current range of child welfare services, and take into account the varying populations and needs of First Nations communities for which it funds on-reserve child welfare services.\nThe Department\u2019s response. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\u2019s current approach to Child and Family Services includes reimbursement of actual costs associated with the needs of maintaining a child in care. The Department agrees that as new partnerships are entered into, based on the enhanced prevention approach, funding will be directly linked to activities that better support the needs of children in care and incorporate provincial legislation and practice standards.\n(2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at pp. 23-24, s. 4.67)\n[192] The flaws with Directive 20-1 and the EPFA would subsequently be scrutinized by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.\n2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts\n[193] In February 2009, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts held a hearing on the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada. This hearing was held with officials from the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and AANDC \u201c[g]iven the importance of the safety and well-being of all Canadian children and the disturbing findings of the audit\u201d (Annex, ex.18 at p.1 [2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts]).\n[194] The Committee noted the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada made 6 recommendations and that it fully supports those recommendations. As AANDC agreed with all the recommendations, \u201cthe Committee expects that the Department will fully implement them\u201d (2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 3).\n[195] AANDC\u2019s Deputy Minister Michael Wernick acknowledged the flaws in the older funding formula and pointed to the new approach:\nWhat we had was a system that basically provided funds for kids in care. So what you got was a lot of kids being taken into care. And the service agencies didn't have the full suite of tools, in terms of kinship care, foster care, placement, diversion, prevention services, and so on. The new approach that we're trying to do through the new partnership agreements provides the agencies with a mix of funding for operating and maintenance--which is basically paying for the kids' needs--and for prevention services, and they have greater flexibility to move between those.\n(2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at pp. 7-8 [footnote omitted])\n[196] Assistant Deputy Minister Christine Cram\u2019s testimony before the Standing Committee echoed that of the Deputy Minister:\nWe currently have two formulas in operation. We have a formula for those provinces where we haven't moved to the new model. Under that formula, we reimburse all charges for kids who are actually in care, and that's why the costs have gone up so dramatically over time. There were comments made about the fact that under the old formula there wasn't funding provided to be able to permit agencies to provide prevention services. That's a fair criticism of the old formula. Under the new formula, as the deputy was mentioning, we have three categories in the funding formula. We have operations, prevention, and maintenance. So those are each determined on a different basis.\n(2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 8 [footnote omitted])\n[197] With regard to the continued application of Directive 20-1 in many provinces and in the Yukon, the Standing Committee expressed concern:\nThe Committee is quite concerned that the majority of First Nations children on reserves continue to live under a funding regime which numerous studies have found is not working and should be changed. According to the Joint National Policy Review, \u201cThe funding formula inherent in Directive 20-1 is not flexible and is outdated.\u201d The 2005 Wen:de report, which undertook a comprehensive review of funding formulae to support First Nations child and family service agencies, found that the current funding formula drastically underfunds primary, secondary and tertiary child maltreatment intervention services, including least disruptive measures. The report writes, \u201cThe lack of early intervention services contributes to the large numbers of First Nations children entering care and staying in care.\u201d An evaluation prepared in 2007 by INAC\u2019s Departmental Audit and Evaluation Branch recommended that INAC, \u201ccorrect the weaknesses in the First Nations Child and Family Service Program\u2019s funding formula.\u201d The OAG concluded, \u201cAs currently designed and implemented, the formula does not treat First Nations or provinces in a consistent or equitable manner. One consequence of this situation is that many on-reserve children and families do not always have access to the child welfare services defined in relevant provincial legislation and available to those living off reserves.\u201d\nYet, this funding formula continues. As the Auditor General puts it, \u201cQuite frankly, one has to ask why a program goes on for 20 years, the world changes around it, and yet the formula stays the same, preventative services aren't funded, and all these children are being put into care.\u201d\nWhile the Committee appreciates the efforts the Department is making to develop new agreements based on the enhanced prevention model, the Committee completely fails to understand why the old funding formula is still in place. Moving to new agreements should in no way preclude making improvements to the existing formula, especially as it may take years to develop agreements with the provinces. In the meantime, many First Nations children are taken into care when other options are available. This is unacceptable and clearly inequitable.\n(2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at pp. 9-10 [footnotes omitted])\n[198] With regard to the new EPFA funding formula, the Standing Committee agreed with the Auditor General\u2019s comments regarding the fact that this new formula does not address the inequities of Directive 20-1 (i.e. the assumptions built into the formula regarding the percentage of first nations children and families in need of care):\nThe Committee could not agree more, especially as the Department has known about this problem in the old formula yet has repeated it in the new formula. The Committee is very disturbed that the Department would take a bureaucratic approach to funding agencies, rather than making efforts to provide funding where it is needed. The result of this approach is that communities that need funding the most, that is, where more than six percent of the children are in care, will continue to be underfunded and will not be able to provide their children the services they need. The Committee strongly believes that INAC needs to develop a funding formula that is flexible enough to provide funding based on need, rather than a fixed percentage.\n(2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 10)\n[199] Finally, with regard to the Auditor General\u2019s finding that AANDC has not analyzed and compared the child welfare services available on reserves with those in neighbouring communities off reserve, the Standing Committee made the following observations:\nNonetheless, it should be possible to compare the level of funding provided to First Nations child and family services agencies to similar provincial agencies, and given their unique and challenging circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect First Nations agencies to receive a higher level of funding. Yet, when asked how the funding for First Nations child and family service agencies compares to agencies for non-natives, the Assistant Deputy Minister said, \u201cI'm sorry, but we don't know the answer.\u201d The same question was put to the Deputy Minister and he replied, \u201cOur accountability is for the services delivered by those agencies to the extent that we fund them.\u201d\nThe Committee finds these responses quite disappointing. The Deputy Minister\u2019s response was unsatisfactory because the issue under discussion is the extent to which the agencies are funded. Also, to not know how the funding compares to provincial agencies makes the Committee wonder how the level of funding is determined, and how the Department can be assured that it is treating First Nations children equitably.\n[\u2026]\nAs the policy requires First Nations child welfare services to be comparable with services provided off reserves and the Committee believes that First Nations children should be treated equitably, the Committee believes that INAC must have comprehensive information about the funding level provided to provincial child welfare agencies and compare that to the funding of First Nations agencies. This does not mean that INAC should adopt provincial funding formulae for First Nations agencies as the needs for First Nations agencies are unique and often greater. Nonetheless, at the very least, INAC should be able to compare funding.\n(2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at pp. 5-6 [footnotes omitted])\n[200] After hearing from the officials of the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and AANDC, including Sheila Fraser, the Auditor General of Canada, Michael Wernick, Deputy Minister of AANDC, and Christine Cram, Assistant Deputy Minister of AANDC, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts made 7 recommendations of its own. Those recommendations include: that AANDC provide a detailed action plan to the Public Accounts Committee on the implementation of the recommendations arising out the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada; that AANDC conduct a comprehensive comparison of its funding under the FNCFS Program to provincial funding of similar agencies; that AANDC immediately modify Directive 20-1 to allow for the funding of enhanced prevention services; that AANDC ensure its funding formula is based upon need rather than an assumed fixed percentage of children in care; that AANDC determine the full costs of meeting all of its policy requirements and develop a funding model to meet those requirements; and, that AANDC develop measures and collect information based on the best interests of children for the results and outcomes of its FNCFS Program (see 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at pp. 4-12).\n[201] In response to the Standing Committee\u2019s report, presented to the House of Commons on August 19, 2009, AANDC generally accepted the recommendations, although with some nuances (see Annex, ex. 19 [AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts]). For example, AANDC generally responded:\nThe Standing Committee on Public Accounts\u2019 recommendations speak to the link between provincial comparability, revising Directive 20-1, moving to a needs based formula and to determining the full costs of the FNCFS Program nationally. This suggests INAC should undertake a one-time simultaneous reform of the program in all provinces. INAC is in fact undertaking similar steps towards reform, however, it is being done province-by-province. Rather than taking a one-size-fits all approach that would overlook community level needs and compromise partnerships and accountability, INAC is addressing provincial comparability, including a needs component in the formula and finalizing the process with a full costing analysis for each jurisdiction. All of this is done at tripartite tables ensuring buy-in by all partners, reasonable comparability with the respective province and sound accountability aimed at achieving positive outcomes for children and their families. As well, INAC is committing to review Directive 20-1.\n(AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at Introduction)\n[202] With regard to the recommendation that AANDC conduct a comprehensive comparison of its funding to provincial funding, AANDC responded:\nINAC agrees with this recommendation on the understanding that a comparative analysis can only be provided with the limited data we have access to and on a phased basis. This review will require a substantial amount of time and work with the provinces and First Nations. The information available in provincial annual reports is general and the funding provided under their children\u2019s services often includes programs beyond child and family services. Overall, these provincial reports do not contain the level of detail required to make the kind of comprehensive comparison expected by the Committee. Relationships must be strengthened with provincial partners as they are key in providing INAC with the necessary information concerning the funding of their child welfare programs. This is what INAC is doing as it proceeds with the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach. Provinces must also agree to allow INAC to make this information available to the public.\nIt should also be noted that due to the complexity of child welfare service delivery across the country, comparability between FNCFS agencies and provincial child welfare providers on-reserve, is challenging. Specifically, child welfare services in the provinces are delivered in a variety of ways. The services can vary by jurisdiction based on need; be provided directly by the province; or by provincially delegated authorities or regional\/districts. A province can also fund agencies to deliver the services and\/or contract third parties.\nTherefore, INAC cannot commit to conducting such a comprehensive review nor can it be done for all jurisdictions by the timelines required by the Committee. INAC would be able to provide a basic comparison of jurisdictions that are currently under the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach and where INAC has basic information on salary rates and caseload ratios. INAC expects to complete this first phase by or before December 31, 2009.\nAs INAC moves forward on transitioning other jurisdictions and as relationships are built with each province at the tripartite tables, INAC will be in a better position to conduct a comparison of funding between FNCFS agencies and provincial systems. This phase will consist of the provinces with whom INAC has not yet developed or completed tripartite accountability frameworks. This phase is expected to be completed by 2012.\n(AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at Recommendation 2 \u2013 Provincial Comparison)\n[203] In response to the recommendation that AANDC revise the funding formula to provide funding based on need, AANDC responded:\nIt is important to note that the 6% average number of children in care calculation is one of many factors used only to model operations funding which includes the number of protection workers. This is then translated into a portion of the operations funding that agency receives. This 6% number was arrived at through discussions with First Nations Agency Directors and provincial representatives, and was thought to be fairly representative of the overall needs of the communities. Under the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach, FNCFS agencies have the flexibility to shift funds from one stream to another in order to meet the specific needs of the community. This costing model provides all FNCFS agencies under the new approach with the necessary resources to offer a greater range of child and family services.\nThrough discussions with provincial and First Nations partners, it is clear that they preferred to create a costing model that would provide recipients stable funding for operations. The majority of partners indicated they would not be supportive of a model that generated more resources for Recipients based upon a higher percentage of children in care. Also, this model ensures that FNCFS agencies supporting communities with lower populations are provided with sufficient funding to operate both prevention and protection programs. Without the fixed percentage formula used to calculate and fund Operations, agencies with a very low percentage of children in care would not have the necessary resources to operate. Moreover, if the operations budget were based upon need rather than a fixed percentage, the agencies could find themselves with widely fluctuating operations budgets year to year which would hamper their ability to plan and provide services. The new costing models provide a stable operating and prevention budget that does not rely on the number of children in care as one of its determinants.\n(AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at Recommendation 5 \u2013 Funding Formula based on Need)\n[204] AANDC\u2019s response to the recommendations of the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts would be revisited in 2011 by the Auditor General.\n2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada\n[205] In 2011, the Auditor General of Canada assessed AANDC\u2019s progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (see Annex, ex. 20 [2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada]).\n[206] With regard to comparability of services, the Auditor General noted that while AANDC had agreed to define what is meant by services that are reasonably comparable, it had not done so. The Auditor General stated that \u201c[u]ntil it does, it is unclear what is the service standard for which the Department is providing funding and what level of services First Nations communities can eventually expect to receive\u201d (see 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at pp. 23-24, s. 4.49). In addition, the Auditor General found AANDC had not conducted a review of social services available in the provinces to assess whether the services provided to children on reserve are the same as what is available to children off reserve (see 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 24, s. 4.49).\n[207] Concerning the new EPFA funding formula, the Auditor General reiterated its previous finding that it did not address all of the funding disparities that were noted in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada. While the Auditor General acknowledged that the EPFA enables additional services beyond those offered by Directive 20-1, it noted that:\nwithout having defined what is meant by comparability, the Department has been unable to demonstrate that its new Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach provides services to children and families living on reserves that are reasonably comparable to provincial services.\n(2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 24, ss. 4.50-4.51)\n[208] With respect to the recommendation that AANDC determine the full costs of meeting the policy requirements of the FNCFS Program, the Department agreed to regularly update the estimated cost of delivering the program with the new EPFA funding approach on a province-by-province basis and to periodically review the program budget. The Auditor General reported that AANDC had identified the costs it would have to pay for services in each province before transitioning to EPFA. AANDC determined that it needed an increase of between 50 and 100% in its funding for operations and prevention services in each of the provinces that transitioned to EPFA. With all cost components taken into consideration, on average, EPFA led to an increase of over 40% in the cost of the FNCFS Program in the participating provinces (see 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at pp. 24-25, ss. 4.53-4.54). In this regard, the Auditor General noted the FNCFS Program budget has increased by 32% since the 2005-2006 fiscal year, partly reflecting the increased funding levels needed to implement EPFA (see 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 25, s. 4.55).\n[209] On the comprehensive comparison of funding to FNCFS Agencies with provincial funding to similar agencies requested by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the Auditor General reported that AANDC had compared some elements of child and family services programs on and off reserve, such as social workers\u2019 salaries and benefits in preparation for framework negotiations with the provinces. However, AANDC did not provide any information about social workers\u2019 caseloads, stating that it is not public information. In addition, AANDC asserted certain services provided by the provinces, such as services related to health issues and youth justice, were not within AANDC\u2019s mandate (see 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at p. 25, ss. 4.56- 4.57).\n[210] In general, the Auditor General\u2019s review of programs for First Nations on reserves, including its follow-up on the status of AANDC\u2019s progress in addressing some of the recommendations from the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, was as follows:\nDespite the federal government\u2019s many efforts to implement our recommendations and improve its First Nations programs, we have seen a lack of progress in improving the lives and well-being of people living on reserves. Services available on reserves are often not comparable to those provided off reserves by provinces and municipalities. Conditions on reserves have remained poor. Change is needed if First Nations are to experience more meaningful outcomes from the services they receive. We recognize that the issues are complex and that solutions will require concerted efforts of the federal government and First Nations, in collaboration with provincial governments and other parties.\nWe believe that there have been structural impediments to improvements in living conditions on First Nations reserves. In our opinion, real improvement will depend on clarity about service levels, a legislative base for programs, commensurate statutory funding instead of reliance on policy and contribution agreements, and organizations that support service delivery by First Nations. All four are needed before conditions on reserves will approach those existing elsewhere across Canada. There needs to be stronger emphasis on achieving results.\nWe recognize that the federal government cannot put all of these structural changes in place by itself since they would fundamentally alter its relationship with First Nations. For this reason, First Nations themselves would have to play an important role in bringing about the changes. They would have to become actively engaged in developing service standards and determining how the standards will be monitored and enforced. They would have to fully participate in the development of legislative reforms. First Nations would also have to co-lead discussions on identifying credible funding mechanisms that are administratively workable and that ensure accountable governance within their communities. First Nations would have to play an active role in the development and administration of new organizations to support the local delivery of services to their communities.\nAddressing these structural impediments will be a challenge. The federal government and First Nations will have to work together and decide how they will deal with numerous obstacles that surely lie ahead. Unless they rise to this challenge, however, living conditions may continue to be poorer on First Nations reserves than elsewhere in Canada for generations to come.\n(2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada at pp. 5-6)\n2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts\n[211] In February 2012, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts issued a report following the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada (see Annex, ex. 21 [2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts]).\n[212] Deputy Minister of AANDC, Michael Wernick, testified before the Committee and \u201c\u2026agreed, without reservation, with the OAG\u2019s diagnosis of the problem\u2026\u201d (2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 3). Mr. Wernick stated to the Committee:\nOne of the really important parts of the Auditor General's report is that it shows there are four missing conditions. The combination of those is what's likely to result in an enduring change. You could pick any one of them, such as legislation without funding, or funding without legislation, and so on. They would have some results, but they would probably, in our view, be temporary. If you want enduring, structural changes, it's the combination of these tools.\u201d He also said, \u201cWith all due respect, I want to send the message that, if Parliament demands better results, it has to provide us with better tools.\n(2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 3 [footnotes omitted])\n[213] With specific regard to the FNCFS Program, the Deputy Minister stated:\nWe have fixed the funding formula. We make sure resources are available for prevention services. And we've put in place these kinds of tripartite agreements, because these are creatures of the provincial child protection statutes. In six of the provinces, I think it is, we have $100 million or more in funding over several budgets. They go at the pace at which we can conclude agreements with the provinces--I can certainly provide the list--but we're now covering about 68% of first nations kids with this prevention approach.\n(2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 9 [footnote omitted])\n[214] The Standing Committee concluded its report with the following statements:\nThe Committee notes that the government is taking a number of concrete actions to improve conditions for First Nations on reserves, and the Deputy Minister of AANDC expressed his commitment to address the structural impediments identified by the OAG. Like the Deputy Minister, the Committee is optimistic that progress can be made, but it will require significant structural reforms and sustained management attention. The Committee believes that AANDC, in coordination with other departments, needs to develop and commit to a plan of action to take the necessary steps, and the Committee intends to monitor the government\u2019s progress to ensure that First Nations on reserves experience meaningful improvements in their social and economic conditions.\n(2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at p. 12)\n[215] The then Minister of AANDC, Mr. John Duncan, responded to the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (see Annex, ex. 22 [AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts]). Of note, Minister Duncan acknowledged the following:\nI would also like to acknowledge the work of the Office of the Auditor General in providing Parliament, the Government of Canada, and Canadians with valuable insights into Canada\u2019s approach to program delivery for First Nations on reserves. I consider the six-page preface to Chapter 4 of the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada to be an important roadmap for Parliament in moving forward on First Nation issues.\n[\u2026]\nI agree that many of the problems faced by First Nations are due to the structural impediments identified \u2013 the lack of clarity about service levels, lack of a legislative base, lack of an appropriate funding mechanism, and a lack of organizations to support local service delivery.\n[\u2026]\nThrough the Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach for First Nations Child and Family Services clarity about service levels and comparability of services and funding levels have been addressed at tripartite tables with the six provinces that have transitioned to the new approach.\n[\u2026]\nThe Office of the Auditor General observed that there are challenges associated with the use of contribution agreements to fund programs and services for First Nations. For instance, agreements may not always focus on service standards or the results to be achieved; agreements must be renewed yearly and it is often unclear who is accountable to First Nations members for achieving improved outcomes. In addition, contribution agreements involve a significant reporting burden, and communities often have to use scarce administrative resources to respond to the numerous reporting requirements stipulated in their contribution agreements.\nThe Government of Canada recognizes that reliance on annual funding agreements and multiple accountabilities when funding is received from multiple sources can impede the provision of timely services and can limit the ability of First Nations to implement longer term development plans.\nTo address these concerns, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada is implementing a risk-based approach to streamlining funding agreements, and reporting requirements. The General Assessment tool supports increased flexibility by assessing the capacity of recipients to access a wider range of funding approaches, including multi-year funding agreements. In addition, a pilot initiative with 11 First Nations communities is currently being implemented using a new approach to reporting which is increasing transparency and accountability at the community level by using the First Nations website as a reporting tool and addressing capacity issues created by the reporting burden.\n(AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts)\n[216] The NPR, Wen:De reports and the Auditor General and the Standing Committee reports all have identified shortcomings in the funding and structure of the FNCFS Program. This was further demonstrated in other evidence presented to the Tribunal and to which the Panel will return to below. First, however, we will outline the evidence advanced with regard to the funding of child and family services under the 1965 Agreement in Ontario, along with the other provincial agreements in Alberta and British Columbia.\nc. 1965 Agreement in Ontario\n[217] There is also evidence indicating shortcomings in the funding and structure of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario.\n[218] In 1965, the federal government entered into an agreement with the Province of Ontario to enable social services, including child and family services, to be extended to First Nations communities on reserve. Around the same time, child welfare authorities in Ontario began the large-scale removal of Aboriginal children from their homes and communities, commonly referred to as part of the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d. Ms. Theresa Stevens, Executive Director for Anishinaabe Abinoojii Family Services in Kenora, Ontario, described how buses would drive into communities and take all the children away (see Transcript Vol. 25 at pp. 28-30). As will be explained in more detail below, the collective trauma experienced by many First Nations in Ontario as a result of the Sixties Scoop informs the climate for the provision of child and family services in the province. The Panel acknowledges the suffering of Aboriginal children, families and communities as a result of the Sixties Scoop.\n[219] The 1965 Agreement is a cost-sharing agreement where Ontario provides or pays for eligible services up front and invoices Canada for a share of the costs of those services pursuant to a cost-sharing formula. Eligible services for cost sharing under the 1965 Agreement are described in its Schedules. Mr. Phil Digby, Manager of Social Programs at AANDC\u2019s Ontario Regional Office, testified at the hearing and explained how the 1965 Agreement works. At the beginning of each fiscal year, Ontario provides AANDC with a cash flow forecast. Once approved, AANDC provides Ontario with a one-month cash advance, followed by monthly instalments. There is a 10% holdback on the payments, which is paid out (with any adjustments) at the end of the year after an audit. There is no overall cap on expenditures under the 1965 Agreement.\n[220] The cost-sharing formula is set out at clause 3 of the 1965 Agreement and is based on two elements: the \u201cper capita cost of the Financial Assistance Component of the Aggregate Ontario Welfare Program provided to persons other than Indians with Reserve Status in Ontario\u201d; and, the \u201cper capita cost of the Financial Assistance Component of the Aggregate Ontario Welfare Program provided to Indians with Reserve Status in Ontario\u201d.\n[221] According to Mr. Digby, social assistance is the area where there was the best data that gave a good proxy for the proportionate share of costs and relative share of costs in First Nations communities vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of Ontario. As of 2011-12 the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living off reserve was approximately $200. For First Nations living on reserve it was about $1,200. AANDC\u2019s share of the costs is calculated by taking 50% of the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living off reserve (200 x 0.50 = 100) and dividing it by the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living on reserve (100\/1200 = 0.0833); subtracting the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living off reserve from the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living on reserve (1200 \u2013 200 = 1000) and dividing that amount by the average cost of providing social assistance to persons living on reserve (1000\/1200 = 0.8333); and then, adding those two numbers together to arrive at the cost-sharing ratio (0.0833 + 0.8333 = 0.9166). Pursuant to these numbers, AANDC paid approximately 92% of the eligible costs under the 1965 Agreement in 2011-12. According to Mr. Digby, the 1965 Agreement cost-sharing formula recognizes the higher per capita costs of providing social assistance to First Nations on reserves and AANDC\u2019s agreement to take the financial responsibility for these additional costs (see testimony of P. Digby, Transcript Vol. 59 at pp. 24-28).\n[222] There are two mechanisms used by the province of Ontario to provide child welfare services on reserve: (i) child welfare societies, including provincial child welfare agencies and FNCFS Agencies; and (ii) service contracts for prevention services. There are seven fully-mandated FNCFS Agencies in Ontario and they are funded according to the same funding model as provincial child welfare agencies in Ontario. There are also six pre-mandated FNCFS Agencies who do not have a full protection mandate and are in the process of developing their capacity to become fully-mandated FNCFS Agencies. There are also approximately 25 First Nations reserves that receive prevention services via service contract.\n[223] The 1965 Agreement has never undergone a formal review by AANDC. The sections of the agreement dealing with child and family services have not been updated since 1981, and the Schedules to the agreement have not been updated since 1998. This is significant given in 1984 Ontario implemented the Child and Family Services Act, which incorporated elements from other pieces of legislation (for example, youth justice and mental health) to address the child and family services needs of Ontarians. At that time, the Government of Canada took the position that AANDC did not have the mandate or resources to start funding justice and health programs, as those types of programs would fall under a different department (see testimony of P. Digby, Transcript Vol. 59 at p. 69).\n[224] In 2000, the NPR recommended a tripartite review be done of the 1965 Agreement (see at pp. 18 and 121). The 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada also noted that there are provisions in the 1965 Agreement to keep it up-to-date and that they could be used to ensure both the 1965 Agreement and the services that the federal government pays for are current.\n[225] The fact that the 1965 Agreement has not been kept up-to-date with Ontario\u2019s Child and Families Services Act was highlighted by Mr. Digby in a 2007 discussion paper (see Annex, ex. 23 [1965 Agreement Overview]). The Panel finds the 1965 Agreement Overview document to be relevant and reliable, especially given Mr. Digby\u2019s involvement in its authorship. According to the 1965 Agreement Overview discussion paper, at page 4, issues raised by various stakeholders with regard to the 1965 Agreement and its implementation include:\nConcern that the agreement is bilateral, not tripartite, since First Nations were not asked to be signatories in 1965. While clause 2.2 of the 1965 Agreement indicates that bands are to signify concurrence to the extension of provincial welfare programs, this does not reflect the type of intergovernmental relationship sought by many First Nations.\n[\u2026]\nFirst Nations and the provincial government have, from time to time, expressed interest in INAC cost-sharing additional provincial social service programs to be extended on reserve. INAC has generally not had the resources to \u2018open up\u2019 new areas for cost-sharing. [\u2026] There has been no update to the agreement schedule with regard to cost-sharing child welfare. As several programs within the provincial Child and Family Services Act (CFSA) fall outside of INAC\u2019s mandate, the department is not in a position to \u2018open up\u2019 discussion on cost-sharing the full CFSA.\n[226] In 2011, the Commission to Promote Sustainable Child Welfare (the CPSCW) prepared a discussion paper regarding Aboriginal child welfare in Ontario (see Annex, ex. 24 [CPSCW Discussion Paper]). The CPSCW was created by the Minister of Children and Youth Services in Ontario to develop and implement solutions to ensure the sustainability of child welfare. It reports to the Minister thereon. In light of this public mandate, the Panel finds the discussion paper relevant and reliable to the issue of the provision of child and family services to First Nations on reserve in Ontario.\n[227] The CPSCW Discussion Paper, at page 4, begins by noting the impact of history on many Aboriginal communities:\nThe combination of colonization, residential schools, the Sixties Scoop, and other factors have undermined Aboriginal cultures, eroded parenting capacity, and challenged economic self-sufficiency. Many Aboriginal people live in communities that experience high levels of poverty, alcohol and substance abuse, suicides, incarceration rates, unemployment rates, and other social problems. Aboriginal children are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system and in the youth justice system. Suicide rates for Aboriginal children and youth surpass those of non-Aboriginals by approximately five times. Aboriginal youth are 9 times more likely to be pregnant before age 18, far less likely to complete high school, far more likely to live in poverty, and far more likely to suffer from emotional disorders and addictions.\n[228] Despite these specific risk factors for Aboriginal peoples, the CPSCW Discussion Paper notes that many provincial child welfare agencies give little attention to the requirements for providing services to Aboriginal children set out in Ontario\u2019s Child and Families Services Act (see at p. 26). Specifically, the discussion paper points to sections 213 and 213.1 of the Child and Families Services Act whereby a society or agency that provides services with respect to First Nations children must regularly consult with the child\u2019s band or community, usually through a Band Representative, about the provision of the services, including the apprehension of children and the placement of children in care; the provision of family support services; and, the preparation of plans for the care of children.\n[229] According to the CPSCW Discussion Paper, Band Representatives can be crucial and tend to fulfill the following functions: serving as the main liaison between a Band and Children\u2019s Aid Societies [CASs]; providing cultural training and advice to CASs; monitoring Temporary Care Agreements and Voluntary Service Agreements with CASs; securing access to legal resources; attending and participating in court proceedings; ensuring that the cultural needs of a child are being addressed by the CAS; and, participating in the development of a child\u2019s plan of care (see at p. 26).\n[230] The CPSCW Discussion Paper indicates that, in the past, First Nations were funded on a claims basis by the federal government to hire a Band Representative. However, since 2003, that funding was discontinued. Therefore, some First Nations divert resources from prevention services to cover the cost of a Band Representative, while others simply do not have one (see CPSCW Discussion Paper at p. 26).\n[231] Providing child welfare services in remote and isolated Northern Ontario communities was also identified by the CPSCW Discussion Paper as a challenge for CASs. Those challenges include the added time and expense to travel to the communities they serve, where some communities do not have year round road access and where flying-in can be the only option for accessing a community. In fact, one agency was required to make up to 80 flights in a day.\n[232] Another challenge for remote and isolated communities is recruiting and retaining staff, especially qualified staff from the community. The legacy of the Sixties Scoop and the association of CASs with the removal of children from the community have caused some First Nations community members to resent or resist CAS workers and can create a hostile working environment.\n[233] Other challenges for remote and isolated communities are a lack of suitable housing, which makes it difficult to hire staff from outside the community and to find suitable foster homes; limited access to court; and, the lack of other health and social programs, which impacts the performance and quality of child and family services (see CPSCW Discussion Paper at pp. 28-29). On this last point, the CPSCW Discussion Paper emphasizes that \u201c[p]romoting positive outcomes for children, families and communities, requires a full range of services related to the health, social, and economic conditions of the community: child welfare services alone are not nearly enough\u201d (at p. 29).\n[234] The CPSCW Discussion Paper also notes that there are many distinct differences between designated Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal CASs: they serve significantly larger and less inhabited geographic areas with lower child and youth populations, they have significantly larger case volumes per thousand, they serve more of their children and youth in care versus in their own homes, and they have smaller total expenditures, but significantly higher expenditures per capita and higher expenditures per case (see CPSCW Discussion Paper at p. 29).\n[235] Finally, in discussing the federal-provincial dynamics of providing child and family services on reserve, the CPSCW Discussion Paper comments that instead of working collaboratively towards providing effective service delivery to Aboriginal peoples, the federal government has devolved some of its responsibilities for Aboriginal peoples to the provincial governments, which contributes to some confusion over ultimate jurisdiction (see CPSCW Discussion Paper at pp. 34-35).\n[236] On this last point, in 2007 the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services wrote to AANDC expressing their concern over AANDC\u2019s decision to no longer provide funding for Band Representatives: \u201cwith the withdrawal of federal funding, many First Nations do not have the financial resources required to participate in planning for Indian and native children involved with a children\u2019s aid society or to take part in child protection legal proceedings\u201d (Annex, ex. 25 at p. 2).\n[237] In 2011, the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services again wrote to AANDC on the issue of funding for Band Representatives:\nThe paramount purpose of the CFSA is to \u201cpromote the best interests, protection and well-being of children.\u201d The band representative function supports not only the purpose of the Act but also the other important purposes and provisions to which the Act pertains. A lack of sufficient capacity within First Nation communities limits their ability to respond effectively and in accordance with legislated times frames for action. The withdrawal of [INAC\u2019s] funding for band representation functions has eroded First Nations\u2019 ability to participate as intended in the CFSA.\n(Annex, ex. 26 at p. 2)\n[238] Despite the discordance between Ontario\u2019s Child and Families Services Act and AANDC\u2019s policy to no longer fund Band Representatives, Minister Duncan indicated that \u201cit falls within the responsibilities of First Nation governments to determine their level of engagement in child welfare matters\u201d and \u201cwe do not foresee the Government of Canada providing funding support in this area\u201d (Annex, ex. 27 at p.1).\n[239] Ambiguity surrounding jurisdiction for the provision of mental health services to First Nations youth has also been a cause for concern. When the Anishinaabe Abinoojii Family Services agency sought a mandate to provide children\u2019s mental health services, an AANDC employee prepared a document to provide information to the Regional Director General and Assistant Regional Directors General on the issue (see Annex, ex. 28 [Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate]). The Executive Director for Anishinaabe Abinoojii Family Services, Ms. Stevens, testified as to the content of the document (see Transcript Vol. 25 at pp. 174-178).\n[240] According to the Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate document, there are waiting lists for First Nations children served by the Abinoojii Family Services agency who require mental health services. The document adds that while there is some cooperation between mental health service organizations and the Abinoojii agency to manage these waiting lists, there is also a need for more resources and culturally appropriate assessment tools and counsellors. The Ministry of Children and Youth Services has a Mental Health Policy for Children and Youth and has some resources for mental health counselling, but the needs outstrip the funding (see Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate at pp. 1-2).\n[241] In considering the request, the Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate document states that AANDC does not have a mandate for mental health services and that these expenditures are not eligible under the 1965 Agreement. Rather, Health Canada has the federal mandate on mental health and provides funding through a number of programs. However, those programs focus more on prevention and mostly deal with adult issues. Health Canada programs do not specifically deal with children in care and do not cover mental health counselling (see Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate at p. 2).\n[242] In a roundtable meeting between Abinoojii Family Services agency, AANDC, Health Canada and the Ministry of Children and Youth Services for Ontario, Health Canada recognized a need to look at the whole system as services\/programs tend to work in silos and raised the possibility of re-prioritizing resources or seeking additional funding. AANDC indicated that the province is the lead on child welfare and Health Canada is the lead on health issues at the federal level, but that it supports the work on examining existing programs, outlining gaps and working together to ensure First Nations receive services that are comparable and culturally appropriate (see Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate at p. 2).\n[243] In 2012, the Ontario Association of Children\u2019s Aid Societies (the OACAS) produced a report regarding trends in child welfare in Ontario, including in Aboriginal communities (see Annex, ex. 29 [Child Welfare Report]). The OACAS is an advocacy group representing the interests of 45 CASs member organizations. Governed by a voluntary board of directors, OACAS consults with and advises the provincial government on issues of legislation, regulation, policy, standards and review mechanisms. It promotes and is dedicated to achieving the best outcomes for children and families (see Child Welfare Report at p. 2). Given the OACAS\u2019s mandate and focus, the Panel finds its report relevant and reliable.\n[244] According to the Child Welfare Report, the current funding model does not reflect the needs of Aboriginal communities and agencies for several reasons including: insufficient resources for services, where they tend to be crisis driven; shortage of funding for administrative requirements; lack of funding to establish infrastructure necessary to deliver statutory child protection services, while operating within the extraordinary infrastructure deficits of many of the communities they serve; and, insufficient funds to retain qualified staff to deliver culturally appropriate services (at p. 7). Among other things, at page 7 of the Child Welfare Report, the OACAS asked the Ontario government to:\nEstablish an Aboriginal child welfare funding model and adequate funding to support culturally appropriate programs that encompass the unique experiences of diverse Aboriginal populations \u2013 on-reserve, off-reserve, remote, rural, and urban. Invest in capacity building to enable the proper recruitment, training and retention of child welfare professionals in emerging Aboriginal Children\u2019s Aid Societies.\n[245] In terms of infrastructure and capacity building, the 1965 Agreement has not provided for the cost-sharing of capital expenditures since 1975 (see testimony of P. Digby, Transcript Vol. 59 at p. 93). Ms. Stevens explained the impact of this on her organization: many high-risk children are sent outside the community to receive services because there is no treatment centre in the community. Abinoojii Family Services spends approximately 2 to 3 million a year sending children outside their community. According to Ms. Stevens, there are not enough resources to build a treatment centre or develop programs to assist these high-risk children because those funds are expended on meeting the current needs of those children (see Transcript Vol. 25 at p. 32).\n[246] Again, the above evidence on the 1965 Agreement identifies shortcomings in AANDC\u2019s approach to the provision of child and family services on First Nations reserves in Ontario. In the provision of child and family services, the Panel finds the situation in Ontario falls short of the objective of the 1965 Agreement\u201c\u2026to make available to the Indians in the Province the full range of provincial welfare programs\u201d.\nd. Other provincial\/territorial agreements\n[247] As mentioned above, two other provinces have agreements with AANDC for the provision of child and family services on reserve: Alberta and British Columbia. While in the Yukon, the Yukon Funding Agreement applies.\n[248] As mentioned above, the Yukon Funding Agreement applies to all First Nations children and families ordinarily resident in the Territory. Schedule \u201cDIAND-3\u201d of the Yukon Funding Agreement provides for the application of Directive 20-1 to the funding of child and family services to those First Nations children and families.\n[249] In Alberta and British Columbia, AANDC reimburses the provinces for the delivery of child and family services to certain First Nations communities on reserve where there are no FNCFS Agencies. In Alberta, six First Nations communities are served by the Alberta Reform Agreement for child and family services. In British Columbia, seventy-two First Nation communities receive services under the BC Service Agreement.\n[250] Pursuant to the Alberta Reform Agreement, AANDC reimburses Alberta for the costs of providing various social services, including child welfare services, to certain First Nations reserves in the province. For those child welfare services, funding is provided at the beginning of the fiscal year based on a funding formula using year-end costs of the preceding fiscal year. Adjustments are made based on actual expenditures during the fiscal year (see Alberta Reform Agreement at Schedule A, s. 1).\n[251] In British Columbia, the BC MOU was in place from 1996 to 2012. Under the BC MOU, AANDC reimbursed the province for eligible maintenance expenses based on a per diem formula which accounted for the province\u2019s administration, supervision and maintenance costs (see BC MOU at s. 5.0; and Appendix B and D). The per diem rates could be adjusted annually and the province could receive an adjustment to the previous year\u2019s per diem rates based on actual expenditures (see BC MOU at Appendix C). Those adjustments included rate increases based on inflation and increased emphasis on prevention services. For the fiscal year 2006\/2007, the recalculation of per diem rates resulted in an invoice to AANDC for over $5 million dollars (see Annex, ex. 30).\n[252] In 2012, the BC MOU was replaced by the BC Service Agreement. The BC Service Agreement now provides for reimbursement of maintenance expenses based on actual expenditures. It also provides funding to the province for operations expenses based on a costing model agreed to between the province and AANDC (see BC Service Agreement at s. 7; and Appendix A). For fiscal year 2012-2013, operations funding amounted to $15 million.\n[253] The Alberta Reform Agreement, the BC MOU and the BC Service Agreement provide reimbursement for actual eligible operating and administrative expenditures, including retroactive adjustments for inflation and increases for changes in programming. This is quite different from FNCFS Agencies in those provinces, including under the EPFA in Alberta, where there is no such adjustments for those types of increases in costs (see testimony of C. Schimanke, Transcript Vol. 62 at pp. 53-54). As expressed in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada at page 19, these adjustments and reimbursements for actuals are linked directly to provincial child welfare legislation:\n4.49 INAC funds some provinces for delivering child welfare services directly where First Nations do not. INAC has agreements with three of the five provinces we covered on how they will be funded to provide child welfare services on reserves. We found that in these provinces, INAC reimburses all or an agreed-on share of their operating and administrative costs of delivering child welfare services directly to First Nations and of the costs of children placed in care. [\u2026]\n4.50 INAC funding to cover the costs of operating and administering First Nations agencies is established through a formula. Although the program requires First Nations agencies to meet applicable provincial legislation, we found that INAC\u2019s funding formula is not linked to this requirement. The main element of the formula is the number of children aged from 0 to 18 who are ordinarily resident on the reserve or reserves being served by a First Nations agency. [\u2026]\n[254] The Panel will return to this comparison in the section that follows.\niii. AANDC\u2019s position on the evidence\n[255] AANDC argues the evidence above is not sufficient to establish adverse treatment in the provision of funding for First Nations child and family services, including that there is a lack of specific examples to support the allegation of a denial of such services. In sum, it claims the reports and evidence regarding the FNCFS Program above should be given little weight, that the choices of FNCFS Agencies in administering their budgets should be considered in evaluating any adverse impacts, along with any additional funding they receive beyond Directive 20-1 or the EPFA, that comparing the federal and provincial\/territorial funding systems is not a valid comparison under the CHRA, and, even if it were, such comparative evidence is lacking in this case. Each argument is addressed below.\na. The relevance and reliability of the studies on the FNCFS Program\n[256] AANDC views the various studies of the FNCFS Program outlined above as having little weight. It questions the comprehensiveness of the studies, noting the experience of a few agencies does not establish differential treatment.\n[257] The Panel finds the NPR and Wen:De reports to be highly relevant and reliable evidence in this case. They are studies of the FNCFS Program commissioned jointly by AANDC and the AFN. They employed a rigorous methodology, in depth analysis of Directive 20-1, and consultations with various stakeholders. The Panel accepts the findings in these reports. There is no indication that AANDC questioned the findings of these reports prior to this Complaint. On the contrary, there are indications that AANDC, in fact, relied on these reports in amending the FNCFS Program.\n[258] In its October 2006 Fact Sheet (see Annex, ex. 10), AANDC acknowledged the impacts and findings of the Wen:De reports, along with the NPR, and committed to refocusing the FNCFS Program to improve outcomes for First Nations children and families on reserve:\nCurrently, Program funding is largely based on protection services, which encourage Agencies to remove First Nation children from their parental homes, rather than providing prevention services, which could allow children to remain safely in their homes.\n\u00b7 Program expenditures were $417 million in 2005-2006 and are expected to grow to $540 million by 2010-11 if the program continues to operate under the protection-based model.\n\u00b7 From 1996-97 to 2004-05, the number of First Nation children in care increased by 64.34%.\n\u00b7 Approximately 5.8% of First Nation children living on reserve are in care out of their parental homes.\nCurrent Issues: First Nation children are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system. Placement rates on reserve reflect a lack of available prevention services to mitigate family crisis.\n[\u2026]\nChanges in the landscape: Provinces and territories have introduced new policy approaches to child welfare and a broader continuum of services and programs that First Nations Child and Family Services must deliver to retain their provincial mandates as service providers. However, the current federal funding approach to child and family services has not let First Nations Child and Family Services Agencies keep pace with the provincial and territorial policy changes, and therefore, the First Nations Child and Family Services Agencies are unable to deliver the full continuum of services offered by the provinces and territories to other Canadians. A fundamental change in the funding approach of First Nations Child and Family Services Agencies to child welfare is required in order to reverse the growth rate of children coming into care, and in order for the agencies to meet their mandated responsibilities.\nThe Future: A Joint National Policy Review on First Nations Child and Family Services, completed in 2000, recommended that the federal government increase prevention services for children at risk-services that must be provided before considering the removal of the child and placement in out of home care-and that it provide adequate funding for this purpose.\n\u00b7 Indian and Northern Affairs Canada funded research undertaken by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada in 2004 and 2005. The reports: WEN: DE: We are coming to the light of day, and WEN: DE: The journey continues, included recommendations for investments and policy adjustments required to address the shortcomings of the current system. This research will form the basis of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\u2019s request for investments and policy renewal.\n[\u2026]\n\u00b7 The Government of Canada is committed to working with First Nations, provincial\/territorial, and federal partners and agencies to implement a modernized vision of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program, a program that strives for safe and strong children and youth supported by healthy parents.\n\u00b7 The strategy is to refocus the program from a protection-based approach towards a preventive-based model, promote a variety of care options to provide children and youth with safe, nurturing and permanent homes, and build on partnerships and implement practical solutions to improve child interventions services.\n[259] Ms. Murphy and Ms. D\u2019Amico also testified about AANDC\u2019s reliance on the NPR and Wen:De reports in implementing the EPFA (see Transcript Vol. 53 at pp. 46-47; and, Vol. 54 at pp. 50-51).\n[260] Internal AANDC documents presented at the hearing also support the department\u2019s adherence to the findings in the NPR and Wen:De reports. AANDC submits the Panel should rely on the testimony of its witnesses rather than what is found in internal documents, given that many of the authors did not testify before the Tribunal in order to provide context and the documents may merely reflect the opinion of employees at a specific time. Therefore, AANDC submits that the Tribunal should assess the weight of documents contextually, with reference to oral evidence regarding their proper interpretation, and considering the scope of the author\u2019s authority to prepare the document in question.\n[261] The Panel has considered these arguments in weighing the evidence and finds the documents relied upon below to be straightforward and clear. Many of these documents are presentations prepared for, or delivered to, high level AANDC officials. The Panel finds these presentations highly relevant and reliable given they are the means by which information on the FNCFS Program is provided to AANDC management, including Deputy or Assistant Deputy Ministers, in order to inform policy decisions or future requests to Cabinet (see Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 159, 166; and, Vol. 55 at p. 199). Furthermore, the other AANDC documents referred to below corroborate the information found in those presentations.\n[262] A 2005 presentation to the \u2018Policy Committee\u2019 refers to the NPR by stating: \u201c[a] 2000 review of FNCFS found that Indian Affairs was funding [FNCFS Agencies] 22% less, on average, than their provincial counterparts\u201d (see Annex, ex. 31 at p. 2 [Policy Committee presentation]). The Policy Committee presentation, at page 3, goes on to state that, despite maintenance expenditures increasing by 7% to 10% annually, the Department only receives a 2% annual adjustment to the departmental budget. According to the Policy Committee presentation at page 3, \u201c[a]dditional investments are now required for further stabilization for basic supports with respect to Enhanced Organizational Support, and Maintenance Volume Growth.\u201d\n[263] The 2005 Policy Committee presentation also indicates FNCFS Agencies are threatening to withdraw from service delivery because they cannot deliver provincially mandated services within their current budgets. The presentation continues by stating that provincial governments have written to the Minister of AANDC indicating their concern that the department is not providing sufficient funding to permit FNCFS Agencies to meet provincial statutory obligations. As a result, the Policy Committee presentation warns that provinces may refuse to renew the mandates of FNCFS Agencies or give mandates to new agencies (see at p. 4).\n[264] In line with the NPR and Wen:De reports, the Policy Committee presentation states: \u201cIn addition to enhanced basic supports for First Nation Child and Family Services, fundamental change in the approach to child welfare is required in order to reverse the growth rate of children coming into care\u201d (at p. 5). In this regard, the presentation proposes transformative measures be put in place to allow investment in prevention services according to provincial legislation and standards (see at p. 6). This \u201c[e]nables the availability of a full spectrum of culturally-appropriate programs and services that would eventually reduce the over representation of First Nations children in the child welfare system\u201d (Policy Committee presentation at p. 6). It also \u201c\u2026addresses immediate critical funding pressures and would stabilize the child welfare situation on reserve\u201d (Policy Committee presentation at p. 6). Finally, according to the Policy Committee presentation, \u201c[i]ncreasing the budget for basic services would enable [FNCFS Agencies] to retain and train staff and meet the increased costs of maintaining operations (e.g. cost of living adjustment, legal fees, insurance, remoteness)\u201d (at p. 6).\n[265] Similarly, in another document entitled \u201cFirst Nations Child and Family Services (FNCFS) Q\u2019s and A\u2019s\u201d, it states:\nCircumstances are dire. Inadequate resources may force individual agencies to close down if their mandates are withdrawn, or not extended by the provinces. This would result in provinces taking over responsibility for child welfare, likely at a higher cost to Indian and Norther Affairs Canada.\n[\u2026]\nOver the past decade the trend in child welfare has been towards prevention or least disruptive measures. INAC recognizes that the current funding formula is not flexible enough to follow this trend and needs to be revised. [\u2026]INAC received authority in 2004-2005 to implement a Flexible Funding Option for Maintenance resources. This will permit some agencies to reprofile Maintenance resources to allow for greater flexibility in how these funds are utilized by placing greater emphasis on prevention services.\nIncremental Operations funding will assist agencies to a very limited extent in providing additional prevention services. Additional Operations resources will assist agencies in coping with funding pressures resulting from increased legal fees, insurance costs and other operational expenses that have not been adjusted for since Program Review was implemented in 1994-1995.\n(Annex, ex. 32 at pp. 1-2, 5)\n[266] Similarly, the 2005 National Program Manual, at page 14, section 2.2.3, outlines some of the cost pressures experienced by FNCFS Agencies in terms of their operational funding:\nAlthough the authorities are clear on what to be included in the operations formula, First Nations have expressed a concern that because the formula was developed in the late 1980's, legislation, standards and practices have changed significantly. Although the following items are included in the Operations, First Nations have stated that Recipients are under increasing pressures due to changes over time with respect to:\n\u00b7 Information Technology: In the late 1980's, use of computers was limited. Today, however, they are vital to operating social programs and services.\n\u00b7 Prevention (Least disruptive measures): Recent trends in provincial and territorial legislation have placed a greater emphasis on prevention. Although prevention resources were included in the current formula, the level of funding may not provide enough resources to meet current needs.\n\u00b7 Liability Insurance: As with prevention, the Operations formula includes funding for insurance. However, since September 11, 2001 (9\/11) insurance costs have increased dramatically.\n\u00b7 Legal Costs: Although legal costs are included in the Operations formula, they have become a larger issue than planned for when the formula was developed. A higher incidence of contested cases plus changes in provincial practice requiring cases to be presented by legal representatives rather than social workers has resulted in higher costs. Further, litigation on behalf of injured children can be very expensive, even when adequate liability insurance is carried.\nIt is anticipated that the review of the Operational formula will address these issues. At the present time, however, the current authorities must be applied.\n(Emphasis added)\n[267] In another document dealing with AANDC\u2019s expenditures on Social Development Programs on reserves it states that, despite the federal government acting as a province in the provision of social development programs on reserve, federal policy for social programs has not kept pace with provincial proactive measures and thus perpetuates the cycle of dependency (see Annex, ex. 33 at pp. 1-2 [Explanations on Expenditures of Social Development Programs document]). The document describes AANDC\u2019s social programs as \u201c\u2026limited in scope and not designed to be as effective as they need to be to create positive social change or meet basic needs in some circumstances\u201d (Explanations on Expenditures of Social Development Programs document at p. 2). It goes on to say that if its current social programs were administered by the provinces this would result in a significant increase in costs for AANDC. The document provides the example of the Kasohkowew Child Wellness Society in Alberta, where it would cost an additional $2.2 million beyond what AANDC currently funds if social services on that reserve reverted back to the province of Alberta (see Explanations on Expenditures of Social Development Programs document at p. 2).\n[268] Correspondingly, a 2006 presentation regarding AANDC social programs on reserves, including the FNCFS Program, describes those programs as being remedial in focus, not always meeting provincial\/territorial rates and standards, and not well-integrated across jurisdictions (see Annex, ex. 34 at p. 5 [Social Programs presentation]). With specific regard to the FNCFS Program, the presentation states that \u201cefforts have been concentrated on child protection and removal of the child from the parental home with the result that the children in care rate continues to increase\u201d (see Social Programs presentation at p. 5).\n[269] In general, the Social Programs presentation states that \u201c[m]any First Nation and Inuit children and families are not receiving services reasonably comparable to those provided to other Canadians\u201d (at p. 3). Relatedly, the presentation notes that \u201c[p]rovinces\/territories have been critical of [AANDC] funding levels as they do not enable First Nation service providers to meet the standards stipulated in provincial\/territorial legislation\u201d (Social Programs presentation at p. 6). According to the presentation, the delivery of social programs on reserves is hampered by the absence of legislation, inadequate funding and a division of responsibilities between federal departments which impedes comprehensive program responses (see Social Programs presentation at p. 3).\n[270] In another presentation, AANDC describes Directive 20-1 as \u201cbroken\u201d:\nThe current system is BROKEN, i.e. piecemeal and fragmented\nThe current system contributes to dysfunctional relationships, i.e. jurisdictional issues (at federal and provincial levels), lack of coordination, working at cross purposes, silo mentality\n[\u2026]\nThe current program focus is on protection (taking children into care) rather than prevention (supporting the family)\n[\u2026]\nEarly intervention\/prevention has become standard practice in the provinces\/territories, numerous U.S. states, and New Zealand\nINAC CFS has been unable to keep up with the provincial changes\nWhere prevention supports are common practice, results have demonstrated that rates of children in care and costs are stabilized and\/or reduced\n(Annex, ex. 35 at pp. 2-3 [Putting Children and Families First in Alberta presentation])\n[271] The Putting Children and Families First in Alberta presentation touts prevention as the ideal option to address these problems at page 4:\nEarly prevention and child-centered outcomes are the missing pieces of the puzzle for FN children and families living on reserve\nEarly prevention supports the agenda for improving quality of life for children and families thereby leading to improved outcomes in the areas of early childhood development, education, and health\n[272] Finally, the Putting Children and Families First in Alberta presentation states at page 5:\nThe facts are clear:\n\u00b7 Wen:De Report - Early intervention\/prevention is KEY\n[\u2026]\n\u00b7 First Nation agencies have been lobbying Canada since 1998 to change the system\n[273] AANDC\u2019s Departmental Audit and Evaluation Branch also performed its own evaluation of the FNCFS Program in 2007 (see Annex, ex. 14 [2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program]). The findings and recommendations of the 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program reflect those of the NPR and Wen:De reports. Of note, at page ii, the 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program makes the following findings:\nAlthough the program has met an increasing demand for services, it is not possible to say that is has achieved its objective of creating a more secure and stable environment for children on reserve, nor has it kept pace with a trend, both nationally and internationally, towards greater emphasis on early intervention and prevention.\nThe program\u2019s funding formula, Directive 20-1, has likely been a factor in increases in the number of children in care and Program expenditures because it has had the effect of steering agencies towards in-care options - foster care, group homes and institutional care because only these agency costs are fully reimbursed.\n[274] In response to these findings, the 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program made six recommendations at page iii, including that AANDC:\n1. clarify the department\u2019s hierarchy of policy objectives for the First Nations Child and Family Services Program, placing the well-being and safety of children at the top;\n2. correct the weakness in the First Nations Child and Family Services Program\u2019s funding formula, which encourages out-of-home placements for children when least disruptive measures (in-home measures) would be more appropriate. Well-being and safety of children must be agencies\u2019 primary considerations in placement decisions;\n[275] The 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program goes on to state that the first step in improving the FNCFS Program is to change Directive 20-1 by providing FNCFS Agencies with a new funding stream that ensures adequate support for prevention work (see at p. 35). In discussing the costs and benefits of increasing the FNCFS Program\u2019s focus on prevention, the cost estimates provided in Wen:De Report Three are outlined, including the $22.9 million for new management information systems, capital costs (buildings, vehicles and office equipment), and insurance premiums; and, the $86.4 million for annual funding needs for such things as an inflation adjustment to restore funding to 1995 levels, adjusting the funding formula for small and remote agencies, and increasing the operations base amount from $143,000 to $308,751 (see 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program at pp. 35-36).\n[276] In a September 11, 2009 response to questions raised by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, Deputy Minister Michael Wernick described the EPFA as an \u201c\u2026approach that will result in better outcomes for First Nation children\u201d (Annex, ex. 36). Mr. Wernick\u2019s response indicates AANDC\u2019s awareness of the impacts that the structure and funding for the FNCFS Program under Directive 20-1 has on the outcomes for First Nations children.\n[277] Similarly, at the hearing, Ms. Murphy described the EPFA as follows:\nMS MacPHEE: Okay. And I think you touched on this earlier, but I wanted to get you to elaborate a little bit more. Could you tell us a little bit how, more specifically maybe, the new Enhanced Prevention Focused Approach was developed? You know, what was the impetus for developing this new approach?\nMS MURPHY: We weren't getting good outcomes. MS MURPHY: We were having challenges with First Nations, we were having challenges with the number of children in care, and we wanted to reduce that number and we wanted to have kids be safe and we wanted to avoid having kids having to come into care. I mean, the challenge for first Nations communities -- and I'm sure this has already been outlined here by others, is that, especially for small, remote communities, when child needs to be taken into care, sometimes there's not community-based options, so the child may not stay in that community. And taking a child away from their family and from their community has impacts for sure. So we wanted to find community-based solutions so kids could stay in their communities, be close to \u2013 and hopefully have the families be able to be reunited. So we wanted to do that early intervention work which would actually avoid having to have the children actually being removed from their parental home and perhaps being located outside at a distance from their community.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at pp.49-50)\n[278] However, as the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada, and the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts pointed out, while the EPFA is an improvement on Directive 20-1, it still relies on the problematic assumptions regarding children in care, families in need, and population levels to determine funding. Furthermore, many provinces and the Yukon remain under Directive 20-1 despite AANDC\u2019s commitment to transition those jurisdictions to the EPFA.\n[279] AANDC argues the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, and the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada, should also be given minimal weight since the authors of the reports were not called to substantiate the documents or provide the context of statements or opinions contained therein. Additionally, AANDC argues these reports are not probative of the facts in issue.\n[280] The Panel rejects AANDC\u2019s arguments concerning the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada. The Auditor General of Canada did not testify before the Tribunal as she or he is not a compellable witness (see section 18.1 of the Auditor General Act). Nevertheless, the Panel is satisfied the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada are highly reliable, relevant, and clear. They are written to report findings in a comprehensive manner so as to allow Parliament and all Canadians to understand its recommendations. As stated at section 7(2) of the Auditor General Act, reports of the Auditor General of Canada are filed annually with the House of Commons in order to \u201c\u2026call attention to anything that he considers to be of significance and of a nature that should be brought to the attention of the House of Commons\u2026\u201d.\n[281] Given that the Auditor General is an independent public office in Canada, serving the interests of all Canadians, it would be unreasonable to expect the Panel give little or no weight to the report and findings in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada, especially given the fact that many findings in the reports are specific to the FNCFS Program. In addition, as was outlined above, AANDC publicly accepted the recommendations emanating from the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada, reinforcing the reports\u2019 relevance and reliability in this matter. The Panel accepts the findings of the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada.\n[282] Similarly, the Panel finds the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to be highly relevant and reliable in this case. In addition to the fact that the reports relate directly of the FNCFS Program, they are also authored by elected officials performing public duties for the benefit of all Canadians. High ranking officials from AANDC were able to testify before the Committee and, in doing so, acknowledged the findings in those reports. Again, the Panel accepts the findings of the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.\n[283] The statements of the Deputy Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts also indicate that they viewed the EPFA as the solution to address the flaws in Directive 20-1. Again, internal AANDC documents support the findings in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada and the 2012 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, regarding the need to transition those jurisdictions still under Directive 20-1 to the EPFA, while also acknowledging the need to improve the EPFA.\n[284] In 2010, AANDC\u2019s Evaluation, Performance Measurement and Review Branch did its own evaluation of the implementation of the EPFA in Alberta (see Annex, ex. 37 [AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta]). The evaluation found that the design of the EPFA was a move in the right direction with potential for positive outcomes. However, it identified some challenges with the EPFA model, including: timing, provincial requirements, human resources shortages, salaries, support from government\/agency management, community linkages, training and geographical isolation. All these were considered by FNFCS Agencies to be essential to the successful implementation of the approach. An additional challenge identified is ensuring that reliable data is collected to allow for accurate performance measurement and some comparability of prevention services (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta at pp. vi, 11,16-17, 21-24).\n[285] Moreover, the evaluation noted that, as the EPFA is based on an annual allocation for most aspects and some pieces being determined by a formula, \u201cthere is not the flexibility to respond quickly to changes in provincial policy or other external drivers\u2026\u201d (AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta at p. 27). According to the evaluation, this lack of flexibility \u201c\u2026is common to INAC programs that adhere to provincial legislation and [\u2026] [is] an in-built risk to the program\u201d (AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta at p. 27).\n[286] Furthermore, several jurisdictional issues were identified as challenging the effectiveness of service delivery, notably the availability and access to supportive services for prevention. In this regard, the evaluation noted that a common implementation challenge for FNCFS Agencies was the need for specialized services at the community level (for example, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder assessments, therapy, counselling and addictions support). Moreover, the evaluation found of key importance the availability and access to supportive services for prevention. According to the evaluation, these services are not available through AANDC funding, though they are provided by other government departments and programs either on reserve or off reserve (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta at pp. 16-18, 21-24).\n[287] The evaluation recommended revisiting the EPFA funding model within the next year to learn from the past two years of implementation and to incorporate additional resources to address some of the issues faced by rural and remote communities. As part of this review, it recommended AANDC also determine if the calculations that are based on assumed population of children in care are relevant in achieving desired outcomes (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta at p.i).\n[288] In 2012, the Evaluation, Performance Measurement and Review Branch of AANDC also did its own evaluation of the implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia (see Annex, ex. 38 [AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia]; see also, Annex, ex. 39). Again, the findings are in line with those of the other reports on the FNCFS Program.\n[289] The 2012 evaluation found it was unclear whether the EPFA is flexible enough to accommodate provincial funding changes (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia at p. 51). It noted both the Saskatchewan and Atlantic regional offices struggle to effectively perform their work given staffing limitations, including staffing shortages, caseload ratios that exceed the provincial standard, and difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified staff, particularly First Nation staff (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia at p. 51). Capital expenditures on new buildings, new vehicles and computer hardware were identified as being necessary to achieve compliance with provincial standards, but also as making FNCFS Agencies a more desirable place to work. However, these expenditures were not anticipated when implementing the EPFA and were identified as often being funded through prevention dollars (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia at p. 49).\n[290] One of the main challenges identified in the implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia was unrealistic expectations, largely by community leadership, of what agencies are able to achieve with the funding they receive. According to the evaluation, community leadership occasionally expect agencies to cover costs that are social in nature but that do not fall under the agency\u2019s eligible expenditures. That is, the conditions which contribute most to a child\u2019s risk are conditions that the child welfare system itself does not have the mandate or capacity to directly address, including economic development, health programing, education and cultural integrity (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia at pp. 35, 49, 51). The AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia states, at page 49: \u201cAANDC could improve its efficiency by having a better understanding of other AANDC or federal programming that affect children and parents requiring child and family services and facilitating the coordination of these programs\u201d.\n[291] Difficulties based on remoteness were also identified as a main challenge in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. One third of agencies reported high cost and time commitments required to travel to different reserves, along with the related risks associated with not reaching high-risk cases in a timely manner. In Nova Scotia, where there is only one FNCFS Agency with two offices throughout the province, the evaluation noted it can take two to three hours to reach a child in the southwestern part of the province. On the other hand, the provincial model is structured so that its agencies are no more than a half-hour away from a child in urgent need. In extreme cases, the Nova Scotia FNCFS Agency has had to rely on the provincial agencies for assistance. According to the evaluation, because of these issues the province of Nova Scotia has recommended that AANDC provide funding to support a third office in the southwestern part of the province (see AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia at pp. 35-36).\n[292] In an August 2012 presentation, entitled \u201cFirst Nations Child and Family Services Program (FNCFS) The Way Forward\u201d, Ms. Odette Johnson, Director of the Children and Family Services Directorate of AANDC outlined to Fran\u00e7oise Ducros, Assistant Deputy Minister, ESDPPS, the need to reassess the EPFA (see Annex, ex. 40 [the Way Forward presentation]). The purpose of the presentation was \u201c[t]o provide options and seek approval for next steps in the reform of the FNCFS Program\u201d (Way Forward presentation at p. 2). It identifies the drivers behind this reform as: the provincial\/territorial shift to prevention, the high numbers\/costs of First Nation children in care, AANDC internal audits and evaluations of the FNCFS (along with those of the Auditor General), the reports of Parliamentary Committees, the human rights complaint, and child advocate reports and other research (see the Way Forward presentation at p. 5).\n[293] According to the Way Forward presentation, \u201c[a]udits and evaluations of between 2008 and 2012 demonstrate a need for the EPFA, but also a need to annually review the EPFA formula as constant provincial changes make it difficult to stay current and enable Agencies to provide a full range of child welfare services\u201d (at p. 9). Furthermore, \u201c[p]rovinces have been shifting their caseloads towards greater emphasis on intake and investigation which may not have been part of original EPFA discussions and are now creating pressures on Agencies\u201d (see the Way Forward presentation at p. 9).\n[294] At page 13, the Way Forward presentation provides a comparative table of \u201cwhere we are\u201d and \u201cwhere we need to go\u201d:\nWhere we are\nWhere we need to go\nTaking children into care and some work with families in the home\n\u2192\nTaking children in care for critical cases but more with the families in the home.\nFund agencies and provinces for basic protection services and some prevention with families in the home.\n\u2192\nEither fund full range of services provided by provinces (differs among jurisdictions) OR transfer child welfare on reserve to the Provincial\/Territorial governments.\nInitial investments in EPFA in 6 jurisdictions but not necessarily addressing all aspects of child welfare.\n\u2192\nEPFA in all jurisdictions fully costed at $108.13M, supporting all aspects of child welfare including intake, early intervention and allowing for developmental phase.\nDeveloping some capacity for prevention in communities.\n\u2192\nAll communities have capacity in prevention.\n[295] The presentation proposes three options to address these issues: (1) implement EPFA in the remaining jurisdictions; (2) expand the EPFA with increased investments to address cost drivers, including implementing the model in the remaining jurisdiction; and, (3) transfer the program to the provinces\/territories.\n[296] Under option 1, the costs of transferring the remaining jurisdictions to EPFA are estimated at: $21 million for British Columbia; $2 million for the Yukon; $5 million for Ontario; $2 million for New Brunswick; and, $2 million for Newfoundland and Labrador. (see Way Forward presentation at p. 15). There is also an additional $4 million listed for \u201cMaintenance\u201d which Ms. Murphy explained as an infusion of additional funds to avoid having to re-allocate money from elsewhere in AANDC to cover additional costs that go beyond the standard funding formula (see Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 167-168). Furthermore, an additional $2 million is estimated for \u201cStrength and Accountability\u201d to allow AANDC to better administer the FNCFS Program internally (see testimony of S. Murphy, Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 168).\n[297] The presentation lists as a \u201cPRO\u201d for this option the recognition that the FNCFS Program cannot address all root causes of the over-representation of children in care. Under \u201cCONS\u201d it states the \u201c5-year EPFA funding envelope may not be addressing provincial cost drivers or funding pressures related to the operational efficiencies of Agencies\u201d (Way Forward presentation at p. 15). According to Ms. Murphy, who stated she had signed off on the presentation, the major cost drivers are increases in the rates for maintaining children in care, growth in the number of children that come into care and salary increases (see Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 158-159, 179 and 181). She elaborated on the \u201cCON\u201d for option 1 as follows:\nSo with this option we were talking about maintenance, but we weren't necessarily dealing with all of the cost drivers that we were observing.\nSo, as an example, we know that the cost of foster care is going up and so, Agencies are trying to pay those bills and we hadn't properly calculated that in our model.\nThis option wasn't trying to re-stabilize the existing EPFA jurisdictions for the cost changes that had happened since we introduced the funding models, it was really about the five. So it was sort of the minimum option at the time.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at p. 169)\n[298] For option 2, the implementation of the expanded EPFA in the remaining jurisdictions is estimated at $65.03 million, while topping-up the existing EPFA jurisdictions is estimated at $43.10 million, for a total of $108.13 million. In addition to these amounts, the presentation indicates that a 3% escalator will be required every year. The \u201cPROS\u201d of this option are that it ensures agencies are able to meet changing provincial standards and salary rates while maintaining a high level of prevention programming; and, that funding remains reasonably comparable with provinces and territories. Under \u201cCONS\u201d, the presentation states: \u201cOption 2 is more costly than Status Quo EPFA implementation\u201d (Way Forward presentation at p. 16). During testimony, Ms. Murphy was asked whether the \u201cPROS\u201d of this option suggest that AANDC is not able to provide a reasonably comparable level of services under the FNCFS Program. Ms. Murphy responded:\nIt has always been our intention to provide reasonably comparable services.\nWe were noticing trends in increasing kids in care and we were having stresses in our budget to be able to maintain those levels and, of course, the Department's doing re-allocations, but we weren't \u2013 we noticed changes for sure and we needed to keep up with those changes and we weren't necessarily being successful in all cases of being able to do that.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 163-164)\n[299] Finally, the third option of transferring child welfare on reserve to the provinces\/territory does not have an estimated cost, but the presentation indicates there is \u201c[p]otential for dramatic increases in costs\u201d (Way Forward presentation at p. 17). As Ms. Murphy put it:\nit\u2019s certainly expected that if you were to ask someone else to start to take on the delivery of a program, they\u2019re going to have their administrative cost structure, they\u2019re going to potentially look for funds to offset the cost of them assuming that role.\n[\u2026]\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that it would. We didn't -- necessarily hadn't costed any of that, but we wanted to at least highlight that there might be a potential for an increase in costs because we might have to absorb, for instance, increased administrative costs that weren't necessarily there right now in the way that we're funding individual Agencies.\nAnd other costs, we don't know. They may want to negotiate other things as part and parcel of taking on that responsibility and we wouldn't wait until you got to negotiation to find out what that was.\n(Transcript Vol. 54 at pp. 166-167).\n[300] The \u201cPROS\u201d of option 3 include: comparability issue would be resolved and better oversight\/compliance of child and family services on reserve. Along with the potential for a dramatic increase in costs, the presentation also includes as \u201cCONS\u201d for this option that support for all First Nations is uncertain, and that it involves complimentary programs, therefore, it is a big task to implement and involves cost implications beyond AANDC (Way Forward presentation at p. 17).\n[301] Following on the Way Forward presentation, in two similar presentations in October and November 2012, Ms. Murphy expanded on the options for reforming the FNCFS Program (see testimony of S. Murphy, Transcript Vol. 55 at p. 199). In these presentations Ms. Murphy proposed that AANDC complete the reform of the FNCFS Program to EPFA in the remaining jurisdictions (estimated at $139.7 million over 5 years and $36.6 million ongoing); stabilize pressures in existing EPFA jurisdictions (estimated at 164.1 million over 5 years); add a 3% escalator per year for all jurisdictions to ensure provincial\/territorial comparability (estimated at $105.5 million over 5 years and $23.9 million ongoing); and seek additional resources for increased program management and strengthened accountability (estimated at $11.2 million over 5 years and $2.3 million ongoing) (see Annex, ex. 41 at p. 2 [the Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (October 31, 2012) presentation]; and, Annex, ex. 42 at pp. 2, 5 [the Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (November 2, 2012) presentation]).\n[302] The need for this increased funding is explained as:\nMaintenance rate increases for children in care have far exceeded the two percent AANDC receives annually. As a result, the Department must reallocate funds from other program areas to cover the deficit.\nAANDC must pay the costs to support children in care and these costs are still rising dramatically. As maintenance rates are essentially dictated by provinces, AANDC has no choice but to support the costs of children in care based on these rates.\nIn addition, no program escalator was approved for any funding model used by the FNCFS Program to help address increased costs over time and to ensure that prevention-based investments more closely match the full continuum of child welfare services provided off reserve.\n[\u2026]\nCurrently, AANDC has very limited human resources dedicated to the FNCFS Program.\nNo funding for strengthened accountability for results was provided when EPFA was approved in 2007.\nAANDC\u2019s activities have increased dramatically with the implementation of EPFA in the 6 jurisdictions.\nAANDC is currently limited in how effectively it can manage and monitor the program while developing tripartite partnerships to fully implement EPFA.\n(Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (October 31, 2012) presentation at pp. 5-6)\n[303] In Ms. Murphy\u2019s view, while positive outcomes from the EPFA have been identified, \u201cthe program is losing ground due to increasing provincial costs\u201d (Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (November 2, 2012) presentation at p. 3). Furthermore, she views her proposal as addressing \u201c\u2026rising maintenance costs in all jurisdictions\u201d, it \u201callows the program to accommodate provincial rate changes thereby maintaining comparability\u201d, and \u201cwill allow agencies to devote appropriate resources to prevention, which will lead to a decrease in long term care placements in the medium to longer term\u201d (Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (November 2, 2012) presentation at p. 6). The impacts of no new investments in the FNCFS Program would, according to Ms. Murphy, \u201c\u2026not advance improved outcomes for First Nations children and their families\u201d and \u201c[t]he Government of Canada will not be able to sustain reasonable provincial comparability for child welfare support\u201d (Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (November 2, 2012) presentation at p. 8). At the hearing, Ms. Murphy was asked to expand on this last point:\nMEMBER BELANGER: \"The Government of Canada will not be able to sustain reasonable provincial comparability for child welfare support.\" What are we comparing here?\nMS MURPHY: I think what we were saying there was that we were starting to have issues in terms of being able to match salaries and the costs of keeping children in care, those other elements that I have laid out, and that so we may have trouble paying those bills.\nWe are paying those bills now, but if you keep going, at some point you hit the wall and you don't have the ability to continue to reallocate, you put at risk that policy concept of comparability.\n(Transcript Vol. 55 at p. 216)\n[304] For reasons that were not elaborated upon at the hearing, the above options and recommendations were not implemented in AANDC\u2019s 2013 or 2014 budgets (see Transcript Vol. 55 at pp. 206-208, 221; see also Transcript Vol. 61 at pp. 159-162).\n[305] Overall, on the issue of the relevance and reliability of the reports on the FNCFS Program, the Panel finds that from the years 2000 to 2012 many reliable sources have identified the adverse effects of the funding formulas and structure of the FNCFS Program. AANDC was involved in the NPR and Wen:De reports, and acknowledged and accepted the findings and recommendations in the Auditor General and Standing Committee on Public Account\u2019s reports, including developing an action plan to address those recommendations. As the internal evaluations and other relevant and reliable AANDC documents demonstrate, those studies and reports became the basis for reforming Directive 20-1 into the EPFA and, subsequently, recommendations to reform the EPFA. It is only now, in the context of this Complaint, that AANDC raises concerns about the reliability and weight of the various reports on the FNCFS Program outlined above. Moreover, the internal documents discussed above support those reports and are AANDC\u2019s own evaluations, recommendations and presentations prepared by its high ranking employees. For these reasons, the Panel does not accept AANDC\u2019s argument that the reports on the FNCFS Program have little or no weight and accepts the findings in those reports, along with the corroborating information in documents relied on above.\nb. The choices of FNCFS Agencies and additional funding provided\n[306] AANDC argues the difference between the level of services and programs offered on and off reserve may have little to do with funding and more to do with the choices made by FNCFS Agencies about the type of services and programs they want to provide and other administrative issues affecting the overall budget. For example, some agencies decide to allocate funds to the salaries of their board members when the budget should be spent on front line services. Also, AANDC points out that some agencies are successful with their budget, including some agencies who have posted surpluses. AANDC submits it also provides additional funding or reallocates funds where FNCFS Agencies require further funding. Therefore, if there are gaps in funding, AANDC contends it has bridged those gaps through additional funds.\n[307] As outlined above, Directive 20-1 and the EPFA have certain assumptions built into their funding formulas. In general, that the child population they serve is 1000 children aged 0-18, that 6% of the total on reserve child population is in care, and that 20% of families are in need of services. Ms. D\u2019Amico explained the use of assumptions as providing stability for FNCFS Agencies. That is, even if less than 6% of its children are in care and 20% of its families are in need of services, it would not reduce the agency\u2019s budget. That may indeed be a beneficial situation for agencies where these assumptions accurately reflect their clientele and may even result in the agency receiving a surplus of funding. However, on this last point, the Panel notes Wen:De Report Two stated: \u201cNot surprisingly, it was only BC agencies that advised that they had surpluses and, in almost all cases, the surplus came from the maintenance per diem arrangement\u201d (at p. 213). More fundamentally though, where the assumptions do not accurately reflect the clientele of an FNCFS Agency - where the percentage of children in care and families in need of services is higher than 6% and 20% respectively - the funding formula is bound to provide inadequate funding.\n[308] In 2006, 18 FNCFS Agencies had over 10% of their children in care out of the parental home (see Social Programs presentation at p. 13). In the same year, there were 257 First Nations communities on reserves with no access to child care and many more communities did not have enough resources to support 20% of children from birth to six years of age (see Social Programs presentation at p. 14).\n[309] For Alberta, Ms. Schimanke indicated that most FNCFS Agencies have around 6% of children in care, but there are some that have anywhere from 11 to 14% (see Transcript Vol. 61 at pp. 113-115). Also, as stated above in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, in the five provinces covered by the report, the percentage of children in care ranged from 0 to 28%.\n[310] In Manitoba, Ms. Elsie Flette, Chief Executive Office of the First Nations of Southern Manitoba Child and Family Services Authority (since retired), described the effects of the assumptions on FNCFS Agencies:\nIf you're an Agency that has, you know, five percent of its child population in care, you benefit from that assumption, you're being paid by AANDC as if seven percent of your kids were in care. So, you're getting more money and you don't have the cases, you don't have the children in care that you have to spend that money on and, so, you have some flexibility for how else to use that money.\nBut if you're an Agency that has more than seven percent of its children in care, you have a problem. And we have in the Southern Authority I believe right now four Agencies that exceed those assumptions. And one of them in particular, they have -- 14 percent of their child population is in care, so, they have exactly half of the kids in care for which they receive no money.\nWhen we look at the families and prevention services, I believe there's about five Agencies that exceed that 20 percent. The same Agency that has the 14 percent children has a 40 percent families, so, 40 percent of their families on- Reserve are getting service.\nThey're funded for 20 percent. So, half their workload both for families and for kids is completely unfunded, they get no money. So, anything they might have for prevention they can't do because all their money has to go \u2013 they have these kids, they need workers, they have to service that pop -- that workload and there's no way -- under the funding model itself, there's no way to adjust for that.\n[\u2026]\nSo, it's not an accurate -- it is an accurate average percent, but for individual Agencies it's often inaccurate, you can have lower numbers or, in particular, if you have higher than seven percent you have unfunded workload.\n(Transcript Vol. 20 at pp. 104-105, 118)\n[311] While additional funds have been provided or reallocated to cover maintenance expenditures and\/or some ad hoc exceptional circumstances, FNCFS Agencies are expected to cover their operations and prevention costs within their fixed budgets, including using those funds to cover any deficits in maintenance expenditures. Those budgets are based on the formulas that, again, do not account for the actual needs of the FNCFS Agencies. They are also static formulas. That is, as the years go by, the formulas become more and more disconnected from the actual needs of FNCFS Agencies and the children and families they serve. Specifically, the formulas do not apply an escalator for regular increases in costs, including for salaries, where the bulk of funding is spent. While Directive 20-1 calls for a cost of living increase of 2% every year, that increase has not been applied since 1995-1996. Similarly, once EPFA is implemented in a jurisdiction, aside from adjustments for population size, yearly increases in costs are not accounted for in the funding formula. In Alberta for example, as indicated above, funding under EPFA is provided based on provincial rates from 2006. According to an AANDC official, it is up to FNCFS Agencies to work with the budgets they have:\nMR. POULIN: So for an Agency that is over 6 percent, where you need more protection workers, that component, all that component will be eaten up, that operations budget will be eaten up with what is essential to meet your immediate needs, and so that leaves very little for anything like brief services.\nMS SCHIMANKE: It could be. It depends how they set their budget and how they set their salary grids. Like, again, that is the Agencies that decide that, right, and how they manage that.\nMR. POULIN: That means paying -- you know, that means in effect paying your workers less than what the province does.\nMS SCHIMANKE: It could be, yes. That could be one example of things, yes.\nMR. POULIN: It could be having less workers and therefore having a higher case ratio than your workers -- than the province does.\nMS SCHIMANKE: It could be, yes.\nI do have to show, though, that there are Agencies who are above the 6 percent who still show surpluses, so I don't know what they are doing differently. It could be their salaries have been adjusted very low; we don't know what they are doing to make that happen. It may be they're short-staffed and they are just not -- and the staff are carrying higher caseloads, yeah. So there are various examples of what different Agencies are doing, yes.\n(Transcript Vol. 62 at pp. 51-52)\n[312] These last statements highlight the dichotomy between the objective of the FNCFS Program and its actual implementation through Directive 20-1 and the EPFA. While the program is premised upon provincial comparability, the funding mechanisms do not allow many FNCFS Agencies, particularly those agencies that do not match AANDC\u2019s assumptions about children in care and families in need, to keep up with provincial standards and changes thereto.\n[313] As noted by the reports on the FNCFS Program, given that funding under Directive 20-1 and the EPFA is largely based on population levels, small and remote agencies are also disproportionately affected by AANDC\u2019s funding formulas. In British Columbia for example, small agencies are the norm, not the exception, including many that serve rural and isolated communities. Their challenges include added costs for travel, accessing the communities they serve and getting and retaining staff (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at p. 87).\n[314] Given these agencies are funded pursuant to Directive 20-1, most do not have the flexibility or resources necessary to provide prevention services, even with additional funds. In these rural and isolated communities, it is also difficult for First Nations people to access services which are available off reserve, including: mental health services; services to strengthen families; and services for family preservation and reunification (see Annex, ex. 43; see also testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at p. 87 and Vol. 64 at pp. 6, 167). Despite moving FNCFS Agencies in British Columbia to funding based on actuals in 2011, with the intent to transition them to the EPFA shortly thereafter to address some of these concerns; and, despite the repeated requests of FNFCS Agencies and the province of British Columbia, that transition had yet to occur at the time of the hearing and no announcement was made for EPFA in the 2013-2014 budgets (see testimony of W. McArthur, Transcript Vol. 63 at pp. 96-97, 156, 172-173).\n[315] The effects of the population thresholds in Directive 20-1, along with the other assumptions built into Directive 20-1 and the EPFA, indicate that a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d approach does not work for child and family services on reserve. The overwhelming evidence in this case suggests that because AANDC does not fund FNCFS Agencies based on need but, rather, based on assumptions of need and population levels, that funding is inadequate to provide essential child and family services to many First Nations. Moreover, the internal AANDC documents outlined above, namely the Way Forward presentation and the Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program presentation, indicate that, despite any additional funds provided or reallocated to FNCFS Agencies, there is still quite a significant difference in funding levels to bring the FNCFS Program into comparability with the provinces. This point is addressed in more detail in the following section.\nc. Comparator evidence\n[316] AANDC contends that comparison is an essential part of the analysis under human rights legislation. It submits that no evidence was advanced by the Complainants regarding how the provincial or territorial funding models work or what their respective child welfare budgets are as compared to the federal government. In this regard, AANDC argues that the Tribunal should draw a negative inference from the fact that the Complainants did not call provincial and territorial witnesses to testify.\n[317] According to AANDC, the Complainants\u2019 case lacks substantive evidence about the level of provincial funding compared to federal funding, including addressing the nature and extent of any research thereon. Moreover, no provincial or territorial witnesses were called to support the allegation that there is a difference in child welfare funding or service levels on or off reserve. Given that comparison between federal and provincial funding was at the heart of their case, AANDC submits the Complainants had to demonstrate how much funding is provided by the federal government and each provincial\/territorial government for child welfare services. Only if the amount of funding for both was reliably established, could the Tribunal determine if there is a difference and whether that difference amounts to adverse differentiation or a denial of services. According to AANDC, perceived differences in services on and off reserve are not sufficient to substantiate the Complainants\u2019 claims.\n[318] In any event, AANDC argues that comparing the federal and provincial\/territorial funding systems is not a valid comparison under the CHRA.\n[319] AANDC\u2019s argument regarding the need for comparative evidence, and that comparing the federal and provincial\/territorial funding systems is not valid under the CHRA, has already been rejected by the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal and this Tribunal. In setting aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision on AANDC\u2019s jurisdictional motion (2011 CHRT 4), which advanced this same argument, the Federal Court in Caring Society FC found at paragraph 251:\nthe Tribunal erred in concluding that the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cdifferentiate adversely\u201d in subsection 5(b) requires a comparator group in every case in order to establish discrimination in the provision of services. This conclusion is unreasonable as it flies in the face of the scheme and purpose of the Act, and leads to patently absurd results that could not have been intended by Parliament.\n[320] The Federal Court explained some of the patently absurd results of requiring a comparator group in every case:\n[256] On the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, the employer who consciously decides to pay his or her only employee less because she is a woman, or black, or Muslim, would not have committed a discriminatory practice within the meaning of subsection 7(b) of the Act because there is no other employee to whom the disadvantaged employee could be compared.\n[257] Similarly, the shopkeeper who forces his or her employee to work in the back of the shop after discovering that the employee is gay would not have committed a discriminatory practice if no one else was employed in the store.\n[\u2026]\n[259] In the examples cited above, individuals are clearly being treated in an adverse differential manner in their employment because of their membership in a protected group. However, according to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation, no recourse would be available to these individuals under the Act. Such an interpretation does not accord with the purpose of the legislation and is unreasonable.\n(Caring Society FC at paras. 256-257, 259)\n[321] After examining the role of comparator groups in a discrimination analysis and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Withler v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12 (Withler), the Federal Court made the following statements with regard to the use of comparator groups in analyzing alleged discrimination against Aboriginal peoples:\n[332] Aboriginal people occupy a unique position within Canada\u2019s constitutional and legal structure.\n[\u2026]\n[337] By interpreting subsection 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act so as to require a mirror comparator group in every case in order to establish adverse differential treatment in the provision of services, the Tribunal\u2019s decision means that, unlike other Canadians, First Nations people will be limited in their ability to seek the protection of the Act if they believe that they have been discriminated against in the provision of a government service on the basis of their race or national or ethnic origin. This is not a reasonable outcome.\n[\u2026]\n[340] I also agree with the applicants that an interpretation of subsection 5(b) that accepts the sui generis status of First Nations, and recognizes that different approaches to assessing claims of discrimination may be necessary depending on the social context of the claim, is one that is consistent with and promotes Charter values.\n(Caring Society FC at paras. 332, 337, 340)\n[322] On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal accepted the Federal Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the use of comparator groups in a discrimination analysis. In fact, it noted that cases postdating the Federal Court\u2019s decision confirmed the reduced role of comparator groups in the analysis:\nIn Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, the Supreme Court reiterated that the existence of a comparator group does not determine or define the presence of discrimination, but rather, at best, is just useful evidence. It added that insistence on a mirror comparator group would return us to formalism, rather than substantive equality, and \u201crisks perpetuating the very disadvantage and exclusion from mainstream society the [Human Rights] Code is intended to remedy\u201d (at paragraphs 30-31). The focus of the inquiry is not on comparator groups but \u201cwhether there is discrimination, period\u201d (at paragraph 60).\nIn Quebec (Attorney General) v. A., 2013 SCC 5 at paragraph 346 (per Abella J. for the majority), the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that \u201ca mirror comparator group analysis may fail to capture substantive equality, may become a search for sameness, may shortcut the second stage of the substantive equality analysis, and may be difficult to apply\u201d: Withler, supra at paragraph 60. The Supreme Court went so far as to cast doubt on the authority of Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh, 2002 SCC 83, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 325, an earlier case in which an unduly influential or determinative role was given to the existence of a comparator group \u2013 similar to what the Tribunal did here.\n(Caring Society FCA at para. 18)\n[323] The Panel agrees with the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning on the role of comparator groups in a discrimination analysis. AANDC\u2019s argument regarding the need for comparative evidence in this case is inconsistent with the Caring Society FC and Caring Society FCA decisions. Furthermore, there is no authority for its proposition that interjurisdictional comparisons are not valid under the CHRA.\n[324] While the Supreme Court has previously stated that equality is a comparative concept, it has also recognized that \u201c\u2026every difference in treatment between individuals under the law will not necessarily result in inequality and, as well, that identical treatment may frequently produce serious inequality\u201d (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 SCR 143 at p. 164 [Andrews]). With regard to this last statement, the Supreme Court in Withler, at paragraph 2, stated that equality is about substance, not formalism:\nIn our view, the central issue in this and others. 15(1) cases is whether the impugned law violates the animating norm of s. 15(1), substantive equality: Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143. To determine whether the law violates this norm, the matter must be considered in the full context of the case, including the law\u2019s real impact on the claimants and members of the group to which they belong. The central s. 15(1) concern is substantive, not formal, equality. A formal equality analysis based on mirror comparator groups can be detrimental to the analysis. Care must be taken to avoid converting the inquiry into substantive equality into a formalistic and arbitrary search for the \u201cproper\u201d comparator group. At the end of the day there is only one question: Does the challenged law violate the norm of substantive equality in s. 15(1) of the Charter?\n[325] As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in Caring Society FCA, the decisions in Moore and Quebec (Attorney General) v. A., 2013 SCC 5 (A), echo the approach to comparator groups enunciated in Withler. That is, while the use of comparative evidence may be useful in analyzing a claim of discrimination, it is not determinative of the issue. In fact, as the Supreme Court noted in Withler, at paragraph 59: \u201cfinding a mirror group may be impossible, as the essence of an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s equality claim may be that, in light of their distinct needs and circumstances, no one is like them for the purposes of comparison\u201d.\n[326] Rather, the full context of the case and all relevant evidence, including any comparative evidence, must be considered (see Withler at para. 2). As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 at paragraph 27 (Morris), the legal definition of a prima facie case does not require a complainant to adduce any particular type of evidence to prove the existence of a discriminatory practice under the CHRA. It is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced in any given case is sufficient to prove a discriminatory practice. The Federal Court of Appeal in Morris, at paragraph 28, concluded that:\nA flexible legal test of a prima facie case is better able than more precise tests to advance the broad purpose underlying the Canadian Human Rights Act, namely, the elimination in the federal legislative sphere of discrimination from employment, and from the provision of goods, services, facilities, and accommodation. Discrimination takes new and subtle forms.\n[327] In this vein, the Panel notes the present Complaint was brought under both subsections 5(a) and (b) of the CHRA. The interpretation of the wording of subsection 5(b), \u201cto differentiate adversely\u201d, has largely been the basis for arguing the need for comparative evidence. That is, \u201cto differentiate\u201d is to treat someone differently in comparison to others. Aside from the French version of subsection 5(b) not having the same comparative connotation, as it simply uses the term \u201cd\u00e9favoriser\u201d, subsection 5(a) also does not use wording implying a comparison. It speaks only of being denied a good or a service. As the Federal Court noted in Caring Society FC, requiring comparator evidence under 5(b), but not under 5(a), would create an internal incoherence between the subsections by establishing different legal and evidentiary requirements in order to establish discrimination under each provision (see Caring Society FC at paras. 276-279).\n[328] Similarly, AANDC\u2019s argument that there can be no cross-jurisdictional comparisons or comparisons between different service providers is not supported by anything found in the CHRA or in the jurisprudence regarding comparator evidence outlined in the preceding paragraphs. In fact, section 50(3)(c) of the CHRA allows the Panel to receive and accept any evidence and information that is sees fit, as long as it is not privileged information [s. 50(4)] or the testimony of a conciliator appointed to settle the complaint [s. 50(5)]. Furthermore, reasonable comparability with provincial\/territorial standards is part of AANDC\u2019s own objective in implementing the FNCFS Program and negotiating the other provincial\/territorial agreements. While AANDC argues \u201creasonable comparability\u201d is an administrative term and not a legal term requiring mirror services are provided on and off reserve, that argument has no bearing on the Complainants\u2019 ability to bring evidence related thereto. AANDC undertook to ensure First Nations on reserve receive reasonably comparable child and family services to those provided off reserve in similar circumstances. It is unreasonable and unfounded to argue the Complainants should not be able to bring evidence related thereto.\n[329] While there is no obligation to bring forward comparative evidence to substantiate a discrimination complaint, there was some comparative evidence brought forward in this case demonstrating a difference between child and family services funding and service levels provided on and off reserve. First, the FNCFS Agencies still under Directive 20-1 receive less funding than those who have transitioned to the EPFA. As indicated in the 2011 Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada, funding for operations and prevention services increased between 50 and 100% in each of the provinces that transitioned to EPFA (see at p. 25, s. 4.54). Furthermore, as indicated above, AANDC has estimated the difference in annual funding to transfer the remaining jurisdictions to the EPFA as $21 million for British Columbia; $2 million for the Yukon; $5 million for Ontario; $2 million for New Brunswick; and, $2 million for Newfoundland and Labrador (see Way Forward presentation at p. 15). As Ms. D\u2019Amico stated at the hearing:\nMEMBER LUSTIG: Okay. So is it fair to say then that while your best efforts are underway and you are attempting to address on various front [the shortcomings in the funding formulas], there isn\u2018t comparability yet; this is something you are trying to attain?\nMS. D\u2018AMICO: In six jurisdictions, I can tell you that there is comparability. In the other jurisdictions, because we haven't moved to EPFA, the amounts that they are receiving are more than 20-1, but I could not tell you definitively that it is comparable with the province in terms of the funding ratios because 20-1, even with the added dollars, we have run most of the formulas with the remaining jurisdictions and they would receive more under EPFA based on all of those ratios.\n(Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 179-180)\n[330] Second, AANDC has identified that increases in funding are even necessary in EPFA jurisdictions to ensure reasonable comparability with the provinces. Again, in the Way Forward presentation, it states the \u201cEPFA funding envelope may not be addressing provincial cost drivers or funding pressures related to the operational efficiencies of Agencies\u201d (at p. 15). To address this, the presentation presents the option of adjusting the EPFA costing model with increased investments to address cost drivers: \u201cEPFA Plus\u201d. To implement this increased investment in the jurisdictions that do not function under the EPFA, the Way Forward presentation estimates the cost to be $65.03 million. To top-up the existing EPFA jurisdictions, EPFA Plus is estimated to cost $43.10 million. According to the Way Forward presentation, EPFA Plus \u201c[e]nsures funding remains reasonably comparable with provinces and territories\u2026\u201d (at p. 16). While AANDC witnesses testified that the amounts in the Way Forward presentation are rough estimates that err on the size of magnitude, the Panel still finds they are indicative of the type of investments required to provide more meaningful services to First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon.\n[331] Moreover, these amounts are similar to those recommended in Wen:De Report Three (see at p. 33). Wen:De Report Three also cautioned against implementing its recommendations in a piece meal fashion as doing so would undermine the overall efficacy of its proposed changes (see at p. 15). However, by not addressing all the shortcomings of Directive 20-1 in implementing the EPFA, the overall efficacy of the EPFA model is now undermined as indicated in the Way Forward presentation.\n[332] A third comparison also arises from the Way Forward presentation. To resolve comparability, the presentation recommends AANDC transfer child welfare services on reserve to the provinces\/territory. It recognizes that the provinces and territories have expertise in child welfare and that there would be better oversight and compliance of child and family services on reserve if they are given the full range of responsibilities, including the responsibility for funding. However, the presentation notes that this option has the \u201c[p]otential for dramatic increases in costs\u201d for AANDC (Way Forward presentation at p. 17).\n[333] In this same vein, another useful comparison in this case is the difference between the delivery of child and family services through the FNCFS Program against the delivery of those services through the Alberta Reform Agreement, BC MOU and BC Service Agreement. AANDC argues these agreements are not evidence of how the province funds the off reserve population or evidence that AANDC underfunds FNCFS Agencies. However, these arguments do not address the fact that FNCFS Agencies are funded in a different manner than the reimbursements provided by AANDC to the provinces. The funding provided to Alberta and British Columbia under these agreements is not based on population levels or assumptions about children in care and families in need. Rather, those provinces are reimbursed for the actual costs or an agreed upon share of the costs for providing child and family services. They receive adjustments for inflation and increases in the costs of services, whereas FNCFS Agencies do not. Most importantly, because of the payment of actuals and adjustments thereof annually, there is a more direct connection between the child and family services standards of those provinces and the delivery of those services to the First Nation communities they serve.\n[334] By comparison, neither Directive 20-1 nor the EPFA provide adjustments for the cost of living or for changes in provincial legislation and standards. Both types of adjustments were identified by Wen:De Report Two as major flaws in Directives 20-1 and, despite these findings, the EPFA model incorporated these same flaws. As Wen:De Report Two specified, not adjusting funding for increases in the cost of living leads to both under-funding of services and to distortion in the services funded (see at p. 45). Furthermore, by not providing adjustments for changing provincial legislation and standards, the FNCFS Program still contains no mechanism to ensure child and family services provided on reserve are reasonably comparable to those provided to children in similar circumstances off reserve (see Wen:De Report Two at p. 50).\n[335] AANDC\u2019s argument about the Complainants\u2019 lack of comparative evidence also ignores the fact that the NPR, Wen:De reports, Auditor General and Standing Committee reports have all identified a need for AANDC to do this analysis and recommended they do so. Moreover, in response to the Auditor General and Standing Committee reports recommending AANDC perform a comparative analysis of child welfare services provided on and off reserve, AANDC indicated that it has not done so because of inherent difficulties in doing so. Despite said difficulties, \u201creasonable comparability\u201d remains AANDC\u2019s standard for the FNCFS Program.\n[336] The difficulties in performing this comparative analysis were also identified in a document entitled Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, authored by AANDC employees and to be included in a Ministerial Briefing Binder (see Annex, ex. 44). The document explains that for a number of reasons, such as differences in the way social programs are delivered in the provinces in terms of types of services, the number of services and the allocation of funding, it is difficult to arrive at conclusive and comparable numbers (see Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding at p. 1). In addition, provincial data may not be directly comparable as it could include costs such as overhead or program costs not funded through the FNCFS Program (see Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding at p. 4). Where total expenditures per child in care are compared, there is some indication that AANDC funds child and family services at higher levels compared to some provinces. However, the Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding document, at page 4, notes that funding levels do not relate to the real needs of children and their families:\nthis analysis is not able to recognize that disadvantaged groups may have higher levels of need for services (due to poverty, poor housing conditions, high levels of substance abuse, and exposure to family violence) or that the services or placement options they require may be at a substantially higher cost for services.\n[337] Ms. D\u2019Amico also testified about the difficulty in comparing services provided by FNCFS Agencies to those provided by the provinces:\nMS CHAN: [\u2026] Can you tell, or is there a way for the Program to know if they are comparable in terms of the services that are being provided on-Reserve?\nMS D'AMICO: I don't believe that we can.\n[\u2026]\nBecause we are talking about different types of communities, different types of systems and different types of services that are being administered by different service delivery agents. So what I mean by this is, one First Nation community off-Reserve who looks exactly the same as an off-Reserve community isn't actually going to get the same services as that other community, they are going to get culturally specific services that that Agency deems appropriate for the children and families that they are serving.\n(Transcript Vol. 51 at p. 183)\n[338] Because of these difficulties, Ms. D\u2019Amico indicated that AANDC\u2019s funding is not premised on comparability of service levels between on and off reserve child and family services, but simply on maintaining comparable funding levels with the province:\nMS D'AMICO: Because in the case of EPFA we have -- we are currently funding at the same salaries and staffing ratios as the province, and that is the only comparable variables that we could find. So it has nothing to do with the service delivery, it has to do with the funding, and that -- and so we have found comparable variables that the province how the province funds is how we fund.\n(Transcript Vol. 51 at p. 103)\n[339] However, as indicated above, even salaries are fixed when the EPFA is implemented and in Alberta, for example, they are still using 2006 salary rates in 2014. Furthermore, as indicated in the Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding document, an approach to comparability based on funding and not service levels does not recognize the higher levels of need for services for First Nations or that the services or placement options they require may be at a substantially higher cost.\n[340] This last point allows the Panel to make an effective comparison between the child and family services offered on and off reserve based on the principle of the best interest of the child.\niv. Best interest of the child and Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[341] There is a focus on service levels and the needs of children and families off reserve, namely an emphasis on least disruptive\/intrusive measures. On the other hand, under the federal FNCFS Program, there is a focus on funding levels and the application of funding formulas, where funds for prevention\/least disruptive measures are fixed and funds to bring a child into care are covered at cost.\n[342] Provincial child welfare legislation and standards focus on prevention and least disruptive measures (see for example Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act at s. 1; Alberta\u2019s Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act at s. 2; The Child and Family Services Act in Manitoba at Declaration of Principles and s. 2; The Child and Family Services Act in Saskatchewan at ss. 3-5; Nova Scotia\u2019s Children and Family Services Act at Preamble and ss. 2, 13, 20; British Columbia\u2019s Child, Family and Community Service Act at ss.2-4, 30; and, Quebec\u2019s Loi sur la Protection de la Jeunesse at ss. 1-4). These statutes recognize that removing a child from his or her family, home or community should only be done when all other least disruptive measures have been exhausted and there is no other alternative.\n[343] This focus on least disruptive measures recognizes the significant effect of separating a family. The Supreme Court, in Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. K.L.W., 2000 SCC 48 at paragraph 78, outlined the effects of bringing a child into care:\nThe most disruptive form of intervention is a court order giving the agency temporary or permanent guardianship of a child. Particularly in the case of a permanent order, this may sever legal ties between parent and child forever. To make such an order, a court must find that the child is in need of protection within the meaning of the applicable statute. In addition, the court must find that the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d dictate a temporary or permanent transfer of guardianship. As Lamer C.J. observed in G. (J.), supra, at para. 76: \u201cFew state actions can have a more profound effect on the lives of both parent and child.\u201d\n(Emphasis added)\n[344] As indicated above, the provinces\u2019 legislation and standards dictate that all alternatives measures should be explored before bringing a child into care, which is consistent with sound social work practice as described earlier. However, by covering maintenance expenses at cost and providing insufficient fixed budgets for prevention, AANDC\u2019s funding formulas provide an incentive to remove children from their homes as a first resort rather than as a last resort. For some FNCFS Agencies, especially those under Directive 20-1, their level of funding makes it difficult if not impossible to provide prevention and least disruptive measures. Even under the EPFA, where separate funding is provided for prevention, the formula does not provide adjustments for increasing costs over time for such things as salaries, benefits, capital expenditures, cost of living, and travel. This makes it difficult for FNCFS Agencies to attract and retain staff and, generally, to keep up with provincial requirements. Where the assumptions built into the applicable funding formulas in terms of children in care, families in need and population levels are not reflective of the actual needs of the First Nation community, there is even less of a possibility for FNCFS Agencies to keep pace with provincial operational requirements that may include, along with the items just mentioned, costs for legal or band representation, insurance premiums, and changes to provincial\/territorial service standards.\n[345] AANDC officials working in the FNCFS Program have indicated that they are not experts in the field of child welfare and, instead, rely on provincial legislation and standards to dictate the level of funding that should be provided on reserves. Yet, they apply a formula to fund FNCFS Agencies that does not take into account the standards for least disruptive measures set by provincial legislation. Tellingly, in funding child and family services, the provinces do not apply a funding formula:\nMS CHAN: In terms of funding, have you seen provincial funding formulas to calculate child welfare payment that is made by the province?\nMS D'AMICO: Not to date.\nMS CHAN: What difficulties does this cause for the Program, if any, in determining how you are going to fund?\nMS D'AMICO: So this has been our primary challenge, to try and figure out how to fund equitably or comparably because we have consistently asked the province, give us a funding formula for an Agency or for a regional office in your jurisdiction and show us what that is and we will see if we can replicate it, then we would be assured that, you know, infamous provincial comparability.\n[\u2026]\nThe provinces don't have that, they have a chart of accounts, they fund based on a variety of different things. You know, an example would be British Columbia, they have five different regional offices; those five different regional offices have different salary grids, they have different operational budgets that are not based on any particular formula.\nSo it has been incredibly challenging to find those comparable pieces so that we can ensure comparability. It has just been -- it's literally apples and oranges.\nSo, like I said, it's those variables [\u2026] that we have been able to find with the province to be able to inject in our formula so that at least we could have, first of all, a consistent formula across the country, but one that is tailored to every single jurisdiction based on provincial comparability, provincial variables.\nSo it's not absolute in terms of service. If a service is provided in one community, it's not necessarily being provided in another community even off-Reserve. It's very difficult and the services vary, there is so many different things that child protection and other community partners provide in the vast spectrum of the social safety net.\n(Transcript Vol. 51 at pp. 184-186)\n[346] A focus on prevention services and least disruptive measures in the provincial statutes mentioned above is inextricably linked to the concept of the best interest of the child: a legal principle of paramount importance in both Canadian and international law (see Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4 at para. 9; and, Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para. 75 [Baker]). As explained by Professor Nicholas Bala:\n[L]eading Canadian precedents, federal and provincial statutes and international treaties are all premised on the principle that decisions about children should be based on an assessment of their best interests. This is a central concept for those who are involved making decisions about children, not only for judges and lawyers, but for also assessors and mediators.\n(Bala, Nicholas, \u201cThe Best Interests of the Child in the Post\u2011Modernist Era: A Central but Illusive and Limited Concept\u201d, in Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada 2000: Family Law (Toronto: LSUC, 1999) at p. 3.1)\n[347] With regard to the FNCFS Program, there is discordance between on one hand, its objectives of providing culturally relevant child and family services on reserve, that are reasonably comparable to those provided off reserve, and that are in accordance with the best interest of the child and keeping families together; and, on the other hand, the actual application of the program through Directive 20-1 and the EPFA. Again, while maintenance expenditures are covered at cost, prevention and least disruptive measures funding is provided on a fixed cost basis and without consideration of the specific needs of communities or the individual families and children residing therein.\n[348] The discordance between the objectives and the actual implementation of the program is also exemplified by the lack of funding in Ontario, for Band Representatives under the 1965 Agreement. Not only does the Band Representative address the need for culturally relevant services, but it also addresses the goal of keeping families and communities together and is directly provided for in Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act.\n[349] The adverse impacts outlined throughout the preceding pages are a result of AANDC\u2019s control over the provision of child and family services on First Nations reserves and in the Yukon by the application of the funding formulas under the FNCFS Program and 1965 Agreement. Those formulas are structured in such a way that they promote negative outcomes for First Nations children and families, namely the incentive to take children into care. The result is many First Nations children and families are denied the opportunity to remain together or be reunited in a timely manner.\n[350] In this regard, and in addressing the difference between the allocation of funding by AANDC for First Nations child and family services and that of the provinces, another important consideration brought forward by the Complainants and in the evidence is the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[351] Jordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first principle and provides that where a government service is available to all other children and a jurisdictional dispute arises between Canada and a province\/territory, or between departments in the same government regarding services to a First Nations child, the government department of first contact pays for the service and can seek reimbursement from the other government\/department after the child has received the service. It is meant to prevent First Nations children from being denied essential public services or experiencing delays in receiving them.\n[352] Jordan\u2019s Principle is in recognition of Jordan River Anderson, a child who was born to a family of the Norway House Cree Nation in 1999. Jordan had a serious medical condition, and because of a lack of services on reserve, Jordan\u2019s family surrendered him to provincial care in order to get the medical treatment he needed. After spending the first two years of his life in a hospital, he could have gone into care at a specialized foster home close to his medical facilities in Winnipeg. However, for the next two years, AANDC, Health Canada and the Province of Manitoba argued over who should pay for Jordan\u2019s foster home costs and Jordan remained in hospital. They were still arguing when Jordan passed away, at the age of five, having spent his entire life in hospital.\n[353] On October 31, 2007, Ms. Jean Crowder, the Member of Parliament for Nanaimo-Cowichan, brought forward motion 296 in the House of Commons:\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should immediately adopt a child first principle, based on Jordan's Principle, to resolve jurisdictional disputes involving the care of First Nations children.\nThe motion was unanimously passed on December 12, 2007 (see Annex, ex. 45).\n[354] In response, AANDC and Health Canada entered into the Memorandum of Understanding on the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle (see Annex, ex. 46 [2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle]; see also testimony of C. Baggley, Transcript Vol. 57 at pp. 9-13, 23, 40-41, 84-85). In the 2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, signed by an Assistant Deputy Minister for each department, both AANDC and Health Canada acknowledge that they have a role to play in Jordan\u2019s Principle and a shared responsibility in working together to develop and implement a federal response (see at p. 1). The purpose of the memorandum is to act as a guide for the two departments in addressing\/resolving funding disputes as they arise between the federal and provincial governments, as well as between the two departments, \u201c\u2026ensuring that services to children identified in a Jordan\u2019s Principle case are not interrupted as a result of disputes\u201d (2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at p. 1).\n[355] The memorandum also serves as a guide for AANDC and Health Canada to collaborate on the federal implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle. In this regard, the memorandum indicates that Health Canada\u2019s role in responding to Jordan\u2019s Principle is by virtue of the range of health-related services it provides to First Nations people, including: nursing services; home and community care; community programs; and, medically necessary non-insured health benefits. AANDC\u2019s role in responding to Jordan\u2019s Principle is by virtue of the range of social programs it provides to First Nations people, including: special education; assisted living; income assistance; and, the FNCFS Program (see 2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at pp. 1-2).\n[356] Once a possible Jordan\u2019s Principle case is identified, the 2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle provides for a review of existing federal authorities and program policies to determine whether the expenditures are eligible under an existing program and can be paid through existing departmental funds. If the dispute over funding arises between the federal and provincial governments, Health Canada and AANDC are to work together to engage and collaborate with the province and First Nations representatives to resolve the dispute through a case management approach. To ensure there is no disruption\/delay in service, Health Canada was allocated $11 million to fund goods\/services while the dispute is being resolved (see 2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at p. 2). The funds were provided annually, in $3 million increments, from 2009 to 2012. The funds were never accessed and have since been discontinued (see testimony of C. Baggley, Transcript Vol. 57 at pp. 123-125).\n[357] According to the 2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, a governance structure has been developed to support communication and information-sharing between the two departments on matters related to Jordan\u2019s Principle. This governance structure includes \u201c\u2026supporting the resolution of departmental disputes where HC and AANDC are uncertain or do not agree on which department\/jurisdiction is responsible for funding the goods\/services based on their respective mandates, policies and authorities\u201d (2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at p. 2). The governance structure was also established to ensure that funding disputes are addressed and coordinated in a timely manner: timing to address case needs and make decisions being \u201c\u2026crucial to ensuring that funding disputes do not disrupt services provided to a child (2009 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at p. 3).\n[358] Health Canada and AANDC renewed their Memorandum of Understanding on the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle in January 2013 (see Annex, ex. 47 [2013 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle]). Again, signed by an Assistant Deputy Minister from each department, the 2013 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle acknowledges that Health Canada and AANDC \u201c\u2026have a role to play in supporting improved integration and linkages between federal and provincial health and social services\u201d (2013 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle at p. 1). The 2013 MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle now provides that during the resolution of a Jordan\u2019s Principle case, the federal department within whose mandate the implicated programs or service falls will seek Assistant Deputy Minister approval to fund on an interim basis to ensure continuity of service.\n[359] Ms. Corinne Baggley, Senior Policy Manager for the Children and Family Directorate of the Social Policy and Programs branch of AANDC indicated that the federal response to Jordan\u2019s Principle is focused on cases involving a jurisdictional dispute between a provincial government and the federal government and on children with multiple disabilities requiring services from multiple service providers. Furthermore, the service in question must be a service that would be available to a child residing off reserve in the same location (see Transcript Vol. 57 at pp. 9-13; see also Annex, ex. 48). While she estimated that approximately half of the cases tracked under the Jordan\u2019s Principle initiative involved disputes between federal departments, she indicated that the policy was built specifically around Jordan\u2019s case (see Transcript Vol. 58 pp. 24-25, 40-41).\n[360] The Complainants claim AANDC and Health Canada\u2019s formulation of Jordan's Principle has narrowly restricted the principle. Whereas the motion was framed broadly in terms of services needed by children, AANDC and Health Canada\u2019s formulation applies only to inter-governmental disputes and to children with multiple disabilities.\n[361] On the other hand, AANDC is of the view that Jordan\u2019s Principle is not a child welfare concept and is not a part of the FNCFS Program. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this Complaint. AANDC also argues that the FNCFS Program does not aim to address all social needs on reserve as there are a number of other social programs that meet those needs and are available to First Nations on reserve. Moreover, the FNCFS Program authorities do not allow them to pay for an expense that would normally be reimbursed by another program (i.e. the stacking provisions in the 2012 National Social Programs Manual at p. 10, section 11.0). In any event, AANDC argues there is no evidence to suggest that its approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle results in adverse impacts.\n[362] In the Panel\u2019s view, while not strictly a child welfare concept, Jordan\u2019s Principle is relevant and often intertwined with the provision of child and family services to First Nations, including under the FNCFS Program. Wen:De Report Three specifically recommended the implementation of Jordan Principle on the following basis, at page 16:\nJurisdictional disputes between federal government departments and between federal government departments and provinces have a significant and negative effect on the safety and well-being of Status Indian children [\u2026] the number of disputes that agencies experience each year is significant. In Phase 2, where this issue was explored in more depth, the 12 FNCFSA in the sample experienced a total of 393 jurisdictional disputes in the past year alone. Each one took about 50.25 person hours to resolve resulting in a significant tax on the already limited human resources.\n(Emphasis added)\n[363] Wen:De Report Two indicated that 36% of jurisdictional disputes are between federal government departments, 27% between provincial departments and only 14% were between federal and provincial governments (see at p. 38). Some of these disputes took up to 200 hours of staff time to sort out: \u201c[t]he human resource costs related to resolving jurisdictional disputes make them an extraordinary cost for agencies which is not covered in the formula\u201d (Wen:De Report Two at p. 26).\n[364] Jordan\u2019s Principle also relates to the lack of coordination of social and health services on reserve. That is, like Jordan, due to a lack of social and health services on reserve, children are placed in care in order for them to access the services they need. As noted in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, at pages 12 and 17:\n4.20 Child welfare may be complicated by social problems or health issues. We found that First Nations agencies cannot always rely on other social and health services to help keep a family together or provide the necessary services. Access to such services differs not only on and off reserves but among First Nations as well. INAC has not determined what other social and health services are available on reserves to support child welfare services. On-reserve child welfare services cannot be comparable if they have to deal with problems that, off reserves, would be addressed by other social and health services.\n[\u2026]\n4.40 First Nations children with a high degree of medical need are in an ambiguous situation. Some children placed into care may not need protection but may need extensive medical services that are not available on reserves. By placing these children in care outside of their First Nations communities, they can have access to the medical services they need. INAC is working with Health Canada to collect more information about the extent of such cases and their costs.\n[365] The 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, at page 16, also found that coordination amongst AANDC programs, and between AANDC and Health Canada programs, is poor:\n4.38 As the protection and well-being of First Nations children may require support from other programs, we expected that INAC would facilitate coordination between the [FNCFS] Program and other relevant INAC programs, and facilitate access to other federal programs as appropriate.\n4.39 We found fundamental differences between the views of INAC and Health Canada on responsibility for funding Non-Insured Health Benefits for First Nations children who are placed in care. According to INAC, the services available to these children before they are placed in care should continue to be available. According to Health Canada, however, an on-reserve child in care should have access to all programs and services available to any child in care in a province, and INAC should take full financial responsibility for these costs in accordance with federal policy. INAC says it does not have the authority to fund services that are covered by Health Canada. These differences in views can have an impact on the availability, timing, and level of services to First Nations children. For example, it took nine months for a First Nations agency to receive confirmation that an $11,000 piece of equipment for a child in care would be paid for by INAC.\n(Emphasis added)\n[366] For example, a four-year-old First Nations child suffered cardiac arrest and an anoxic brain injury during a routine dental examination. She became totally dependent for all activities of daily living. Before being discharged from hospital, she required significant medical equipment, including a specialized stroller, bed and mattress, a portable lift and a ceiling track system. A request was made to Health Canada\u2019s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program requesting approval for the medical equipment. However, the equipment was not eligible under the program and required approval as a special exemption.\n[367] An intake form disclosed during the hearing and prepared by provincial authorities in Manitoba, but which accords with AANDC\u2019s records of the incident, documents how the case proceeded thereafter (see Annex, ex. 49 [Intake Form]; see also Annex, ex. 50; and, testimony of C. Baggley, Transcript Vol. 58 at pp. 58-60). Initial contact was made with AANDC on November 29, 2012. A conference call was held on December 4, 2012, where Health Canada accepted to pay for the portable lift, but would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d pay for the specialized bed and mattress. On December 19, 2012, the child was discharged from hospital. Over a month later, the specialized bed and mattress were provided, but only as a result of an anonymous donation. In the concluding remarks of the Intake Form, where it asks \u201c[p]lease provide details on the barriers experienced to access the required services\u201d it states at page 8:\nHealth Canada does not have the authority to fund hospital or specialized beds and mattresses. NIHB said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d.\nAANDC ineligible through In Home Care (only provide for non medical supports) and family not in receipt of Income Assistance Program to access special needs funding.\nSouthern Regional Health Authority (provincial) was approached but indicated they are unable to fund the hospital bed.\nSandy Bay First Nation does not have the funding or has limited funding and is unable to purchase bed.\nJurisdictions lacking funding authority to cover certain items which result in gaps and disparities.\n[368] The lack of integration between federal government programs on reserve, in more areas than only with children with multiple disabilities, is highlighted in an AANDC document entitled INAC and Health Canada First Nation Programs: Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region (see Annex, ex. 51 [Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region]). As indicated in the accompanying email message attaching the document, under the subject line \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle: Parallel work with HC\u201d, the document represents the views of AANDC\u2019s British Columbia regional office, including its Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, and is informed by other experienced officials within the regional office.\n[369] The Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region document indicates at page 1:\nThe work of the two departments on Jordan\u2019s Principle has highlighted what all of us knew from years of experience: that there are differences of opinion, authorities and resources between the two departments that appear to cause gaps in service to children and families resident on reserve. The main programs at issue include INAC\u2019s Income Assistance program and the Child and Family Services program; for Health Canada, it is Non-Insured Health Benefits program.\n[370] The document goes on to identify gaps based on the first-hand experience of AANDC officials and FNCFS Agencies. For example, once a child is in care, the FNCFS Program cannot recover costs for Non-Insured Health Benefits from Health Canada. In that situation, Health Canada deems that there is another source of coverage (the FNCFS Program); however, AANDC does not have authority to pay for medical-related expenditures. Generally, there is confusion in how to access non-insured health benefits (i.e. where to get the forms; where to send the forms and who to call for questions given the official website does not give contact information) (see Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region at pp. 1-2).\n[371] Dental services are also identified as an area of contention for FNCFS Agencies and First Nations individuals. Even in emergency situations, basic dental care is denied by the Non-Insured Health Benefits program if pre-approval is not obtained. If pressed, Health Canada advises clients to appeal the decision which can create additional delays. When a child in care is involved however, the FNCFS Agency has no choice but to pay for the work (see Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region at p. 2).\n[372] Another medical related expenditure identified as a concern is mental health services. Health Canada\u2019s funding for mental health services is for short term mental health crises, whereas children in care often require ongoing mental health needs and those services are not always available on reserve. Therefore, children in care are not accessing mental health services due to service delays, limited funding and time limits on the service. To exacerbate the situation for some children, if they cannot get necessary mental health services, they are unable to access school-based programs for children with special needs that require an assessment\/diagnosis from a psychologist (see Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region at pp. 2-3).\n[373] In some cases, the FNCFS Program is paying for eligible Non-Insured Health Benefits expenditures even though they are not eligible expenses under the FNCFS Program (see Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region at pp. 2-3). This is problematic considering AANDC has to reallocate funds from some of its other programs - which address underlying risk factors for First Nations children - in order to pay for maintenance costs. Again, as the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada pointed out at page 25:\n4.72 Because the program\u2019s expenditures are growing faster than the Department\u2019s overall budget, INAC has had to reallocate funding from other programs. In a 2006 study, the Department acknowledged that over the past decade, budget reallocations\u2014from programs such as community infrastructure and housing to other programs such as child welfare\u2014have meant that spending on housing has not kept pace with growth in population and community infrastructure has deteriorated at a faster rate.\n4.73 In our view, the budgeting approach INAC currently uses for this type of program is not sustainable. Program budgeting needs to meet government policy and allow all parties to fulfill their obligations under the program and provincial legislation, while minimizing the impact on other important departmental programs. The Department has taken steps in Alberta to deal with these issues and is committed to doing the same in other provinces by 2012.\n[374] As mentioned above, AANDC\u2019s own evaluations of the FNCFS Program have also identified this issue. The 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program identified the FNCFS Program as one of five AANDC programs that have the potential to improve the well-being of children, families and communities. The other four are the Family Violence Prevention Program, the Assisted Living Program, the National Child Benefit Reinvestment Program and the Income Assistance Program. According to the evaluation, \u201c[i]t is possible that, with better coordination, these programs could be used more strategically to support families and help them address the issues most often associated with child maltreatment\u201d (2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program at p. 38). In addition, the evaluation identifies other federal programs for First Nations who live on reserve offered by Human Resources and Social Development Canada, Justice Canada and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, along with Health Canada, that also directly contribute to healthy families and communities (see 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program at pp. 39-45). On this basis, the 2007 Evaluation of the FNCFS Program, at pages 47-48, proposes three approaches to FNCFS Program improvement:\nApproach A: Resolve weaknesses in the current FNCFS funding formula, Program Directive 20-1, because in its current form, it discourages agencies from a differential response approach and encourages out-of-home child placements.\nApproach B: Besides resolving weaknesses in Program Directive 20-1, encourage First Nations communities to develop comprehensive community plans for involving other INAC social programs in child maltreatment prevention. The five INAC programs (the FNCFS Program, the Assisted Living Program, the National Child Benefit Reinvestment Program, the Family Violence Prevention Program, and the Income Assistance Program) all target the same First Nations communities, and they all have a role to play in improving outcomes for children and families, so their efforts should be coordinated and a performance indicator for all of them under INAC\u2019s new performance framework for social programs should be the rate of child maltreatment in on-reserve First Nation communities.\nApproach C: In addition to approaches A and B, improve coordination of INAC social programs with those of other federal departments that are directed to First Nations on reserve, for example health and early childhood development programs. With greater coordination and a stronger focus on the needs of individual communities, these programs could make a greater contribution to child maltreatment prevention, and could be part of a broader healthy community initiative.\n[375] Similarly, the 2010 AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Alberta found several jurisdictional issues as challenging the effectiveness of service delivery, notably the availability and access to supportive services for prevention. In 2012, the AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia found that \u201c[t]here is a need to better coordinate federal programming that affects children and parents requiring child and family services\u201d (at p. 49). The AANDC Evaluation of the Implementation of the EPFA in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, at page 49, goes on to state:\nIt is clear that the FNCFS Program does not and cannot work in isolation from other programming. Too many factors affect the overall need for child and family services programming, and it would be unrealistic to assume that agencies can fully deliver services related to all of them. AANDC could improve its efficiency by having a better understanding of other AANDC or federal programming that affect children and parents requiring child and family services and facilitating the coordination of these programs. Economic development, health promotion, education and cultural integrity are key areas where an integration of programming and services has been noted as potentially addressing community well-being in a way that is both effective and necessary for positive long-term outcomes, and ultimately a sustained reduction in the number of children coming into care.\n[376] Jordan\u2019s Principle was also considered by the Federal Court in Pictou Landing Band Council v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FC 342. The Pictou Landing Band Council (the PLBC) applied for judicial review of an AANDC decision not to reimburse them for in-home health care to one of its members. The PLBC indicated that Jordan\u2019s Principle was at issue. However, after case conferencing with the provincial government and officials from the PLBC, AANDC and Health Canada determined there was no jurisdictional dispute in the matter as both levels of government agreed that the funding requested was above what would be provided to a child living off reserve.\n[377] The Federal Court found AANDC\u2019s interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle to be narrow and the finding that it was not engaged to be unreasonable:\n[96] In this case, there is a legislatively mandated provincial assistance policy regarding provision of home care services for exceptional cases concerning persons with multiple handicaps which is not available on reserve.\n[97] The Nova Scotia Court held an off reserve person with multiple handicaps is entitled to receive home care services according to his needs. His needs were exceptional and the [Social Assistance Act] and its Regulations provide for exceptional cases. Yet a severely handicapped teenager on a First Nation reserve is not eligible, under express provincial policy, to be considered despite being in similar dire straits. This, in my view, engages consideration under Jordan\u2019s Principle which exists precisely to address situations such as Jeremy\u2019s.\n[378] In determining that AANDC and Health Canada did not properly assess the PLBC request for funding to meet its member\u2019s needs, the Federal Court concluded that:\n[111] I am satisfied that the federal government took on the obligation espoused in Jordan\u2019s Principle. As result, I come to much the same conclusions as the Court in Boudreau. The federal government contribution agreements required the PLBC to deliver programs and services in accordance with the same standards of provincial legislation and policy. The [Social Assistance Act] and Regulations require the providing provincial department to provide assistance, home services, in accordance with the needs of the person who requires those services. PLBC did. Jeremy does. As a consequence, I conclude AANDC and Health Canada must provide reimbursement to the PLBC.\n[\u2026]\n[116] Jordan\u2019s Principle is not an open ended principle. It requires complimentary social or health services be legally available to persons off reserve. It also requires assessment of the services and costs that meet the needs of the on reserve First Nation child.\n[379] Jordan\u2019s Principle is designed to address issues of jurisdiction which can result in delay, disruption and\/or denial of a good or service for First Nations children on reserve. The 2009 and 2013 Memorandums of Understanding have delays inherently built into them by including a review of policy and programs, case conferencing and approvals from the Assistant Deputy Minister, before interim funding is even provided. It should be noted that the case conferencing approach was what was used in Jordan\u2019s case, sadly, without success (see testimony of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Transcript Vol. 48 at p. 104).\n[380] It also unclear why AANDC`s position focuses mainly on inter-governmental disputes in situations where a child has multiple disabilities requiring services from multiple service providers. The evidence above indicates that a large number of jurisdictional disputes occur between federal departments, such as AANDC, Health Canada and others. Tellingly, the $11 million Health Canada fund to address Jordan\u2019s Principle cases was never accessed. According to Ms. Baggley, the reasons for this were that the cases coming forward did not meet the criteria for the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle; or, were resolved before having to access the fund (see Transcript Vol. 57 at pp. 123-125).\n[381] In the Panel\u2019s view, it is Health Canada\u2019s and AANDC\u2019s narrow interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle that results in there being no cases meeting the criteria for Jordan\u2019s Principle. This interpretation does not cover the extent to which jurisdictional gaps may occur in the provision of many federal services that support the health, safety and well-being of First Nations children and families. Such an approach defeats the purpose of Jordan\u2019s Principle and results in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children on reserve. Coordination amongst all federal departments and programs, especially AANDC and Health Canada programs, would help avoid these gaps in services to First Nations children in need.\n[382] More importantly, Jordan\u2019s Principle is meant to apply to all First Nations children. There are many other First Nations children without multiple disabilities who require services, including child and family services. Having to put a child in care in order to access those services, when those services are available to all other Canadians is one of the main reasons this Complaint was made.\nv. Summary of findings\n[383] The FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements intend to provide funding to ensure the safety and well-being of First Nations children on reserve by supporting culturally appropriate child and family services that are meant to be in accordance with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards and be provided in a reasonably comparable manner to those provided off-reserve in similar circumstances. However, the evidence above indicates that AANDC is far from meeting these intended goals and, in fact, that First Nations are adversely impacted and, in some cases, denied adequate child welfare services by the application of the FNCFS Program and other funding methods.\n[384] Under the FNCFS Program, Directive 20-1 has a number of shortcomings and creates incentives to remove children from their homes and communities. Mainly, Directive 20-1 makes assumptions based on population thresholds and children in care to fund the operations budgets of FNCFS Agencies. These assumptions ignore the real child welfare situation in many First Nations\u2019 communities on reserve. Whereas operations budgets are fixed, maintenance budgets for taking children into care are reimbursable at cost. If an FNCFS Agency does not have the funds to provide services through its operations budget, often times the only way to provide the necessary child and family services is to bring the child into care. For small and remote agencies, the population thresholds of Directive 20-1 significantly reduce their operations budgets, affecting their ability to provide effective programming, respond to emergencies and, for some, put them in jeopardy of closing.\n[385] Directive 20-1 has not been significantly updated since the mid-1990\u2019s resulting in underfunding for FNCFS agencies and inequities for First Nations children and families on reserves and in the Yukon. In addition, Directive 20-1 is not in line with current provincial child welfare legislation and standards promoting prevention and least disruptive measures for children and families. As a result, many First Nations children and their families are denied an equitable opportunity to remain with their families or to be reunited in a timely manner. In 2008, at the time of the Complaint, the vast majority of FNCFS Agencies across Canada functioned under Directive 20-1. At the conclusion of the hearing in 2014, Directive 20-1 was still applicable in three provinces and in the Yukon Territory.\n[386] AANDC incorporated some of the same shortcomings of Directive 20-1 into the EPFA, such as the assumptions about children in care and population levels, along with the fixed streams of funding for operations and prevention. Despite being aware of these shortcomings in Directive 20-1 based on numerous reports, AANDC has not followed the recommendations in those reports and has perpetuated the main shortcoming of the FNCFS Program: the incentive to take children into care - to remove them from their families.\n[387] Furthermore, like Directive 20-1, the EPFA has not been consistently updated in an effort to keep it current with the child welfare legislation and practices of the applicable provinces. Once EPFA is implemented, no adjustments to funding for inflation\/cost of living or for changing service standards are applied to help address increased costs over time and to ensure that prevention-based investments more closely match the full continuum of child welfare services provided off reserve. In contrast, when AANDC funds the provinces directly, things such as inflation and other general costs increases are reimbursed, providing a closer link to the service standards of the applicable province\/territory.\n[388] In terms of ensuring reasonably comparable child and family services on reserve to the services provided off reserve, the FNCFS Program has a glaring flaw. While FNCFS Agencies are required to comply with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards, the FNCFS Program funding authorities are not based on provincial\/territorial legislation or service standards. Instead, they are based on funding levels and formulas that can be inconsistent with the applicable legislation and standards. They also fail to consider the actual service needs of First Nations children and families, which are often higher than those off reserve. Moreover, the way in which the funding formulas and the program authorities function prevents an effective comparison with the provincial systems. The provinces\/territory often do not use funding formulas and the way they manage cost variables is often very different. Instead of modifying its system to effectively adapt it to the provincial\/territorial systems in order to achieve reasonable comparability; AANDC maintains its funding formulas and incorporates the few variables it has managed to obtain from the provinces\/territory, such as salaries, into those formulas.\n[389] Given the current funding structure for the FNCFS Program is not adapted to provincial\/territorial legislation and standards, it often creates funding deficiencies for such items as salaries and benefits, training, cost of living, legal costs, insurance premiums, travel, remoteness, multiple offices, capital infrastructure, culturally appropriate programs and services, band representatives, and least disruptive measures. It is difficult, if not impossible, for many FNCFS Agencies to comply with provincial\/territorial child and family services legislation and standards without appropriate funding for these items; or, in the case of many small and remote agencies, to even provide child and family services. Effectively, the FNCFS funding formulas provide insufficient funding to many FNCFS Agencies to address the needs of their clientele. AANDC\u2019s funding methodology controls their ability to improve outcomes for children and families and to ensure reasonably comparable child and family services on and off reserve. Despite various reports and evaluations of the FNCFS Program identifying AANDC\u2019s \u201creasonable comparability\u201d standard as being inadequately defined and measured, it still remains an unresolved issue for the program.\n[390] Notwithstanding budget surpluses for some agencies, additional funding or reallocations from other programs, the evidence still indicates funding is insufficient. The Panel finds AANDC\u2019s argument suggesting otherwise is unreasonable given the preponderance of evidence outlined above. In addition, the reallocation of funds from other AANDC programs, such as housing and infrastructure, to meet the maintenance costs of the FNCFS Program has been described by the Auditor General of Canada as being unsustainable and as also negatively impacting other important social programs for First Nations on reserve. Again, recommendations by the Auditor General and Standing Committee on Public Accounts on this point have largely gone unanswered by AANDC.\n[391] Furthermore, in areas where the FNCFS Program is complemented by other federal programs aimed at addressing the needs of children and families on reserve, there is also a lack of coordination between the different programs. The evidence indicates that federal government departments often work in silos. This practice results in service gaps, delays or denials and, overall, adverse impacts on First Nations children and families on reserves. Jordan\u2019s Principle was meant to address this issue; however, its narrow interpretation by AANDC and Health Canada ignores a large number of disputes that can arise and need to be addressed under this Principle.\n[392] While seemingly an improvement on Directive 20-1 and more advantageous than the EPFA, the application of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario also results in denials of services and adverse effects for First Nations children and families. For instance, given the agreement has not been updated for quite some time, it does not account for changes made over the years to provincial legislation for such things as mental health and other prevention services. This is further compounded by a lack of coordination amongst federal programs in dealing with health and social services that affect children and families in need, despite those types of programs being synchronized under Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act. The lack of surrounding services to support the delivery of child and family services on-reserve, especially in remote and isolated communities, exacerbates the gap further. There is also discordance between Ontario\u2019s legislation and standards for providing culturally appropriate services to First Nations children and families through the appointment of a Band Representative and AANDC\u2019s lack of funding thereof. Tellingly, AANDC\u2019s position is that it is not required to cost-share services that are not included in the 1965 Agreement.\n[393] Overall, AANDC\u2019s method of providing funding to ensure the safety and well-being of First Nations children on reserve and in the Yukon, by supporting the delivery of culturally appropriate child and family services that are in accordance with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards and provided in a reasonably comparable manner to those provided off reserve in similar circumstances, falls far short of its objective. In fact, the evidence demonstrates adverse effects for many First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon, including a denial of adequate child and family services, by the application of AANDC\u2019s FNCFS Program, funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements. These findings are consistent with those of the NPR, Wen:De reports, Auditor General of Canada reports and Standing Committee on Public Accounts reports. Again, the Panel accepts the findings in those reports and has relied on them to make its own findings. Those findings are also corroborated by the other testimonial and documentary evidence outlined above, including the internal documents emanating from AANDC.\n[394] As will be seen in the next section, the adverse effects generated by the FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements perpetuate disadvantages historically suffered by First Nations people.\nC. Race and\/or national or ethnic origin is a factor in the adverse impacts or denials\n[395] As mentioned above, there is no dispute in this case that First Nations possess the characteristics of race and\/or national or ethnic origin. Discrimination claims regarding Aboriginal peoples have been founded on both grounds (see for example The Queen v. Drybones, [1970] SCR 282; Bear v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 FCA 40; Bignell-Malcolm v. Ebb and Flow Indian Band, 2008 CHRT 3; and Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Blais, 2007 QCTDP 11).\n[396] The provision of child and family services under the FNCFS Program and the other provincial agreements are specifically aimed at First Nations living on reserve. Under the Yukon Agreement, the services are aimed at all First Nations living in the territory. That is, the determination of the public to which the services are offered is based uniquely on the race and\/or ethnic origin of the service recipients. Pursuant to the application of the FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and the other provincial\/territorial agreements, First Nations people living on reserve and in the Yukon are prima facie adversely differentiated and\/or denied services because of their race and\/or national or ethnic origin in the provision of child and family services.\n[397] AANDC argues there is no evidence that any changes to the FNCFS Program and corresponding funding formulas or the other related provincial\/territorial agreements would lead to better outcomes for First Nations children and families. Therefore, it argues the Complainants have failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In any event, the question of whether federal funding is sufficient to meet a perceived need is beyond the scope of an investigation into discrimination under section 5 of the CHRA.\n[398] The prima facie discrimination analysis is not concerned with proposed outcomes. It is concerned with adverse impacts and whether a prohibited ground is a factor in any adverse impacts. Proposed outcomes only come into play if the complaint is substantiated and an order from the Tribunal is required to rectify the discrimination under section 53(2) of the CHRA. The Panel also disagrees that the question of whether funding is sufficient to meet a perceived need is beyond the scope of an investigation into discrimination under the CHRA. That question and evidence related thereto informs the ultimate determination to be made in this case: whether First Nations children and families residing on-reserve have an opportunity equal with other individuals in accessing child and family services. That is, it addresses the issue of substantive equality.\ni. Substantive equality\n[399] The purpose of the CHRA is to give effect to the principle of equality. That \u201call individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society\u201d (CHRA at s. 2, emphasis added). The equality jurisprudence under section 15 of the Charter informs the content of the CHRA\u2019s equality statement (see Caring Society FCA at para. 19). In this regard, the Supreme Court has consistently held that equality is not necessarily about treating everyone the same. As mentioned above, \u201cidentical treatment may frequently produce serious inequality\u201d (Andrews at p. 164).\n[400] As articulated in Vriend v. Alberta, [1998] 1 SCR 493 at para. 69, \u201c[i]t is easy to say that everyone who is just like \u201cus\u201d is entitled to equality [\u2026] it is more difficult to say that those who are \u201cdifferent\u201d from us in some way should have the same equality rights that we enjoy\u201d. In other words, true equality and the accommodation of differences, what is termed \u2018substantive equality\u2019, will frequently require the making of distinctions (see Andrews at pp. 168-169). That is, in some cases \u201cdiscrimination can accrue from a failure to take positive steps to ensure that disadvantaged groups benefit equally from services offered to the general public\u201d (see Eldridge at para. 78).\n[401] In Eldridge, the issue was whether the failure to provide sign language interpreters for hearing impaired persons as part of a publicly funded scheme for the provision of medical care was in violation of section 15 of the Charter. The Supreme Court held that discrimination stemmed from the actions of subordinate authorities, such as hospitals, who acted as agents of the government in providing the medical services set out in legislation. However, the Legislature, in defining its objective as guaranteeing access to a range of medical services, could not evade its obligations under section 15 of the Charter to provide those services without discrimination by appointing hospitals to carry out that objective. The medical care system applied equally to the entire population of the province, but the lack of interpreters prevented hearing impaired persons from benefitting from the system to the same extent as hearing persons. The legislation was discriminatory because it had the effect of denying someone the equal protection or benefit of the law.\n[402] In determining whether there has been discrimination in a substantive sense, the analysis must also be undertaken in a purposive manner \u201c\u2026taking into account the full social, political and legal context of the claim\u201d (see Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 SCR 497 at para. 30). For Aboriginal peoples in Canada, this context includes a legacy of stereotyping and prejudice through colonialism, displacement and residential schools (see R. v. Turpin, [1989] 1 SCR 1296 at p. 1332; Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 SCR 203 at para. 66; Lovelace v. Ontario, [2000] 1 SCR 950 at para. 69; R. v. Kapp, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483 at para. 59; and, R. v. Ipeelee, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433 at para. 60).\n[403] In providing the benefit of the FNCFS Program and the other related provincial\/territorial agreements, AANDC is obliged to ensure that its involvement in the provision of child and family services does not perpetuate the historical disadvantages endured by Aboriginal peoples. If AANDC\u2019s conduct widens the gap between First Nations and the rest of Canadian society rather than narrowing it, then it is discriminatory (see A at para. 332; and, Eldridge at para. 73).\n[404] The evidence in this case not only indicates various adverse effects on First Nations children and families by the application of AANDC\u2019s FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements, but also that these adverse effects perpetuate historical disadvantages suffered by Aboriginal peoples, mainly as a result of the Residential Schools system.\nii. Impact of the Residential Schools system\n[405] Please note that the information below contains graphic facts about Residential Schools. If this information causes distress, especially for survivors and their families, a 24-hour Indian Residential Schools Crisis Line has been set up to provide support, including emotional and crisis referral services:\n1-866-925-4419\na. History of Residential Schools\n[406] Dr. John Milloy, a historian and author of A National Crime, The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 2006) [A National Crime]), was qualified as an expert on the history of Residential Schools before the Tribunal. His evidence was uncontroverted and supported by official archives and other documents referenced in his book. As such, the Panel accepts Dr. Milloy\u2019s evidence as fact.\n[407] During the Residential Schools era, Aboriginal children were removed from their homes, often forcibly, and brought to residential schools to be \u201ccivilized\u201d. Living conditions in many cases were appalling, giving place to disease, hunger, stress, and despair. Children were often cold, overworked, shamed and could not speak their native language for fear of severe punishment, including some students who had needles inserted into their tongues. Many children were verbally, sexually and\/or physically abused. There were instances where students were forced to eat their own vomit. Some children were locked in closets, cages, and basements. Others managed to run away, but some of those who did so during the winter months died in the cold weather. Many children committed suicide as a result of attending a Residential School.\n[408] Overall, a large number of Aboriginal children under the supervision of the Residential Schools system died while \u201cin-care\u201d (see A National Crime at p. 51). Many of those who managed to survive the ordeal are psychologically scarred as a result. In addition to the impacts on individuals, Dr. Milloy also explained how the Residential Schools affected First Nations communities as a whole. In losing future generations to the Residential Schools, the culture, language and the very survival of many First Nations communities was put in jeopardy.\n[409] Elder Robert Joseph, from the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw community, gave a very moving and detailed account of his personal experience in the Residential Schools system. According to Elder Joseph, abuse, strip searches, withholding gifts and visits from family members, and public shaming were very commonplace. In his view, some of the strip searches were actually veiled instances of sexual assault. In one instance, as a form of punishment, he recounted being stripped naked in front of the boys\u2019 division of the school and told to bend over. He also spoke of children being locked in closets and cages and the prevalence of racist remarks.\n[410] Elder Joseph\u2019s experience gave him a deep sense of loneliness and he turned to alcohol to cope with the despair. He has since turned his life around and is now an advocate for reconciliation and healing for Aboriginal people.\n[411] The Government of Canada has recognized the impacts and consequences of the Residential Schools system. In a 2008 Statement of Apology to former students of Residential Schools (see Annex, ex. 52), former Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated:\nThe treatment of children in Indian Residential Schools is a sad chapter in our history.\nFor more than a century, Indian Residential Schools separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities. In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate Aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools. Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, \"to kill the Indian in the child\". Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country.\n[\u2026]\nThe government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian Residential Schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage and language. While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities.\nThe legacy of Indian Residential Schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today.\n[\u2026]\nTo the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the Government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you. Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry.\nThe burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long. The burden is properly ours as a Government, and as a country. There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again. You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey. The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.\n[412] In the spirit of reconciliation, the Panel also acknowledges the suffering caused by Residential Schools. Rooted in racist and neocolonialist attitudes, the individual and collective trauma imposed on Aboriginal people by the Resident Schools system is one of the darkest aspects of Canadian history. As will be explained in the following section, the effects of Residential Schools continue to impact First Nations children, families and communities to this day.\nb. Transformation of Residential Schools into an aspect of the child welfare system\n[413] Residential Schools operated as a \u201cschool system\u201d from the 1880\u2019s until the 1960\u2019s, when it became a marked component of the child welfare system. In about 1969, the Church\u2019s involvement in the Residential Schools system ceased, and the federal government took over sole management of the institutions. At around the same time, new regulations came into effect outlining who could attend Residential Schools, placing an emphasis on orphans and \u201cneglected\u201d children. The primary role of many Residential Schools changed from a focus on \u201ceducation\u201d to a focus on \u201cchild welfare\u201d. Despite this, many children were not sent home, because their parents were assessed as not being able to assume the responsibility for the care of their children (see A National Crime at pp. 211-212; and, testimony of Dr. Milloy, Transcript Vol. 34 at pp. 19-20).\n[414] Over a 50-year period, between the 1930\u2019s to the 1980\u2019s, the number of schools declined steadily from 78 schools in 1930 down to 12 schools in 1980. The last school closed in 1986. The FNCFS Program is then implemented in 1990.\nc. Intergenerational trauma of Residential Schools\n[415] Dr. Amy Bombay, Ph.D. in neuroscience and M.Sc. in psychology, was qualified as an expert on the psychological effects and transmission of stress and trauma on wellbeing. She spoke about the intergenerational transmission of trauma among the offspring of Residential School survivors. The Panel finds Dr. Bombay\u2019s evidence reliable and helpful in understanding the impacts of the individual and collective trauma experienced by Aboriginal peoples and finds her evidence highly relevant to the case at hand.\n[416] Dr. Bombay explained how Residential Schools fits into the larger traumatic history that Aboriginal peoples have been exposed to:\n\u2026for indigenous groups in Canada and worldwide, colonialism has comprised multiple collective traumas [\u2026] these include things like military conquest, epidemic diseases and forced relocation.\nSo Indian residential schools is really just one example of one collective trauma which is part of a larger traumatic history that aboriginal peoples have already been exposed to.\n(Transcript Vol. 40 at p. 94)\n[417] According to Dr. Bombay, these collective traumas have had a cumulative effect over time, namely on individual and community health (see Transcript Vol. 40 at p. 83). In her words: \u201cthese collective effects are greater than the sum of the individual effects\u201d (Transcript Vol. 40 at p. 82). Similar effects have been shown in other populations and in other groups who have undergone similar collective traumas, such as Holocaust survivors, Japanese Americans subjected to internment during World War II, and survivors of the Turkish genocide of Armenians (see Transcript Vol. 40 at pp. 111-112). To measure and describe the fact that some groups have undergone this chronic exposure to collective traumas, Dr. Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart of the University of New Mexico coined the term \u201chistorical trauma\u201d, which is defined as \u201c\u2026the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over the lifespan across generations emanating from massive group trauma\u201d (see testimony of Dr. Bombay, Transcript Vol. 40 at pp. 94-95).\n[418] For Residential School survivors, Dr. Bombay indicated that they are more likely to suffer from various physical and mental health problems compared to Aboriginal adults who did not attend. For example, Residential School survivors report higher levels of psychological distress compared to those who did not attend, and they are also more likely to be diagnosed with a chronic physical health condition (see Transcript Vol. 40 at pp. 109-110).\n[419] With respect to social outcomes, Dr. Bombay explained some of the intergenerational impacts of Residential Schools as follows:\n\u2026numerous qualitative research studies have shown that the lack of traditional parental role models in residential schools impeded the transmission of traditional positive childrearing practices that they otherwise would have learned from their parents, and that seeing -- being exposed to the neglect and abuse and the poor treatment that a lot of the caregivers in residential schools -- how they treated the children, actually instilled negative -- a lot of negative parenting practices, as this was the only models of parenting that they were exposed to.\n(Transcript Vol. 40 at p. 110)\n[420] Generationally, the above noted impacts could descend from the Residential School survivor, to their children and then to their grandchildren. In this regard, Dr. Bombay indicated, relying on the 2002-2003 Regional Health Survey, that 43% of First Nations adults on-reserve perceived that their parents\u2019 attendance at Residential School negatively affected the parenting that they received while growing up; 73.4% believed that their grandparents\u2019 attendance at Residential School negatively affected the parenting that their parents received; 37.2% of First Nations adults whose parents attended Residential School had contemplated suicide in their life versus 25.7% whose parents did not; and, the grandchildren of survivors were also at an increased risk for suicide as 28.4% had attempted suicide versus only 13.1% of those whose grandparents did not attend Residential School (see Transcript at Vol. 40 pp. 110-11, 114-115).\n[421] In her own recent comprehensive research assessing the health and well-being of First Nations people living on reserve, Dr. Bombay found that children of Residential School survivors reported greater adverse childhood experiences and greater traumas in adulthood, all of which appeared to contribute to greater depressive symptoms in Residential School offspring (see Annex, ex. 53 at p. 373; see also Transcript Vol. 40 at pp. 69, 71).\n[422] Dr. Bombay\u2019s evidence helps inform the child and family services needs of Aboriginal peoples. Generally, it reinforces the higher level of need for those services on- reserves. By focusing on bringing children into care, the FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements perpetuate the damage done by Residential Schools rather than attempting to address past harms. The history of Residential Schools and the intergenerational trauma it has caused is another reason - on top of some of the other underlying risk factors affecting Aboriginal children and families such as poverty and poor infrastructure - that exemplify the additional need of First Nations people to receive adequate child and family services, including least disruptive measures and, especially, services that are culturally appropriate.\n[423] AANDC submits that in determining what services to provide and how to deliver them, the FNCFS Agencies decide what is \u201cculturally appropriate\u201d for their community. The definition of what is culturally appropriate depends on the specific culture of each First Nation community. According to AANDC, this is best left to the discretion of the FNCFS Agencies or First Nations leadership.\n[424] However, in the 2008 Report of the Auditor General of Canada, the Auditor General indicated that \u201c[t]o deliver this program as the policy requires, we expected that the Department would, at a minimum know what \u201cculturally appropriate services\u201d means\u201d (at s. 4.18, p. 12). That is, AANDC had no assurances that the FNCFS Program funds child welfare services that are culturally appropriate. In response, AANDC developed a guiding principle for what it understands culturally appropriate services to be:\nthe Government of Canada provides funding, as a matter of social policy, to support the delivery of culturally appropriate services among First Nation communities that acknowledge and respect values, beliefs and unique circumstances being served. As such, culturally appropriate services encourage activities such as kinship care options where a child is placed with an extended family member so that cultural identity and traditions may be maintained.\n(see AANDC\u2019s Response to the 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, emphasis added)\n[425] Even with this guiding principle, if funding is restricted to provide such services, then the principle is rendered meaningless. A glaring example of this is the denial of funding for Band Representatives under the 1965 Agreement in Ontario. Another is the assumptions built into Directive 20-1 and the EPFA. If funding does not correspond to the actual child welfare needs of a specific First Nation community, then how is it expected to provide services that are culturally appropriate? With unrealistic funding, how are some First Nations communities expected to address the effects of Residential Schools? It will be difficult if not impossible to do, resulting in more kids ending up in care and perpetuating the cycle of control that outside forces have exerted over Aboriginal culture and identity.\n[426] Similar to the Residential Schools era, today, the fate and future of many First Nations children is still being determined by the government, whether it is through the application of restrictive and inadequate funding formulas or through bilateral agreements with the provinces. The purpose of having a First Nation community deliver child and family services, and to be involved through a Band Representative, is to ensure services are culturally appropriate and reflect the needs of the community. This in turn may help legitimize the child and family services in the eyes of the community, increasing their effectiveness, and ultimately help rebuild individuals, families and communities that have been heavily affected by the Residential Schools system and other historical trauma.\n[427] In this regard, it should be noted again that the federal government is in a fiduciary relationship with Aboriginal peoples and has undertaken to improve outcomes for First Nations children and families in the provision of child and family services. On this basis, more has to be done to ensure that the provision of child and family services on First Nations reserves is meeting the best interest of those communities and, in the particular context of this case, the best interest of First Nations children. This also corresponds to Canada\u2019s international commitments recognizing the special status of children and Indigenous peoples.\niii. Canada\u2019s international commitments to children and Indigenous peoples\n[428] As stated earlier, Amnesty International was granted \u201cInterested Party\u201d status to assist the Tribunal in understanding the relevance of Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations to the Complaint. Amnesty International argues that the interpretation and application of the CHRA, and in particular of section 5, must respect Canada\u2019s international obligations as enunciated in various international United Nations instruments, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n[429] Amnesty International also refers to the views of treaty bodies, such as the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in support of its argument that when a treatment discriminates both on the basis of First Nations identity and because of residency, it constitutes multiple violations of the prohibition of discrimination, which is a peremptory norm of international law. Specifically, Amnesty International points to these bodies\u2019 recommendations that special attention must be given to the prohibition of discrimination against children.\n[430] In AANDC\u2019s view, the international law concepts and arguments advanced by Amnesty International do not assist the Tribunal in interpreting and applying the CHRA to the facts of this Complaint. Rather, they see Amnesty International\u2019s arguments as a claim that the Government of Canada is in violation of its international obligations, which is beyond the purview of the Complaint.\n[431] In order to form part of Canadian law, international treaties need national legislative implementation, unless they codify norms of customary international law that are already found in Canadian domestic law. However, when a country becomes party to a treaty or a covenant, it clearly indicates its adherence to the contents of such a treaty or covenant and therefore makes a commitment to implement its principles in its national legislation. This public engagement is solemn and binding in international law. It is a declaration from the country that its national legislation will reflect its international commitments. Therefore, international law remains relevant in interpreting the scope and content of human rights in Canadian law, as was underlined by the Supreme Court on numerous occasions since Chief Justice Dickson\u2019s dissent in Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 SCR 313.\n[432] The basic principle, which is not limited to Charter interpretation, is that \u201cthe Charter should generally be presumed to provide protection at least as great as that afforded by similar provisions in international human rights documents which Canada has ratified\u201d (Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 SCR 1038 at p. 1056). That is so because Parliament and the provincial legislatures are presumed to respect the principles of international law (see Baker at para. 81).\n[433] This approach often leads the Supreme Court to look at decisions and recommendations of human right bodies to interpret the scope and content of domestic law provisions in the light of international law (see for example Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 SCR 892 at p. 920; B. (R.) v. Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, [1995] 1 SCR 315 at pp. 149-150; Divito v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 47 at paras 26-27; and, Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v. Saskatchewan, 2015 SCC 4 at paras 154-160).\n[434] In recent years, the Supreme Court has been willing to expand the relevance of international law and to give effect to Canada\u2019s role and actions in the development of norms of international law, particularly in the area of human rights (see United States v. Burns, 2001 SCC 7 at para. 81 [Burns]; and, Canada (Justice) v. Khadr, 2008 SCC 28 at paras. 2-3). In Burns, the Supreme Court found that Canada\u2019s advocacy for the abolition of the death penalty, and efforts to bring about change in extradition arrangements when a fugitive faces the death penalty, prevented it from extraditing someone to the United States facing the same sentence without obtaining assurance that it would not be carried out. The same reasoning applies to the case at hand as Canada has expressed its views internationally on the importance of human rights on numerous occasions.\n[435] Indeed, since the foundation of the United Nations (the UN), Canada has been actively involved in the promotion of human rights on the international scene. This began with the participation of the Canadian Director of the UN Secretariat\u2019s Division for Human Rights, Mr. John Humphrey, in writing the preliminary draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration), in 1947. Today, Canada still voices itself as a strong supporter of human rights at the international level.\n[436] Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations with respect to equality and non-discrimination stem from various legal instruments. Similarities can be seen in the wording of both domestic and international human rights instruments and in the scope and content of their provisions. The close relationship between Canadian and international human rights law can also be seen both in the periodic reports submitted by Canada to various international treaty monitoring bodies on the steps taken domestically to give effect to the obligations flowing from the treaties and in the monitoring bodies\u2019 recommendations to Canada.\n[437] Developments in human rights at the national level followed the Universal Declaration at the international level. Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly by resolution 217A at its 3rd session in Paris on 10 December 1948, article 2 of the Universal Declaration sets out the principle of equality and non-discrimination in the enjoyment of human rights. Article 7 proclaims equality before the law and equal protection of the law. As indicated above, these equality principles are now ingrained in section 15 of the Charter and in the purpose of the CHRA.\n[438] Initially, the Universal Declaration was intended as a guide for governments in their efforts to guarantee human rights domestically. It was also meant to enunciate human rights principles that would be further developed into a legally binding convention. This eventually led to the adoption of two covenants and two optional protocols that, along with the Universal Declaration, are considered to form the International Bill of Rights.\n[439] The first of those two covenants was the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 (the ICCPR), entered into force by Canada on August 19, 1976. At the same time, Canada recognized the jurisdiction of the UNHRC to hear individual complaints by ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 302. Articles 2 and 26 of the ICCPR guarantee equality and prohibit discrimination in terms that are similar to those of the Universal Declaration.\n[440] In General Comment 18, thirty-seventh session, 10 November 1989 at paragraph 7, the UNHRC stated that the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as used in the ICCPR should be understood to imply:\nany distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.\nThe UNHRC went on to state that the aim of the protection is substantive equality, and to achieve this aim States may be required to take specific measures (see at paras. 5, 8, and 12-13).\n[441] The second of the two covenants that stem directly from the Universal Declaration is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 993 U.N.T.S. 3 (the ICESCR), which Canada entered into force on August 19, 1976. Article 2(2) guarantees the exercise of the rights protected without discrimination. Article 10 provides that special measures of protection and assistance should be taken on behalf of all children and young persons without any discrimination for reasons of parentage or other conditions.\n[442] The ICESCR is considered to be of progressive application. However, in General Comment No. 20, 2 July 2009 (E\/C.12\/GC\/20), the CESCR stated that, given their importance, the principles of equality and non-discrimination are of immediate application, notwithstanding the provisions of article 2 of the ICESR (see paras. 5 and 7). The CESCR also affirmed that the aim of the ICESCR is to achieve substantive equality by \u201c\u2026paying sufficient attention to groups of individuals which suffer historical or persistent prejudice instead of merely comparing the formal treatment of individuals in similar situations\u201d (at paras. 8; see also paras. 9 and 10). It added that the exercise of covenant rights should not be conditional on a person\u2019s place of residence (see at para. 34).\n[443] In a report to the CESCR outlining key measures it adopted for the period of January 2005 to December 2009 to enhance its implementation of the ICESCR, Canada reported on the FNCFS Program and declared that \u201c[t]he anticipated result is a more secure and stable family environment and improved outcomes for Indian children ordinarily resident on reserve\u201d (see Canada\u2019s Sixth Report on the United Nations\u2019 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, 2013) at para. 103). Canada also reported that it had begun transitioning the FNCFS Program to a more prevention based model, the EPFA, \u201c\u2026on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis with ready and willing First Nations and provincial\/territorial partners [\u2026] with the goal to have all jurisdictions on board by 2013\u201d (at paras. 105-106). While the Government of Canada made this undertaking, the evidence is clear that this goal was not met.\n[444] In addition to the covenants that protect human rights in general, Canada is a party to legal instruments that focus on specific issues or aim to protect specific groups of persons. Canada is a party to the International Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, 660 U.N.T.S. 195 (the ICERD), ratified in 1970. The ICERD clarifies the prohibition of discrimination found in the Universal Declaration, to which it refers to in its preamble. Articles 1 and 2 define racial discrimination and direct States to take all necessary measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them. The purpose is to guarantee them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including special measures whenever warranted. Article 5 further highlights rights whose enjoyment must be free of discrimination, including the right to social services, which includes public health, medical care and social security.\n[445] The monitoring body of the ICERD, the CERD, has discussed the meaning and scope of special measures in the ICERD. It has expressed a similar understanding of substantive equality as Canadian courts (see CERD, General Recommendation No. 32, September 24, 2009 (CERD\/C\/GC\/32) at para. 8). In addition, it recognized that \u201cspecial measures\u201d that may be called for in order to achieve effective equality \u201c\u2026include the full span of legislative, executive, administrative, budgetary and regulatory instruments, at every level in the State apparatus\u2026\u201d (at para. 13).\n[446] In 2011, Canada reported to the CERD on the measures taken domestically to implement the ICERD. The CERD made several recommendations, including: \u201c[d]iscontinuing the removal of Aboriginal children from their families and providing family and child care services on reserves with sufficient funding\u201d [see Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 9 of the convention, Concluding observations of the CERD, 9 March 2012 (CERD\/C\/CAN\/CO\/19-20) at para. 19(f)].\n[447] Although AANDC argues that the federal government is merely funding child welfare services on-reserve as a matter of social policy, budgetary measures in and of themselves are an important component of the steps to be taken in order to achieve substantive equality for First Nations children. The recommendation of the CERD, read with the views it expressed in General Recommendation No. 32, indicate that the CERD sees insufficient funding of child care services on reserve as inhibiting substantive equality for First Nations in the provision of child and family services.\n[448] Another important international instrument aiming at the protection of a specific group of persons that is relevant to the present case is the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3 (the CRC), entered into force by Canada on January 12, 1992. Children have the same human rights as adults. However, they are more vulnerable and in need of protection that addresses their special needs. Consequently, the CRC focuses on giving them the special care, assistance and legal protection that they need (see in particular articles 2, 3, 5, 7.1, 8.1, 9, 9.1, 18.1, 20, 25 and 30). Furthermore, when it ratified the CRC, Canada made a Statement of Understanding expressing its view that, in assessing what measures are appropriate to implementing the rights recognized in the CRC, the rights of Aboriginal children to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion and to use their own language must not be denied (Convention on the Rights of the Child, Declarations and Reservations, Canada, online: United Nations <http:\/\/www.treaties.un.org>).\n[449] The CRC\u2019s monitoring body, the CRC Committee, stressed the importance of culturally appropriate social services for indigenous children (see General Comment No. 11, February 12, 2009 (CRC\/C\/GC\/11) at para. 25). With respect to childcare and support services, Canada reported that \u201c[t]he Government of Canada plays a supporting role by providing a range of child and family benefits and transferring funds to other governments in Canada based on shared goals and objectives\u201d (Canada\u2019s Third and Fourth Reports on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 20 November 2009 at para. 49). Canada also reported, as it did to the CESCR, that it is incrementally shifting its child welfare programs for Aboriginal children to a prevention-focused approach and that it expected that all agencies would be using the prevention-focused approach by 2013 (see at para. 98).\n[450] In response to Canada, the CRC Committee expressed deep concern \u201c\u2026at the high number of children in alternative care and at the frequent removal of children from their families as a first resort in cases of neglect or financial hardship or disability\u201d (Concluding observations on the combined third and fourth periodic report of Canada, adopted by the Committee at its sixty-first session (17 September \u2013 5 October 2012), 6 December 2012 (CRC\/C\/CAN\/CO\/3-4) at para. 55). Among other things, the CRC Committee recommended that Canada intensify cooperation with communities and community leaders to find suitable alternative care solutions for children in these communities [see at para. 56(f)]. It further recommended that Canada \u201c[e]nsure that funding and other support, including welfare services, provided to Aboriginal, African-Canadian, and other minority children, including welfare services, is comparable in quality and accessibility to services provided to other children in the State party and is adequate to meet their needs\u201d [see at para. 68(c)].\n[451] Again, the recommendations of the CRC Committee reinforce the need for adequate funding, linked to the needs of First Nations children and families, in order to achieve substantive equality in the provision of child and family services on-reserve.\n[452] Finally, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, GA Res. 61\/295, UN GAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No 49 Vol III, UN Doc A\/61\/49 (2007) (the UNDRIP), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on September 13, 2007, was endorsed by Canada on November 12, 2010. Article 2 provides that Indigenous peoples and individuals are free and equal to all other peoples and individuals and have the right to be free from any kind of discrimination, in the exercise of their rights, in particular rights based on their indigenous origin or identity. Although this international instrument is, at the time being, a declaration and not a treaty or a covenant, and is not legally binding except to the extent that some of its provisions reflect customary international law, when Canada endorsed it, it reaffirmed its commitment to \u201c\u2026improve the well-being of Aboriginal Canadians\u201d(Canada's Statement of Support on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, November 12, 2010, online: Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada <http:\/\/www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca>).\n[453] The international instruments and treaty monitoring bodies referred to above view equality to be substantive and not merely formal. Consequently, they consider that specific measures, including of a budgetary nature, are often required in order to achieve substantive equality. These international legal instruments also reinforce the need for due attention to be paid to the unique situation and needs of children and First Nations people, especially the combination of those two vulnerable groups: First Nations children.\n[454] The concerns expressed by international monitoring bodies mirror many of the issues raised in this Complaint. The declarations made by Canada in its periodic reports to the various monitoring bodies clearly show that the federal government is aware of the steps to be taken domestically to address these issues. Canada\u2019s statements and commitments, whether expressed on the international scene or at the national level, should not be allowed to remain empty rhetoric.\n[455] Substantive equality and Canada\u2019s international obligations require that First Nations children on-reserve be provided child and family services of comparable quality and accessibility as those provided to all Canadians off-reserve, including that they be sufficiently funded to meet the real needs of First Nations children and families and do not perpetuate historical disadvantage.\nVI. Complaint substantiated\n[456] In light of the above, the Panel finds the Complainants have presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under section 5 of the CHRA. Specifically, they prima facie established that First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are denied [s. 5(a)] equal child and family services and\/or differentiated adversely [s. 5(b)] in the provision of child and family services.\n[457] Through the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements, AANDC provides a service intended to \u201censure\u201d, \u201carrange\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d and\/or \u201cmake available\u201d child and family services to First Nations on reserve. With specific regard to the FNCFS Program, the objective is to ensure culturally appropriate child and family services to First Nations children and families on reserve and in the Yukon that are intended to be in accordance with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards and provided in a reasonably comparable manner to those provided off reserve in similar circumstances. However, the evidence in this case demonstrates that AANDC does more than just ensure the provision of child and family services to First Nations, it controls the provision of those services through its funding mechanisms to the point where it negatively impacts children and families on reserve.\n[458] AANDC\u2019s design, management and control of the FNCFS Program, along with its corresponding funding formulas and the other related provincial\/territorial agreements have resulted in denials of services and created various adverse impacts for many First Nations children and families living on reserves. Non-exhaustively, the main adverse impacts found by the Panel are:\nThe design and application of the Directive 20-1 funding formula, which provides funding based on flawed assumptions about children in care and population thresholds that do not accurately reflect the service needs of many on-reserve communities. This results in inadequate fixed funding for operation (capital costs, multiple offices, cost of living adjustment, staff salaries and benefits, training, legal, remoteness and travel) and prevention costs (primary, secondary and tertiary services to maintain children safely in their family homes), hindering the ability of FNCFS Agencies to provide provincially\/territorially mandated child welfare services, let alone culturally appropriate services to First Nations children and families and, providing an incentive to bring children into care because eligible maintenance expenditures are reimbursable at cost.\nThe current structure and implementation of the EPFA funding formula, which perpetuates the incentives to remove children from their homes and incorporates the flawed assumptions of Directive 20-1 in determining funding for operations and prevention, and perpetuating the adverse impacts of Directive 20-1 in many on-reserve communities.\nThe failure to adjust Directive 20-1 funding levels, since 1995; along with funding levels under the EPFA, since its implementation, to account for inflation\/cost of living;\nThe application of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario that has not been updated to ensure on-reserve communities can comply fully with Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act.\nThe failure to coordinate the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements with other federal departments and government programs and services for First Nations on reserve, resulting in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children and families.\nThe narrow definition and inadequate implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle, resulting in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children.\n[459] The FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements only apply to First Nations people living on-reserve and in the Yukon. It is only because of their race and\/or national or ethnic origin that they suffer the adverse impacts outlined above in the provision of child and family services. Furthermore, these adverse impacts perpetuate the historical disadvantage and trauma suffered by Aboriginal people, in particular as a result of the Residential Schools system.\n[460] AANDC\u2019s evidence and arguments challenging the Complainants\u2019 allegations of discrimination have been addressed throughout this decision. Overall, the Panel finds AANDC\u2019s position unreasonable, unconvincing and not supported by the preponderance of evidence in this case. Otherwise, as mentioned earlier, AANDC did not raise a statutory exception under sections 15 or 16 of the CHRA.\n[461] Despite being aware of the adverse impacts resulting from the FNCFS Program for many years, AANDC has not significantly modified the program since its inception in 1990. Nor have the schedules of the 1965 Agreement in Ontario been updated since 1998. Notwithstanding numerous reports and recommendations to address the adverse impacts outlined above, including its own internal analysis and evaluations, AANDC has sparingly implemented the findings of those reports. While efforts have been made to improve the FNCFS Program, including through the EPFA and other additional funding, those improvements still fall short of addressing the service gaps, denials and adverse impacts outlined above and, ultimately, fail to meet the goal of providing culturally appropriate child and family services to First Nations children and families living on-reserve that are reasonably comparable to those provided off-reserve.\n[462] This concept of reasonable comparability is one of the issues at the heart of the problem. AANDC has difficulty defining what it means and putting it into practice, mainly because its funding authorities and interpretation thereof are not in line with provincial\/territorial legislation and standards. Despite not being experts in the area of child welfare and knowing that funding according to its authorities is often insufficient to meet provincial\/territorial legislation and standards, AANDC insists that FNCFS Agencies somehow abide by those standards and provide reasonably comparable child and family services. Instead of assessing the needs of First Nations children and families and using provincial legislation and standards as a reference to design an adequate program to address those needs, AANDC adopts an ad hoc approach to addressing needed changes to its program.\n[463] This is exemplified by the implementation of the EPFA. AANDC makes improvements to its program and funding methodology, however, in doing so, also incorporates a cost-model it knows is flawed. AANDC tries to obtain comparable variables from the provinces to fit them into this cost-model, however, they are unable to obtain all the relevant variables given the provinces often do not calculate things in the same fashion or use a funding formula. By analogy, it is like adding support pillars to a house that has a weak foundation in an attempt to straighten and support the house. At some point, the foundation needs to be fixed or, ultimately, the house will fall down. Similarly, a REFORM of the FNCFS Program is needed in order to build a solid foundation for the program to address the real needs of First Nations children and families living on reserve.\n[464] Not being experts in child welfare, AANDC\u2019s authorities are concerned with comparable funding levels; whereas provincial\/territorial child and family services legislation and standards are concerned with ensuring service levels that are in line with sound social work practice and that meet the best interest of children. It is difficult, if not impossible, to ensure reasonably comparable child and family services where there is this dichotomy between comparable funding and comparable services. Namely, this methodology does not account for the higher service needs of many First Nations children and families living on reserve, along with the higher costs to deliver those services in many situations, and it highlights the inherent problem with the assumptions and population levels built into the FNCFS Program.\n[465] AANDC\u2019s reasonable comparability standard does not ensure substantive equality in the provision of child and family services for First Nations people living on reserve. In this regard, it is worth repeating the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Withler, at paragraph 59, that \u201cfinding a mirror group may be impossible, as the essence of an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s equality claim may be that, in light of their distinct needs and circumstances, no one is like them for the purposes of comparison\u201d. This statement fits the context of this complaint quite appropriately. That is, human rights principles, both domestically and internationally, require AANDC to consider the distinct needs and circumstances of First Nations children and families living on-reserve - including their cultural, historical and geographical needs and circumstances \u2013 in order to ensure equality in the provision of child and family services to them. A strategy premised on comparable funding levels, based on the application of standard funding formulas, is not sufficient to ensure substantive equality in the provision of child and family services to First Nations children and families living on-reserve.\n[466] As a result, and having weighed all the evidence and argument in this case on a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the Complaint substantiated.\n[467] The Panel acknowledges the suffering of those First Nations children and families who are or have been denied an equitable opportunity to remain together or to be reunited in a timely manner. We also recognize those First Nations children and families who are or have been adversely impacted by the Government of Canada\u2019s past and current child welfare practices on reserves.\nVII. Order\n[468] As the Complaint has been substantiated, the Panel may make an order against AANDC pursuant to section 53(2) of the CHRA. The aim in making an order under section 53(2) is not to punish AANDC, but to eliminate discrimination (see Robichaud at para. 13). To accomplish this, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\n[469] It is also important to reiterate that the CHRA gives rise to rights of vital importance. Those rights must be given full recognition and effect through the Act. In crafting remedies under the CHRA, the Tribunal\u2019s powers under section 53(2) must be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure the objects of the Act are obtained. Applying a purposive approach, remedies under the CHRA should be effective in promoting the right being protected and meaningful in vindicating the rights and freedoms of the victim of discrimination (see CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 at p. 1134; and, Doucet-Boudreau at paras. 25 and 55).\n[470] The Complainants, Commission and Interested Parties request a variety of remedies to address the findings in this Complaint, including declaratory orders; orders to cease the discriminatory practice and take measures to redress or prevent it from reoccurring; and, compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA.\n[471] Furthermore, unrelated to the remedies requested under section 53(2), the Panel is also seized of a previous motion from the Complainants for costs related to the allegation that AANDC abused the Tribunal\u2019s process through its late disclosure of documents.\nA. Findings of discrimination\n[472] The Caring Society requests several declarations be made by the Tribunal in order to clarify which aspects of the FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements are discriminatory. According to the Caring Society, this Tribunal routinely provides declaratory relief in the form of findings of discrimination.\n[473] Indeed, throughout this decision, and generally at paragraph 458 above, the Panel has outlined the main adverse impacts it has found in relation to the FNCFS Program and other related provincial\/territorial agreements. As race and\/or national or ethnic origin is a factor in those adverse impacts, the Panel concluded First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are discriminated against in the provision of child and family services by AANDC. The Panel believes these findings address the Caring Society\u2019s request for declaratory relief.\nB. Cease the discriminatory practice and take measures to redress and prevent it\n[474] Section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA allows the Tribunal to order that the person found to be engaging in the discriminatory practice \u201ccease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future\u201d. Furthermore, section 53(2)(b) allows the Tribunal to order that the person \u201c\u2026make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice\u201d.\n[475] Pursuant to these sections of the CHRA, the Complainants and Commission request immediate relief for First Nations children. In their view, this can be accomplished by ordering AANDC to remove the most discriminatory aspects of the funding schemes it uses to fund FNCFS Agencies under the FNCFS Program and child and family services in Ontario under the 1965 Agreement; and, requiring AANDC to properly implement Jordan\u2019s Principle. Moving forward in the long term, the Complainants and Commission request other orders that AANDC reform the FNCFS Program and the 1965 Agreement to ensure equitable levels of service, including funding thereof, for First Nations child and family services on-reserve.\n[476] The Caring Society has provided a detailed methodology of how this reform can be achieved. It proposes a three-step process to redesign the FNCFS Program: (1) reconvene the National Advisory Committee to identify discriminatory elements in the provision of funding to FNCFS Agencies and make recommendations thereon; (2) fund tri-partite regional tables to negotiate the implementation of equitable and culturally based funding mechanisms and policies for each region; and, (3) develop an independent expert structure with the authority and mandate to ensure AANDC maintains non-discriminatory and culturally appropriate First Nations child and family services.\n[477] Relatedly, the Caring Society also requests the public posting of information regarding the FNCFS Program, Jordan\u2019s Principle and children in care to educate FNCFS Agencies and the public about AANDC\u2019s child welfare policies, practices and directives and to help prevent future discrimination. Furthermore, it asks that AANDC staff be trained on First Nations culture, historic disadvantage, human rights and social work.\n[478] The AFN requests similar reform, including commissioning a study to determine the most effective means of providing care for First Nations children and families and greater performance measurements and evaluations of AANDC employees related to the provision of First Nations child and family services. Similarly, in Ontario, the COO requests that an independent study of funding and service levels for First Nations child welfare in Ontario based on the 1965 Agreement be conducted.\n[479] Consistent with Canada\u2019s international obligations, Amnesty International stresses the need for a timely and effective remedy to achieve substantive equality for First Nations children and families on reserve, including increased funding, systemic structural changes to the way AANDC provides funding and a comprehensive and systematic monitoring mechanism for assuring non-repetition of breaches of the rights of First Nations children.\n[480] AANDC submits that, while the Tribunal may order amendments to policy and provide guidance on the shape of amendments, it cannot prescribe the specific policy that must be adopted. According to AANDC, this is particularly appropriate in this case where the policy at issue is a complex scheme that takes into account competing priorities and must fit within broader governmental policy approaches. Such decisions are entitled to some considerable degree of deference and margin of reasonableness. Furthermore, AANDC argues the proposed remedy would intrude into the executive branch of government\u2019s role to establish public policy and direct the spending of public funds in accordance with fiscal priorities. AANDC is also concerned that some of the proposed reform measures are over-broad and beyond the scope of the Complaint. As such, it views aspects of the methodology proposed by the Complainants to be beyond the power of the Tribunal or any other court to order.\n[481] The Panel is generally supportive of the requests for immediate relief and the methodologies for reforming the provision of child and family services to First Nations living on reserve, but also recognizes the need for balance espoused by AANDC. AANDC is ordered to cease its discriminatory practices and reform the FNCFS Program and 1965 Agreement to reflect the findings in this decision. AANDC is also ordered to cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan's principle.\n[482] More than just funding, there is a need to refocus the policy of the program to respect human rights principles and sound social work practice. In the best interest of the child, all First Nations children and families living on-reserve should have an opportunity \u201c\u2026equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society\u201d (CHRA at s. 2).\n[483] That said, given the complexity and far-reaching effects of the relief sought, the Panel wants to ensure that any additional orders it makes are appropriate and fair, both in the short and long-term. Throughout these proceedings, the Panel reserved the right to ask clarification questions of the parties while it reviewed the evidence. While a discriminatory practice has occurred and is ongoing, the Panel is left with outstanding questions about how best to remedy that discrimination. The Panel requires further clarification from the parties on the actual relief sought, including how the requested immediate and long-term reforms can best be implemented on a practical, meaningful and effective basis.\n[484] Within three weeks of the date of this decision, the Panel will contact the parties to determine a process for having its outstanding questions on remedy answered on an expeditious basis.\nC. Compensation\n[485] Under section 53(2)(e), the Tribunal can order compensation to the victim of discrimination for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. In addition, section 53(3) provides for the Tribunal to order compensation to the victim if the discriminatory practice was engaged in wilfully or recklessly. Awards of compensation under each of those sections cannot exceed $20,000.\n[486] The Caring Society asks the Panel to award compensation under section 53(3) for AANDC\u2019s wilful and reckless discriminatory conduct with respect to each First Nations child taken into care since February 2006 to the date of the award. In the Caring Society\u2019s view, as early as the 2000 findings of the NPR, AANDC voluntarily and egregiously omitted to rectify discrimination against First Nations children. It also notes that the federal government benefited for many years from the money it failed to devote to the provision of equal child and family services for First Nations children. As a result, it believes the maximum amount of $20,000 should be awarded per child. The Caring Society requests the compensation be placed in an independent trust to fund healing activities for the benefit of First Nations children who have suffered discrimination in the provision of child and family services.\n[487] The AFN also requests compensation. It asks for an order that it, AANDC, the Caring Society and the Commission form an expert panel to establish appropriate individual compensation for children, parents and siblings impacted by the child welfare practices on reserve between 2006 and the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order.\n[488] Amnesty International submits any compensation should address both physical and psychological damages, including the emotional harm and inherent indignity suffered as a result of the breach.\n[489] AANDC submits there is insufficient evidence before the Tribunal to award the requested compensation. It argues the Caring Society\u2019s request is fundamentally flawed as it depends on the unproven premise that all these children were removed from their homes because of AANDC\u2019s funding practices. According to AANDC, the Caring Society\u2019s assertions overlook the complex nature of factors that lead to a child being removed from his or her home and, given the absence of individual evidence thereon, it is impossible for the Tribunal to assess compensation on an individual basis. Furthermore, AANDC submits the Complainants\u2019 authority to receive and distribute funds on behalf of \u201cvictims\u201d has not been established.\n[490] Similar to its comments above, the Panel has outstanding questions regarding the Complainants\u2019 request for compensation under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA. Again, within three weeks of the date of this decision, the Panel will contact the parties to determine a process for having its outstanding questions on remedy answered.\nD. Costs for obstruction of process\n[491] As part of a motion for disclosure decided in ruling 2013 CHRT 16, the Complainants requested costs from AANDC with respect to its alleged obstruction of the Tribunal\u2019s process. At that time, the Panel took the costs request under reserve and indicated the issue would be the subject of a subsequent ruling. The Complainants have reiterated their request for costs as part of their closing submissions on this Complaint. In response, AANDC reaffirmed its assertion that the Tribunal does not have the authority to award such costs.\n[492] The Panel continues to reserve its ruling on the Complainants\u2019 request for costs in relation to the motion for disclosure decided in ruling 2013 CHRT 16. A ruling on the issue will be provided in due course.\nE. Retention of jurisdiction\n[493] The Complainants, Commission and Interested Parties request the Panel retain jurisdiction over this matter until any orders are fully implemented.\n[494] As indicated above, the Panel has outstanding questions on the remedies being sought by the Complainants and Commission. A determination on those remedies is still to be made. As such, the Panel will maintain jurisdiction over this matter pending the determination of those outstanding remedies. Any further retention of jurisdiction will be re-evaluated when those determinations are made.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P.

Venue for the hearing\n[1] Pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d), Ms. Sandra Temple claims Horizon International Distributors (\u201cHorizon\u201d) treated her adversely and, ultimately, terminated her employment because of factors related to her sex and disability.\n[2] The following ruling determines the venue for the hearing of Ms. Temple\u2019s complaint. Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, I have determined that the hearing will be held in Calgary, for the witnesses being called by Ms. Temple, and in Winnipeg for the witnesses being called by Horizon.\nII. Positions of the parties\n[3] Horizon requests that the hearing of Ms. Temple\u2019s complaint take place in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It submits this is the most practical and cost-effective venue in light of the location of the parties and the anticipated witnesses. Among other considerations, Horizon\u2019s operations and all eight of its anticipated witnesses are located in Winnipeg. Furthermore, seven of Horizon\u2019s eight anticipated witnesses work for the company and, if they are required to travel outside of Winnipeg for the hearing, this will not only be at a significant cost to Horizon but will also disrupt its operations. Those costs are not recoverable by Horizon. As a result, Horizon submits it is unjust and inequitable for the hearing to take place anywhere other than Winnipeg.\n[4] Ms. Temple requests that the hearing be held in Calgary, Alberta. For financial and family related reasons, this would be the least disruptive venue for her. Ms. Temple and her mother, for whom she cares, are located near Calgary. Along with Ms. Temple, her husband has also been identified as a witness and is also located near Calgary. Ms. Temple\u2019s other anticipated witness is located in Chilliwack, British Columbia. In the alternative, should I rule that the hearing be held in Winnipeg, Ms. Temple requests that Horizon pay her reasonable travel, accommodation and general out-of-pocket expenses for the duration of the hearing.\n[5] The Commission notes that there is an imbalance of power between the Complainant and Respondent. To hold the hearing in Winnipeg would be far from Ms. Temple\u2019s home base and could be intimidating for a self-represented litigant. Should the hearing be held in Winnipeg, the Commission agrees with Ms. Temple\u2019s request that Horizon pay the reasonable costs for her to attend.\nIII. November 7, 2016 case management conference call\n[6] On a case management conference call held on November 7, 2016, the parties and I discussed Horizon\u2019s venue motion and the parties\u2019 respective written submissions.\n[7] In reply to Ms. Temple\u2019s submissions, Horizon emphasized that the complaint has no ties to Calgary. In addition, based on his will-say statement, Horizon anticipates objecting to the testimony of Ms. Temple\u2019s husband as corroborating and\/or hearsay evidence. Therefore, it argues little weight should be given to where Mr. Temple is located in determining the venue for the hearing.\n[8] With respect to Ms. Temple\u2019s request for costs, I indicated that the Tribunal does not have the authority to make such an order in the circumstances.\n[9] I also proposed a third venue option to the parties for their consideration: a dual-venue hearing. That is, when Ms. Temple is leading her case, the hearing would be held in Calgary; and, when Horizon is leading its case, the hearing would be held in Winnipeg. In either location, the parties could utilize video-conferencing, if they so choose, to attend the hearing so as to avoid travel costs. Any and all arrangements for the hearing, including video-conferencing, would be made by the Tribunal.\n[10] Ms. Temple and the Commission were agreeable to this option. However, following further consideration after the conference call, Horizon indicated it was not prepared to consent to the dual-venue hearing option. Counsel and a representative from Horizon would prefer to be present when Ms. Temple provides her evidence in order to properly understand and respond to it. According to Horizon, the details presented in Ms. Temple\u2019s Statement of Particulars are difficult to follow and it would be a significant impairment for it not to be physically present when she is presenting her evidence. Although the cost burden would be lessened by the dual-venue option, it would still require the company to expend some travel and accommodation costs and, therefore, Horizon also submits that this would not be a cost-effective option for them.\nIV. Analysis\n[11] Typically, the Tribunal holds hearings in the place where the alleged discrimination occurred or in the place most closely linked to the alleged discriminatory conduct. However, this is not a hard and fast rule and the Tribunal strives to accommodate the parties where it is appropriate to do so (see Baumbach v. Deer Lake Education Authority, 2004 CHRT 13 at para. 6). Ultimately, I must ensure the venue for the hearing meets the standards of the CHRA that require a fair, informal, expeditious and open hearing process, where each party is given a full and ample opportunity to appear, present evidence and make representations (see ss. 48.9(1), 50(1) and 52(1) of the CHRA).\n[12] The alleged discrimination did not occur directly in either Winnipeg or Calgary, nor is either location closely linked to the alleged discriminatory conduct. That is because Horizon is a trucking company and Ms. Temple was engaged by Horizon as a truck owner\/operator driving loads anywhere from Winnipeg to Vancouver. Most, if not all, of the discrimination alleged by Ms. Temple occurred while she was on the road, away from home and Horizon\u2019s offices.\n[13] That said, I appreciate the concerns raised by each of the parties. In consideration of those concerns, I believe a dual-venue hearing in both Winnipeg and Calgary best accommodates the needs of Ms. Temple and Horizon.\n[14] A dual-venue hearing in this case reduces travel costs for each of the parties. Ms. Temple will not have to travel to Winnipeg and only counsel for Horizon and a representative of the company will travel to Calgary if they choose not to utilize the option of participating by video-conference. Horizon\u2019s witnesses will not need to travel to Calgary, which saves the company those costs and addresses its concerns with respect to the disruption of its operations.\n[15] The dual-venue hearing also ensures both Ms. Temple and Horizon have a full and ample opportunity to present their respective cases in their preferred location. Testifying in Calgary, and participating in the Winnipeg portion of the hearing via videoconference, facilitates Ms. Temple\u2019s ability to attend the hearing and allows her to be in an environment where she feels comfortable and is still able to care for her mother.\n[16] For Horizon, although the option of utilizing videoconferencing is there, its preference to be physically present for Ms. Temple\u2019s testimony is fully accommodated with the dual-venue hearing. Equally, its preference to lead its case in Winnipeg is also accommodated.\nV. Ruling\n[17] For the above reasons, the hearing of this matter will be held in Calgary, for the witnesses being called by Ms. Temple, and in Winnipeg for the witnesses being called by Horizon.\n[18] I further propose to the parties that other methods of simplifying and expediting the hearing can be utilized to make this dual-venue hearing even more effective for both parties. For example, I encourage the parties to explore the possibility of preparing an agreed statement of facts and to consider the use of affidavits for the examination in chief of their witnesses.\n[19] The above methods of simplifying and expediting the hearing, along with the other logistical details of the hearing (including dates, facilities, video-conferencing requirements, telephone line requirements, the submission of books of documents, and the presentation of closing arguments) will be discussed with the parties at a future case management conference call.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 22, 2016\n",

Introduction\n[1] The Respondent in this case, Canada Post Corporation, brings a motion for an order dismissing a portion of the complaint, on the ground that it is not compliant with s. 41(1)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d). This provision allows the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cCHRC\u201d) to refuse to deal with complaints that are filed over one year after the occurrence of the acts or omissions alleged therein. I have decided to dismiss the motion, for the reasons below.\nII. Background\n[2] In a complaint filed November 23, 2009, the Complainant alleged adverse differentiation in the course of employment, within the meaning of s. 7(b) of the CHRA, on the ground of disability. The allegations span a period commencing on April 22, 2008 and continuing to the date of filing of the complaint. The alleged acts generally relate to the Complainant\u2019s medical restrictions and what he views as the Respondent\u2019s failure to assign him duties that respected those restrictions, as well as the management of his return to work following a disability-related absence.\n[3] It appears that the Commission did not immediately deal with the complaint, as it was of the opinion that the Complainant ought to exhaust grievance procedures that were otherwise reasonably available to him. This procedure is contemplated in s. 41(1)(a) of the CHRA.\n[4] The Commission ultimately decided to deal with the complaint and referred it for investigation in 2013. Upon receipt of the Investigator\u2019s Report, the Acting Chief Commissioner, on February 25, 2015, requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into the complaint, as it was satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry was warranted.\nIII. Legal Framework\n[5] Section 41(1)(e) of the CHRA reads as follows:\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n[\u2026]\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n41 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\n[\u2026]\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[6] In Canada (C.H.R.C.) v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (re Vermette) (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/139 (F.C.T.D.) (\u201cVermette\u201d), the Federal Court dismissed a judicial review application, on the ground that an adequate alternative remedy existed. In obiter (see paras. 22-23), the Court held that s. 41(e), as it was then called, created a substantive right that could be invoked before the Tribunal:\n[28] Why should that be the Court's interpretation of para. 41(e)? It is because Parliament enacted the one-year datum as a substantive right of, or benefit to, those against whom complaints are made, but the Commission does not deal with complaints by dealing with anyone's substantive rights. Tribunals, however, do determine substantive rights in according full hearings pursuant to powers provided in s. 50, and in concluding whether complaints be substantiated against respondents, or not pursuant to s. 53.\n[29] Full, fair hearings are those in which the persons against whom complaints are made are accorded each the opportunity to make a full answer and defence to the complainant's case. Clearly, being prevented from benefiting from the one-year limitation can be raised in a full answer and defence. This is the tribunals' province, because they, in the normal course of the litigation, hear (or read) all, inevitably more, of the evidence and more of the circumstances than does the Commission in its preliminary role\u2026\n[7] The Court in Vermette went on to hold that while the Commission might make a preliminary and procedural decision under s. 41(e), this was not \"etched in everlasting stone\" but was subject to being modified according to a Tribunal's appreciation of what was appropriate, at the Tribunal's hearing, in order to determine the respondent's substantive right to the benefit of the limitation period (see para. 33).\n[8] The Court was careful to point out that, while it might seem that the Tribunal was reviewing the Commission\u2019s decision under s. 41(e), in essence the Tribunal was determining the respondent\u2019s substantive rights in the circumstances of the \u201clevying\u201d of the complaint (see para. 34).\n[9] The Vermette judgment was later discussed in the case of I.L.W.U. (Marine Section), Local 400 v. Oster [2002] 2 FCR 430 (\u201cOster\u201d). In Oster, the Court observed that s. 41(1)(e) effectively confers a discretion on the Commission to extend the one-year time limitation for the filing of a complaint, which is incompatible with the notion that s. 41 created a legal right not to be investigated in specific circumstances. The Oster Court noted that the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under s. 41(1)(e) was judicially reviewable by the Federal Court, and that the \u201csubstantive rights\u201d approach in Vermette was incongruous with the existence of this judicial review jurisdiction:\n[29]\u2026the position adopted by Mr. Justice Muldoon in Vermette [Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (re Vermette) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11865 (FC), 120 F.T.R. 81 (F.C.T.D.)] and adopted by the Tribunal in this matter could lead to what I regard as a rather anomalous result: this Court could judicially review a time extension by the Commission and affirm it and yet the same decision of the Commission would be open to substantive review by the Tribunal in the event that the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal. In the absence of specific statutory language demonstrating that Parliament intended such a result, I conclude that it did not so intend.\n[30] In the result, I conclude that the Tribunal erred against a standard of correctness, in assuming jurisdiction with respect to the Union's preliminary objections. The Union, having decided not to seek judicial review before this Court of the Commission's discretionary decision to extend the time limit under paragraph 41(1)(e) of the Act, was simply precluded from adopting the alternative recourse that it chose, that being to raise precisely the same issues that it could have raised on judicial review, before the Tribunal.\n[10] In addition to the Oster case, where the Tribunal\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction was overruled, the Tribunal has been invited to interpret the scope of s. 41 of the CHRA on a number of other occasions.\n[11] For example, in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, 1997 CanLII 1251 (CHRT), the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was questioned on the ground that certain necessary preliminary steps had not been taken by the Commission. In particular, it was argued that the Commission had not specifically addressed the issue of whether the complainant should be required to exhaust an internal appeal mechanism, and that this step was necessary under s. 41(a) of the CHRA, as it then was then called. The Tribunal solicited submissions from the parties \u201c\u2026as to the nature and extent of the Tribunal's power, if any, to review the actions or inactions of the Commission while the complaint was before it.\u201d [emphasis added]\n[12] The Tribunal in Wall ruled that \u201c\u2026it did not have the power to examine the conduct of the Commission or to review decisions that the Commission had taken, or indeed the fact that decisions may not have been taken.\u201d [emphasis added] It went on to hold that its jurisdiction was a limited one, based upon the authority conferred upon it by the CHRA, and in particular, by s. 50 (1), which mandated it to inquire into the complaint.\n[13] In Dumont v. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2001 CanLII 38314 (CHRT), the complaint had been filed in 1998 in relation to matters occurring in 1996. The Tribunal observed that:\n[2] \u2026The Canadian Human Rights Commission evidently exercised the discretion conferred on it by Section 41 (1) (e) of the Act, and decided to deal with Mr. Dumont's complaint, notwithstanding that the complaint appears to relate to matters occurring more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint. [emphasis added]\n[14] It later held as follows:\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal does not have the power to review the way in which the Canadian Human Rights Commission chooses to exercise its discretion pursuant to Section 41 (1) (e) of the Act. This is a matter within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court. The fact that the Commission made its decision to deal with Mr. Dumont's complaint, apparently without the benefit of submissions from TJG, may well have been of some significance. It is noteworthy, however, that there is no indication that TJG has attempted to judicially review the Commission's decision to deal with Mr. Dumont's complaint\u2026 [footnotes omitted; emphasis added]\n[15] The Commission and Respondent in the present case have both made reference to the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Leonardis v. Canada Post Corporation, 2002 CanLII 45934 (CHRT), where the respondents before the Tribunal sought the dismissal of the case pursuant to s. 41(1)(e) due to the complaints having been filed over a year after the last alleged incident. In particular, the Leonardis respondents argued that this provision had the effect of conferring on them the benefit of a one-year limitation period, which the Tribunal characterized as an assertion of a \u201csubstantive right.\u201d The Tribunal in Leonardis examined both the Vermette and Oster judgments discussed above, after which it concluded that \u201c\u2026[s]ubsection 41(1) cannot be interpreted as providing additional substantive rights to respondents that can be decided upon by this Tribunal.\u201d (para. 7)\n[16] In Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation, 2002 CanLII 61852 (CHRT), aff\u2019d on other grounds in 2004 FC 81, the Tribunal accepted the argument put forward by the Commission that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with submissions from the respondent that were based on the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under s. 41 (see paras. 5-6).\n[17] In Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 CHRT 31 (\u201cTelus\u201d), the Tribunal, in dismissing a s. 41(1)(e) objection, observed that when the person against whom a complaint is made believes that the complaint was filed after the time limit, the person may raise this point before the Commission. However there was nothing to indicate in the record that the respondent argued its claims before the Commission as to the lateness of the complaint (see paras. 49-50).\n[18] In Warman v. Northern Alliance, 2009 CHRT 10, the Tribunal observed that: \u201c\u2026a decision by the Commission to request an inquiry by the Tribunal where the alleged conduct occurred more than a year before the complaint was filed is contemplated by ss. 41 (1) (e) and 44 (3) of the Act\u2026 [I]n these circumstances, the Tribunal is required to hold a hearing\u201d (see para. 8).\nIV. Analysis\n[19] The Respondent in the present motion asserts that the Complainant\u2019s allegations spanning the period from April 22, 2008 to July 15 2008 should be dismissed for non-compliance with s. 41(1)(e), as they predate the filing of the complaint by over a year. To the extent the decisions in Oster and Leonardis could be invoked to argue that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain its motion, the Respondent asserts that these authorities are distinguishable:\n\u201cOster and Leonardis are distinguishable from this case because in both of those cases, the respondent challenged an express decision by the CHRC to extend the time limit under Section 41(1)(e). No such express decision was made by the CHRC in this case which is why those cases are not applicable.\u201d (Reply, para. 2)\n[20] Instead, in situations where the Commission does not provide a reasonable justification for extending the time limit under s. 41(1)(e), the Respondent argues that the Vermette judgment applies. According to the Respondent, the Commission provided no such justification in the current matter \u201c\u2026because there was no decision at all....\u201d Neither the Investigation Report nor the decision referring the complaint to the Tribunal expressly indicates that the Commission extended the one-year time limit. It appears to the Respondent that the CHRC did not turn its mind to the issue when investigating the complaint, so there is no CHRC decision for the Tribunal to arguably review, and; moreover, in the absence of a CHRC decision, the Respondent could not judicially review this issue (Notice of Motion, para. 14; Reply, para. 3).\n[21] The Respondent correctly points out that the Vermette judgment\u2014endorsing in obiter the Tribunal\u2019s s. 41 jurisdiction\u2014has not been overturned or overruled by the Federal Court of Appeal. However, it would be fair to say that the Court in Oster adopted a different approach to the application of s. 41(1)(e) by the Tribunal. In Vermette, the Court held that s. 41 created substantive rights to which the Tribunal could give effect if the evidence and circumstances justified such a result. In Oster, the Court notes that the discretionary nature of s. 41(1)(e) is incompatible with the notion that this provision should be interpreted as if it created a legal right not to be investigated. Furthermore, the Oster Court expressed the view that the approach espoused in Vermette could lead to an anomalous result, in the sense that the same CHRC decision under s. 41 could be subject to judicial review by the Federal Court, and to substantive review by the Tribunal.\n[22] The Respondent implies that the two decisions do not conflict: rather, Oster governs situations where the CHRC has decided to extend the time limit in s. 41(1)(e), and Vermette applies where there has been no decision by the Commission under this provision, or no reasonable justification for extending the time. This alleged distinction, however, is not borne out by the judgments themselves. For the following reasons, I find that Vermette and Oster are conflicting judgments that cannot be reconciled by the absence or presence in each respective case of a s. 41 decision by the Commission.\n[23] Firstly, there is no indication in the Vermette judgment that Muldoon J.\u2019s holdings were limited to situations where the Commission had failed to provide a reasonable justification for, or any decision at all in regards to, \u201cextending the time limit.\u201d On the contrary, the Court in Vermette specifically contemplated not one but two s. 41 decisions: the first decision would be made by the Commission but would be of a preliminary and procedural nature\u2014\u201cneither substantive nor ultimate\u201d; the second decision would be made by the Tribunal and would substantively adjudicate whether the Respondent was inappropriately deprived of \u201c\u2026the benefit of the limitation period stated by Parliament\u201d (see paras. 26-29, 33-34). Thus, the reasoning in Vermette does not presume the absence of a Commission decision.\n[24] Secondly, it is not entirely clear that Gibson J.\u2019s holdings in the Oster judgment were contingent upon the presence of a Commission decision to extend time. It is true that the record in Oster clearly revealed the Commission\u2019s consideration of s. 41(1)(e), leading to a decision to deal with the complaint. The Court noted that this decision could have been subject to judicial review, generating a potentially anomalous result where the Tribunal decides the same issue. However, the core holding in Oster is arguably Gibson J\u2019s disagreement with the Court in Vermette as to whether s. 41 confers substantive rights that can be advanced before the Tribunal. Had the Court truly believed that Vermette was distinguishable on its facts, based on the supposed absence of a s. 41(1)(e) decision in that case, Gibson J. could have so indicated. But no such indication is found in the judgment.\n[25] In short, neither judgment indicates that the result would have been different had the Commission issued\u2014or not issued\u2014a clearly articulated set of reasons under s. 41(1)(e). The factual dichotomy proposed by the Respondent to reconcile Oster and Vermette is not supportable.\n[26] The better view of these judgments, and one that the Tribunal has adopted in the past, is that they conflict with each other as to the nature of s. 41, and what it empowers the Tribunal to do or not do. Thus, in Leonardis, the Tribunal found that the Court in Oster had \u201c\u2026reached a different conclusion\u201d from the Court in Vermette, and opted to follow Oster to the effect that s. 41(1) cannot be interpreted to provide additional substantive rights that can be decided upon by the Tribunal (para. 7). Notably, the Tribunal in Leonardis based its decision on Gibson J\u2019s findings of law in Oster, and not on the presence of a s. 41(1)(e) decision by the Commission. In fact, while the Respondent asserts that in Leonardis there was an express decision made by the Commission under this provision which was \u201cchallenged\u201d, this detail is not mentioned in the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, let alone relied upon as a reason for following Oster, as opposed to Vermette.\n[27] Leonardis is not the only decision in which the Tribunal found that Vermette and Oster are irreconcilable. In Cremasco, the Tribunal noted that Vermette \u201c\u2026has been eclipsed by later developments\u201d and that the reasoning in Oster was preferable (see para. 45).\n[28] Like the Tribunal Members in Leonardis and Cremasco, I believe that Vermette and Oster take two different interpretive approaches to s. 41 that cannot be reconciled, and that the approach taken in Oster is preferable.\n[29] It is also important to note that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the alleged factual dichotomy between Vermette and Oster is not consistent with the scheme of s. 41. The Respondent\u2019s assertion in the present case (in an attempt to get around Oster), that the Commission has apparently made \u201cno decision at all\u201d regarding timeliness, obscures the central outcome of section 41 decision-making, namely, a decision by the Commission to either deal with the complaint, or not deal with the complaint. Section 41(1) imposes a positive duty on the Commission to deal with complaints, except if it appears to the Commission that one of the enumerated circumstances applies: \u201cSubject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission\u2026\u201d [emphasis added]. Thus, if the Commission decides to deal with a complaint filed over a year after the fact, it has at the very least implicitly decided to extend the time for filing under s. 41(1)(e).\n[30] Section 41(1)(e) empowers the Commission to deal with complaints that have been filed after \u201c\u2026such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances....\u201d The Respondent supports a disjunctive interpretation of s. 41(1)(e), as if this wording establishes a separate step in the s. 41 decision-making process that is divorced from the decision to \u201cdeal with\u201d the complaint. Granted, it would appear from the above decisions that in some cases the Commission issues reasons that expressly address time extension, and in some it does not. However, the Tribunal is not required to\u2014and generally declines to\u2014embark upon an examination of the Commission\u2019s administrative decision-making to address the impact of these variations.\n[31] In Wall, Dumont, Cremasco, Telus, and Warman, the Tribunal did not focus on the presence or absence of a Commission decision under each paragraph of s. 41(1). Rather, it deferred to the Commission\u2019s discretionary decision to \u201cdeal with\u201d the complaint.\n[32] In Wall, where it was alleged the Commission failed to address s. 41(a) of the CHRA, the Tribunal made it clear that it had no jurisdiction to review decisions that were taken, or the fact that decisions may not have been taken.\n[33] In Dumont, there appears to have been some degree of uncertainty as to whether the Commission issued a formal decision under s. 41(1)(e) to extend time. The Tribunal concluded that \u201cevidently\u201d such decision had been made, allegedly without hearing submissions from the respondent. This however, was a matter for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision, which the respondent in Dumont apparently did not pursue. The Tribunal ruled it did not have jurisdiction to review \u201c\u2026the way in which\u2026\u201d the Commission chooses to exercise its s. 41(1)(e) discretion.\n[34] In Cremasco, the Tribunal expressed itself similarly, observing that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with preliminary objections based on the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under s. 41.\n[35] In Telus, the Tribunal also surmised that \u201cevidently\u201d the Commission did not deem the complaint to be not receivable, having assigned an investigator and then referred the complaint to the Tribunal (see para. 47). After noting that the respondent was entitled to make submissions to the Commission on the late filing of the complaint, it noted that there was no indication in the record that the respondent made this argument before the Commission. The Tribunal ultimately rejected the respondent\u2019s argument under s. 41(1)(e).\n[36] At the end of the day, the basis upon which the Commission decides to \u201cdeal with\u201d a complaint under s. 41 does not shape the way in which the Tribunal exercises its own jurisdiction; the germane consideration from the Tribunal\u2019s perspective is that the Commission has made a request under s. 49 that a Tribunal inquiry be instituted. Section 41 decisions, as well s. 49 decisions, can definitely be challenged, but the venue for such challenges is the Federal Court, in an application for judicial review.\n[37] This clear division of responsibilities between Court, Commission and Tribunal\u2014as enacted in the CHRA and the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7\u2014is fully reflected in the Oster judgment, which is why it constitutes the preferable approach. The Tribunal simply has no jurisdiction to apply s. 41.\n[38] To this must be added the same caveat found in similar Tribunal decisions declining jurisdiction over s. 41 objections: the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to address issues pertaining to how delay in the proceedings impacts the fairness of the hearing, (Grover v. National Research Council of Canada, 2009 CHRT 1, para. 42, aff\u2019d Grover v. Canada (A.G.), 2010 FC 320 (\u201cGrover-FC\u201d)). In its reply submissions, the Respondent asserts that it has been prejudiced by the delay in the filing of the complaint, and that \u201c\u2026evidence of same is set forth in the Investigation Report, which was attached as Exhibit B to the Respondent\u2019s Notice of Motion.\u201d According to the Respondent, certain individuals alleged to have engaged in discrimination, when interviewed by the Investigator, said they could not recall some of the events in question, and their recollections of other events had faded. Another individual did not even remember working with the Complainant. Thus, the delay has severely impacted the Respondent\u2019s ability to defend itself against the allegation that prompted the present motion (see Reply, para. 6).\n[39] In Grover-FC, the Court noted that in order to obtain a stay of proceedings, there must be proof of \u201c\u2026a significant prejudice\u201d and that when that prejudice is said to result from a party\u2019s inability to have a fair hearing, that party must be prepared to adduce evidence to substantiate its claim (see para. 30). The Court described the Grover Tribunal\u2019s evidentiary assessment as follows:\n[31]\u2026The Tribunal heard considerable evidence relating to the issue of delay and the diminished recollections of witnesses. It assessed the credibility of the witnesses and drew inferences for the purposes of determining whether the evidence demonstrated prejudice of a \u201csufficient magnitude to impact on the fairness of the hearing\u201d (Blencoe, above, at para. 104) justifying a dismissal of the complaints\u2026\n[40] In the current matter, to make out a case of prejudice, the Respondent has relied upon statements in the Investigator\u2019s Report recounting conversations with three potential witnesses. While undoubtedly the Tribunal can accept hearsay evidence (s. 50(3)(c))\u2014in this case double-hearsay\u2014the limited probative value of such evidence is manifest, especially in the context of a motion to summarily dismiss an allegation of discrimination. There is no way to assess the veracity, accuracy, extent or impact on the inquiry of the statements allegedly made to the Investigator on the basis of the present motion record. Moreover, the prejudice argument\u2014to the extent it is a separate argument grounded in the fairness of the inquiry\u2014was only put forward in reply; the original motion was framed in terms of s. 41. The submissions on prejudice are insufficient to permit proper consideration of this argument as a separate ground for dismissal.\n[41] For all of the foregoing reasons, the Respondent\u2019s motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 30, 2016\n",

Introduction\n[1] The Complainant is a Canadian citizen and self-identifies as an Arab and a Muslim. He immigrated to Canada from Syria with his family in 1987 when he was 8 years old. He is now a medical doctor specializing in radiology. He is the Chief of Diagnostic Imaging at Bluewater Health Hospital in Sarnia, Ontario. He alleges, under subsection 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), that he was treated in an adverse differential manner in the provision of a service offered by the Respondent airline.\n[2] In June of 2011, Mr. Almalki was refused boarding on an Air Canada flight from London, Ontario to Toronto. It was the first leg of a two-flight trip to Vancouver with his family. Mr. Almalki claims the experience resulted in pain and suffering, harm to dignity and humiliation for himself and his family. He further alleges that he suffered substantial losses of earnings due to the fact Air Canada subsequently would not allow him to fly on certain flights to New Brunswick where he periodically provided locum services.\n[3] Air Canada states it did not discriminate against Mr. Almalki. It contends that Mr. Almalki\u2019s name appeared on an American security list and that the United States Transportation Security Administration (the \u201cTSA\u201d) directed it not to board Mr. Almalki on the flights in question. According to Air Canada, it had no choice in denying Mr. Almalki the services.\n[4] In preparing for the hearing of this case, Mr. Almalki has brought a motion for the disclosure of arguably relevant documents. This motion is the subject of the present ruling.\nII. Disclosure should ordinarily proceed through direct requests between parties\n[5] As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal would like to draw the parties\u2019 attention to the standard practice concerning disclosure. Under Rule 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the \u201cRules\u201d), parties are required to provide additional disclosure and production of documents where new facts, issues or forms of relief are raised by another party\u2019s Statement of Particulars (SOP) or Reply, or where a party discovers there is a flaw in its previous disclosure.\n[6] Parties are expected to first inquire directly with each other for the disclosure of additional documents that do not appear in a party\u2019s document list in their SOP. The Tribunal prefers parties to only avail themselves of the motion process when there is a dispute over the disclosure after such a direct request has been made.\n[7] In the present motion, the Respondent alleges that, \u201c[a] substantial number, if not all, of the records requested were requested for the first time in the Complainant\u2019s motion record.\u201d The Respondent claims that since the filing of the Complainant\u2019s motion, it has responded to all of the Complainant\u2019s requests for disclosure and additional further documentation has been provided.\n[8] If this is the case, then the Tribunal is unnecessarily wading into the disclosure process between the parties. Furthermore, the Complainant has not opted to provide a Reply to Air Canada\u2019s Responding Submissions, resulting in the Tribunal not being aware of which disclosure requests, if any, are currently still in dispute. It is in the interest of all parties to make disclosure requests directly to each other, and to bring disclosure motions before the Tribunal only when the parties are in disagreement.\nIII. Complainant\u2019s Requests for Disclosure\n[9] The Complainant\u2019s motion requests disclosure from Air Canada of the following eight items:\nAny records from the Operation Security Centre (\u201cOSC\u201d) in relation to the Complainant\u2019s attempt to check in for flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011, including communications between on-site and off-site OSC agents, any reports generated from the automated system that identified the Complainant on the \u201cSpecified Persons\u201d list, and records of any communications with the US Transportation Security Administration;\nAll records held by the Respondent regarding the Complainant, including Air Canada\u2019s travel history, previous security logs, bookings records, boarding pass records, passenger name records, passenger assessment system records, customer profiles and preferences;\nFlight charts, plans, over-flight permits, or other information regarding the scheduled and actual routes of flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011, including any internal records and\/or communications identifying specific routes as overflying the US (in particular, for flights AC7702 and AC1173);\nAny internal memoranda or documents with respect to Air Canada\u2019s security obligations and procedures which may have been relied upon to reach its decision not to board the Complainant on flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011;\nAll of the Respondent\u2019s protocols, procedures, policies and training manuals relating to check-in security clearance procedures which were in use on June 18, 2011 along with any confirmations that the Respondent\u2019s employees actually received training on dealing with passengers in relation to security procedures, human rights, and\/or cultural sensitivity;\nRecords of all past complaints against the Respondent alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour and\/or religion, relating to the Respondent\u2019s application of government imposed security lists, along with information regarding the outcomes of these complaints;\nIdentify and provide further and additional particulars of the specific Canadian and\/or US statutes, regulations, agreements, or other rules on which it relied in refusing to board the Complainant on June 18, 2011;and\nProvide a more detailed summary of anticipated testimony of each potential witness.\n[10] In a letter dated August 21, 2015, Air Canada responded to each of the above eight requests. I will address each item below. However, it should be noted that Air Canada advises certain information and\/or documentation is security-sensitive and has been withheld because Air Canada is not permitted to disclose it. In the last case management conference call in this matter, held on July 7, 2015, Respondent counsel advised the other parties of these restrictions and suggested that Complainant counsel may wish to invite submissions from the TSA on his requests for disclosure of the security-sensitive information and\/or documentation. Complainant counsel undertook to give notice to the TSA by July 14, 2015 and request a reply by August 24, 2015. Unfortunately, Complainant counsel did not send notice to the TSA until August 24, 2015. The TSA was invited to send a reply by October 8, 2015 if they wished to make any submissions. To the Tribunal\u2019s knowledge, the TSA did not send any reply before the October 8, 2015 deadline or by the date of this ruling.\nIV. Principles of Disclosure\n[11] Pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of documents allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, the document should be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Rules (see Yaffa v. Air Canada 2014 CHRT 22; Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42 [Guay]; Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 28; and, Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18, at para. 6).\n[12] However, the request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \"fishing expedition.\" The documents requested should be identified with reasonable particularity. Moreover, the request should not subject a party or a stranger to the litigation to an onerous and far-ranging search for the documents (see Guay, at para. 43).\n[13] It should also be noted that the disclosure of arguably relevant documents does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process (see Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28, at para. 4).\nV. Tribunal Ruling\n[14] Set forth below are the eight items requested by Mr. Almalki. Below each request is the response of Air Canada from their letter dated August 21, 2015. Below the Air Canada response is the Tribunal\u2019s decision in respect of each item. It is appropriate to note that the Complainant was given an opportunity to submit a Reply to Air Canada\u2019s submissions. Although the deadline was communicated to the parties, the Complainant did not submit a Reply to the Tribunal, which has made it difficult to assess Air Canada\u2019s objections to disclosure (this will be discussed below).\n1. Any records from the Operation Security Centre (\u201cOSC\u201d) in relation to the Complainant\u2019s attempt to check in for flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011, including communications between on-site and off-site OSC agents, any reports generated from the automated system that identified the Complainant on the \u201cSpecified Persons\u201d list, and records of any communications with the US Transportation Security Administration;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nAir Canada is prohibited from disclosing the requested records as it would fall squarely under the definition of security sensitive information under the aforementioned [see below] statues[sic]. As such, the disclosure of said information would pose a threat to national security and would result in Air Canada being penalized by government agencies, including the TSA. It is our understanding that counsel for the Complainant has undertaken to serve the TSA with his motion materials; however, in spite of numerous requests, we have not been copied with any correspondence directed to the TSA.\n[15] In motion submissions in response to the request, Respondent counsel has cited the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012, SOR\/2011-318 (\u201cCASR\u201d) as prohibiting Air Canada from complying with this disclosure request. Section 235.1 of the CASR reads:\nA person other than the Minister must not disclose security-sensitive information that is created or used under this Division unless the disclosure is required by law or is necessary to comply or facilitate compliance with the aviation security provisions of the Act, regulatory requirements or the requirements of an emergency direction.\n[16] Respondent counsel also claims that certain American regulations also restrict their disclosure of the information requested. Specifically, Air Canada cites 49 Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7\u00a71520.5 to 1520.7, which concern the Protection of Sensitive Security Information, the scope of the regulation and the parties covered. In this last regard, the Respondent submits that a foreign air carrier is a person subject to part 1520.\nTribunal Decision:\n[17] In accordance with the principles of disclosure, I find the materials requested to be of arguable relevance.\n[18] It is unfortunate that Complainant counsel did not reply to the objections, as it is not entirely clear that the objections are valid. Firstly, in regard to the Canadian regulations cited, the CASR appear to expressly permit disclosure in cases where it is \u201crequired by law\u201d which would include, presumably, an order by this Tribunal. With regard to the American law cited, it is not clear to the Tribunal which provision in \u00a71520.5 or \u00a71520.7 actually restricts the disclosure of sensitive security information. Is the CHRT bound by foreign law to the extent that it cannot issue an order for the disclosure of such information? The Tribunal would have entertained submissions on these points as they are likely to be raised again in the course of this inquiry.\n[19] In the absence of reply submissions and any argument to the contrary, the Tribunal makes no order to Air Canada concerning the disclosure of the items sought.\n2. All records held by the Respondent regarding the Complainant, including Air Canada\u2019s travel history, previous security logs, bookings records, boarding pass records, passenger name records, passenger assessment system records, customer profiles and preferences;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nThe Complainant\u2019s Passenger Name Record is attached as TAB 1 and was included in the [sic]Air Canada\u2019s Statement of Particulars. We are in the process of ascertaining whether any further non-security sensitive documentation exists that would include additional information that has not been disclosed thus far and will produce any such relevant documentation, if located.\nTribunal Decision:\n[20] The Tribunal makes no order concerning this item as the Respondent has made certain disclosure and undertakes to give further disclosure if additional relevant documentation is located. In addition, the Complainant has not filed a Reply disputing the adequacy of this response.\n3. Flight charts, plans, over-flight permits, or other information regarding the scheduled and actual routes of flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011, including any internal records and\/or communications identifying specific routes as overflying the US (in particular, for flights AC7702 and AC1173);\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nAs the subject flights took place over four years ago, we are in the process of ascertaining whether any non-security sensitive, arguably relevant documentation exists with respect to the flight routes of the specific flights and will produce any such documentation, if located. Air Canada is prohibited from disclosing any security sensitive records, due to the aforementioned statues [sic]. The disclosure of any security sensitive documentation should be sought from the relevant government authority.\nTribunal Decision:\n[21] Air Canada has advised in its SOP that both flights in question were \u201cconsidered to overfly the United States and are (were) therefore subject to United States Regulations.\u201d\n[22] The Tribunal finds the information requested to be arguably relevant. The Tribunal therefore orders Air Canada to disclose the information requested which indicates whether the air routes of these flights actually entailed the aircraft entering United States airspace, or alternatively, to disclose any documentation that may indicate why the flights may have been deemed to be within U.S. jurisdiction, unless such disclosure is prohibited by the aforementioned legislative authorities. If such disclosure is prohibited, the Respondent will indicate specifically which provisions of the aforementioned regulations actually prohibit the disclosure of documents.\n4. Any internal memoranda or documents with respect to Air Canada\u2019s security obligations and procedures which may have been relied upon to reach its decision not to board the Complainant on flights AC7702 and AC1173 on June 18, 2011;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nThe requested records cannot be disclosed due to their security sensitive nature, pursuant to the aforementioned statues [sic]. The disclosure of said information would endanger the public and would result in Air Canada being penalized by government agencies, including the TSA.\nTribunal Decision:\n[23] By the above response, it appears that such documents may exist and I would find them to be arguably relevant. It is unfortunate that the Respondent did not specify under which legislative provisions it would be subjected to government penalties. Furthermore, it is noted that Parliament gave the Tribunal the power under s. 52 of the Act to take confidentiality measures vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cpublic security\u201d, or endangerment to \u201clife, liberty or security of a person.\u201d Therefore, the Tribunal would be interested to know why there could not be compliance with this request in light of s. 52. However, having received no reply argument from Complainant counsel, the Tribunal makes no order concerning this request at this time.\n5. All of the Respondent\u2019s protocols, procedures, policies and training manuals relating to check-in security clearance procedures which were in use on June 18, 2011 along with any confirmations that the Respondent\u2019s employees actually received training on dealing with passengers in relation to security procedures, human rights, and\/or cultural sensitivity;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nDeemed High Profile (DHP) training is provided as part of an initial training course. Furthermore, it is required that DHP training be renewed every two years. DHP training is currently included in three modules, entitled Security in Your Workplace, which is part of an initial course that is mandatory for all new employees. It is also included in two other courses, entitled Security a Way of Life and Security and Operational Awareness. These courses do not pertain solely to DHP training. Nevertheless, we enclose the course materials of said modules that deal specifically with the topic at TAB 2. Note that sections have been redacted as they contain confidential and security sensitive information.\nIn addition to the aforementioned modules\/courses, Air Canada employees also have access to documentation that discusses the DHP list, including the document entitled Security Clearances for Deemed High Profile (DHP) Edits, found at TAB 2.\nAir Canada also offers training courses that deal with general topics such as harassment. These courses address human rights as well as themes such as respect, which would be integral to cultural sensitivity. At TAB 3, we enclose excerpts from a course on the subject of employee relations and harassment that provide an example of such materials.\nTribunal Decision:\n[24] Given the significant disclosure made in response to this request, and having received no reply submissions from the Complainant from which to determine the satisfactoriness of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, the Tribunal makes no order concerning this item.\n6. Records of all past complaints against the Respondent alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour and\/or security lists, along with information regarding the outcomes of these complaints;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nAir Canada received complaints in the recent past pertaining to discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour and security lists as follows:\n\uf0b7 In 2008, there were a total of 12 complaints made that appear to allege discrimination based on nationality only and 1 based on ethnic origin.\n\uf0b7 In 2009, there were a total of 4 complaints made, two of which appear to allege discrimination based on nationality and two of which pertain to race.\n\uf0b7 In 2010, there were 1 complaint made that appears to allege discrimination based on race and 2 based on ethnic origin.\n\uf0b7 In 2011, there were 7 complaints made that appear to allege discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n\uf0b7 In 2012, there were 6 complaints made that appear to allege discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n\uf0b7 In 2013, there were 2 complaints made that appear to allege discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n\uf0b7 In 2014, there was 1 complaint made that appears to allege discrimination based on ethnic origin.\nIn summary, from the period of 2008 onwards, Air Canada has identified a total of 35 complaints, 18 of which pertain to ethnic origin, 14 of which pertain to nationality and 3 of which pertain to race. With respect to the 35 claims, 30 were resolved by way of a letter sent to the complainant explaining the security requirements and 1 was resolved on a confidential basis following a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. To date, 4 remain unresolved.\nRecords with respect to the same would contain private and confidential information pertaining to uninvolved third parties, which cannot be severed from the records and thus, cannot be disclosed, pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5.\nTribunal Decision:\n[25] Given the significant disclosure made in response to this request, and having received no reply submissions from the Complainant from which to determine the satisfactoriness of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, the Tribunal makes no order concerning this item. However, the Tribunal notes that subsection 7(3)(c) of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (supra) permits disclosure without knowledge or consent of the individuals concerned where the disclosure is \u201c\u2026required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with rules of court relating to the production of records;\u201d (see Thambiah v. Maritime Employers Association, 2009 CHRT 30, at para. 4).\n7. Identify and provide further and additional particulars of the specific Canadian and\/or US statutes, regulations, agreements, or other rules on which it relied in refusing to board the Complainant on June 18, 2011;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nThe relevant statutes and regulations have been identified in Air Canada\u2019s Statement of Particulars. The documentation from the TSA, which was relied upon by Air Canada is expressly categorized as security sensitive by s. 1520.7(b) of 49 Code of Federal Regulations and thus, cannot be disclosed by Air Canada in the absence of the TSA\u2019s consent. Furthermore, said documentation includes particulars of confidential security procedures, the disclosure of which would pose a threat to national aviation security.\nTribunal Decision:\n[26] Having received no reply submissions from the Complainant from which to determine the satisfactoriness of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, the Tribunal makes no order concerning this item.\n8. Provide a more detailed summary of anticipated testimony of each potential witness;\nAir Canada\u2019s Response:\nThe witness(es) called by Air Canada have yet to be determined; however, the anticipated testimony will be primarily focused on the main issue of whether or not Air Canada discriminated against the Complainant based on a prohibited ground in its application of security procedures. It will be Air Canada\u2019s evidence that the security procedures in the within matter were applied equally and without exception to every single passenger on the subject flight and thus, Air Canada did not discriminate based on a prohibited ground.\nTribunal Decision:\n[27] Having received no reply submissions from the Complainant to determine the satisfactoriness of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, the Tribunal makes no order concerning this item. However, it is presumed and directed that when individual witnesses are identified, timely disclosure will be made to the other parties in accordance with Rules 6(1)(f) and 6(5).\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Thomas\nTable of Contents\nI. Request for disclosure 1\nII. Reasons for the request 1\nIII. Ruling 3\nIV. Legal Framework 3\nV. Analysis 4\nI. Request for disclosure\n[1] This request for disclosure arises in the context of a Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d) complaint filed by Mr. Yaffa against Air Canada. Mr. Yaffa alleges the airline discriminated against him by subjecting him to enhanced security screening because of his race, national or ethnic origin, colour and religion, on six different occasions from March to June 2010. As a result of Air Canada\u2019s alleged actions, Mr. Yaffa claims to have suffered depression, anxiety, insomnia and diminished self-esteem, for which he seeks compensation.\n[2] By way of motion, Air Canada requests that Mr. Yaffa and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) produce all materials related to another human rights complaint filed by Mr. Yaffa against Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d). That complaint relates to events that occurred in March of 2009, prior to the events in issue in the present complaint, and alleges CBSA officials targeted and unfairly subjected Mr. Yaffa to a secondary screening at Pearson International Airport because of his race, colour and religion. In the complaint against CBSA, Mr. Yaffa stated that the experience left him \u201cpsychologically tormented and significantly stressed\u201d and that he had subsequently travelled three times after the incident and that each time he found himself \u201crecalling the scenarios and becoming nervous, among other things.\u201d\nII. Reasons for the request\n[3] As part of the ongoing disclosure process, which was the subject of an earlier ruling (see Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22), Mr. Yaffa provided Air Canada with a copy of a complaint form letter against CBSA that he had previously filed with the Commission. After reviewing the complaint form letter, Air Canada requested further disclosure. Air Canada argues that the circumstances giving rise to the CBSA complaint and the complaint against it appear to be similar, insofar as they both involve incidents that transpired at Canadian airports, within the context of secondary screenings, and as a result of which the Complainant alleges psychological injuries. Furthermore, in both complaints, the Complainant alleges the incidents were a result of his race, colour and religion.\n[4] Air Canada adds that the incident against CBSA and the alleged psychological injuries associated therewith chronologically preceded the incidents alleged against Air Canada by only one year. Furthermore, Mr. Yaffa alleges similar psychological injuries against Air Canada and seeks compensation for said injuries, notwithstanding that the alleged injuries may have been pre-existing and for which he may have already received compensation from CBSA by way of a settlement.\n[5] In Air Canada\u2019s view, in order for it to know the case against it and be permitted to respond to that case, it must be given the opportunity to explore whether Mr. Yaffa seeks compensation from Air Canada for previously existing psychological injuries attributable to CBSA's conduct. Furthermore, any admissions of liability, terms of resolution, including compensation paid to Mr. Yaffa for psychological injuries, would be material to these proceedings given the similarity in the nature of the allegations raised against Air Canada and the compensation sought by Mr. Yaffa.\n[6] Pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the CHRA, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant documents in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of documents allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, it should be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (see Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22).\n[7] The CBSA complaint was settled before the Commission decided whether it warranted an inquiry before the Tribunal. Mr. Yaffa and the Commission have confirmed that the only requested materials in their possession that relate to the CBSA complaint are the initial complaint form letter itself, which has already been disclosed to Air Canada, and documents related to the mediation of the complaint and the terms of its settlement. They deny that any investigation report or other materials requested by Air Canada exist. Both Mr. Yaffa and the Commission object to the disclosure of the mediation and settlement documents as, in their view, they are not arguably relevant to the issues in the present case. Furthermore, they submit the documents are privileged and, as such, are not compellable in the absence of exceptional circumstances.\n[8] CBSA was also invited to provide submissions with respect to Air Canada\u2019s request for disclosure. It agrees with Mr. Yaffa and the Commission that the mediation and settlement documents should not be disclosed. CBSA argues that the materials have no probative value and that Air Canada has not adequately shown a nexus between the documentation sought and the issues in dispute in this matter.\nIII. Ruling\n[9] For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s motion, but on terms and conditions set out herein.\nIV. Legal Framework\n[10] This ruling stems from subsection 50(4) of the CHRA, which prohibits the Tribunal from admitting or accepting anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence. In the present matter, the privilege asserted is settlement privilege.\n[11] In Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp., 2013 SCC 37 (\u201cSable\u201d), the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the importance of settlements to the judicial system and the importance of settlement privilege to the administration of justice:\n[11] Settlements allow parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution to their dispute without prolonging the personal and public expense and time involved in litigation. The benefits of settlement were summarized by Callaghan A.C.J.H.C. in Sparling v. Southam Inc. (1988), 1988 CanLII 4694 (ON SC), 66 O.R. 225 (H.C.J.):\n\u2026.the courts consistently favour the settlement of lawsuits in general. To put it another way, there is an overriding public interest in favour of settlement. This policy promotes the interests of litigants generally by saving them the expense of trial of disputed issues, and it reduces the strain upon an already overburdened provincial court system\u2026..\n[12] Settlement privilege promotes settlements. As the weight of the jurisprudence confirms, it is a class privilege. As with other class privileges, while there is a prima facie presumption of inadmissibility, exceptions will be found \u201cwhen the justice of the case requires it\u201d (Rush & Tompkins Ltd. V. Greater London Council (1988) 3 All E.R. 737 (H.L.) at p. 740).\n[12] Settlement privilege is based on the understanding that parties will be more likely to settle if they have confidence from the outset that their negotiations will not be disclosed. Settlement negotiations are protected, whether or not final settlement is ever reached, and settlement privilege extends to the content of any concluded agreement (Sable, at paras. 13, 17-18).\n[13] The Supreme Court acknowledged in Sable that there are exceptions to settlement privilege, where \u201c\u2026a competing public interest outweighs the public interest in encouraging settlement.\u201d Such competing public interests have included the need to prevent a plaintiff from being overcompensated (Sable, at para.19).\nV. Analysis\n[14] Under section 50 of the CHRA, the Tribunal must afford the parties \u201ca full and ample opportunity\u201d to present evidence and make representations, subject to the prohibition on receiving anything protected by the law of privilege.\n[15] The Respondent in this case argues that it is imperative that it be given the opportunity to explore whether the Complainant seeks compensation for previously existing psychological injuries attributable to CBSA\u2019s conduct that pre-dated the alleged incidents in the current complaint. In particular, the Respondent asserts that any admissions of liability, terms of resolution, including compensation paid for psychological injury would be material to the within proceedings. The Respondent submits that any failure to produce the subject documents will prejudice its ability to defend itself.\n[16] As stated above, since settlement privilege is a class privilege, the requested documents pertaining to the mediation and settlement (\u201cthe settlement documents\u201d) are accorded a prima facie presumption of inadmissibility, and the party contesting the presumption has the burden of establishing that an exception to the class privilege applies: Sable, at para. 19; see also Dos Santos v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 2005 BCCA 4, at para. 19 (\u201cDos Santos\u201d); and, Brown v. Cape Breton (Regional Municipality), 2011 NSCA 32, at paras. 59-61 (\u201cBrown\u201d).\n[17] In answer to the claim of settlement privilege, the Respondent invokes the exception allowing for the admissibility of material necessary to prevent a party from being overcompensated. In this regard, it relies on the Dos Santos judgment where the court ordered the disclosure of a settlement agreement in an insurance action.\n[18] In Dos Santos, the plaintiff\u2019s wife was receiving long-term disability benefits under an employment group insurance policy with Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada. The policy\u2019s subrogation clause provided that if the disability was caused by the negligence of a third party, 75% of the employee\u2019s net recovery for loss of income in any action must be repaid to the insurer, to the extent of the benefits paid or payable (Dos Santos, at para. 4).\n[19] The plaintiff commenced an action against the driver of the car which injured his wife, and the driver was held 100% at fault. Damages were then mediated with the driver\u2019s insurer, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (\u201cI.C.B.C.\u201d). Sun Life claimed it was entitled to see the documents underling the mediated settlement so it could tell what sum was paid in respect of lost income (Dos Santos, at paras. 6-7).\n[20] The B.C. Court of Appeal agreed, holding that the plaintiff had clearly put into issue the subrogation rights of Sun Life under the disability policy. The documents were accordingly relevant and necessary. In the words of the Court: \u201c[i]n the case at bar, there is a clear relationship between the sums the plaintiff seeks from the defendant and the sums the plaintiff may have already received in settlement with I.C.B.C.\u201d (Dos Santos, at paras. 25 and 33).\n[21] There are a number of difficulties in applying the Dos Santos case to the current matter before the Tribunal. First of all, and of greatest significance, the relevance and necessity of disclosing the settlement in the Dos Santos case was manifest; the requesting party, Sun Life, had a contractual right to be indemnified for any monies received by the plaintiff from or on behalf of the negligent third party. In the current matter, the Respondent, Air Canada, has no contractual right of indemnification vis-\u00e0-vis any monies received by the Complainant from CBSA.\n[22] Secondly, in Dos Santos, it is clear that the requesting party is seeking disclosure of settlement terms governing payments by a third party in respect of the very same incident. In the current matter, while there is a potential for overlap, it is not clear that the incidents giving rise to the CBSA complaint are the same as those giving rise to the Air Canada complaint. In any event, the current matter involves multiple incidents. It is quite possible that there is no overlap at all, and that the incidents mentioned in the CBSA complaint entirely predate the Air Canada allegations.\n[23] A more analogous fact situation arose in the Brown case, supra. In Brown, the plaintiff had suffered two separate injuries to her knee, by two separate defendants. She settled the claim in respect of the second injury, and the defendant to the first claim sought disclosure of the settlement agreement and related correspondence. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Brown followed Dos Santos to the extent that it acknowledged that settlement privilege is subject to exceptions, and that the obvious exception that could apply to the matter at hand involved the risk of double recovery (Brown, at para. 72). However, in Brown, the Court refused to order disclosure at that stage of the proceedings given that the relevance of the settlement communications had not thus far been established, and was a matter for the trial judge (Brown, at paras. 73-74).\n[24] Of particular interest in Brown is the Court\u2019s insistence on evidence of indivisibility of the two injuries. Relying on the judgment in Athey v. Leonati, 1996 CanLII 183 (SCC), the Court held that as a general proposition, where there is more than one cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injury, the Court must first determine whether that injury is divisible or indivisible (Brown, at para. 15). It then concluded as follows:\n[23] Relevancy is a question of law: R. v. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 at para. 18. The medical evidence before the Chambers judge in this matter was extremely limited. It falls far short of providing the court with sufficient information to decide whether the injuries to Ms. Brown\u2019s knee were indivisible within the meaning of Athey. Without evidence which could support that determination one cannot say whether settlement information from the 2004 accident was relevant. In ordering disclosure, the Chambers judge erred in law\u2026\n[25] In the current matter before the Tribunal, the hearing has not yet commenced, and no evidence has been adduced about the Complainant\u2019s psychological injuries. Nor has any evidence been led on the issue of whether one or more of the three subsequent flights referred to in the CBSA complaint are in fact coincident with one of the five flights referred to in the Air Canada complaint.\n[26] The Respondent concedes in its reply submissions that \u201cit is unclear whether there is an overlap\u201d between the incidents referred to in the two complaints, and whether the Complainant continued to experience the psychological effects of the incidents giving rise to the CBSA complaint when he flew with Air Canada. But it then asserts that:\nNone of the responding parties have provided any argument or evidence to put this concern to rest, nor have they confirmed that the three subsequent travel incidents referred to were not with Air Canada, on dates relevant to the within complaint.\n[27] While the Respondent makes an interesting observation, the difficulty with this submission is that it implies the other parties have the burden of demonstrating that the settlement documents should not be disclosed. However, as was explained above, it is the requesting party that has the burden of establishing an exception to the privilege which presumptively attaches to settlement documents. In the absence of sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, settlement privilege applies (Brown, at para. 23).\n[28] This situation may change after the hearing commences, and the Complainant testifies and is subject to cross-examination. If and when an appropriate evidentiary foundation has been laid, the Tribunal would be willing to consider a similar motion for disclosure that underscores the relevance and necessity of the documents based on the evidence adduced. At that point, the potential for double recovery or over-compensation could be properly ascertained.\n[29] The Tribunal has in the past been vigilant in guarding against the possibility of double recovery, as evidenced by such rulings as Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, 2011 CHRT 12 (\u201cPalm\u201d), where the Tribunal, relying on Dos Santos, ordered disclosure of settlement agreements with two employer respondents in a case proceeding against three union respondents. It is noteworthy, however, that the Tribunal found that the complaints\u2014though not identical\u2014were \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d (Palm, at para. 8). In particular, it was clear from a reading of the complaints that they all referred to the same two-month period at the same workplace establishment (Palm, at para. 7).\n[30] In contrast, in the current matter, the potential for factual overlap remains speculative. The two complaints being compared in this case do not display the same \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d as did the five complaints at issue in Palm. That is not to say that the CBSA complaint and the Air Canada complaint are unrelated. Rather, it is to say that at the current stage of proceedings, it is simply not possible to ascertain the extent or degree of their connectedness with the level of certainty that is required to rebut the presumption of settlement privilege. The Dos Santos judgment itself cautions against setting the test too low, as the public policy behind settlement privilege is a compelling one.\n[31] Overcompensation is a possibility in this case, but its reality must be established before settlement privilege can be rebutted. The Tribunal invited the parties to consider a bifurcation of this inquiry, so that the potential overlap between the CBSA allegations and the Air Canada allegations could be fully explored during a hearing focussed on liability only. If and when liability had been established, the disclosure issues regarding overcompensation could then be considered and decided on a solid evidentiary footing. They might even be resolved consensually: see Sable, at para. 25. In spite of the apparent advantages of this approach, the parties declined the Tribunal\u2019s invitation.\n[32] The motion for production of the settlement documents is hereby dismissed, without prejudice to the moving party\u2019s right to present it again after probative evidence has been adduced regarding the nature of the CBSA allegations vis-\u00e0-vis the Air Canada allegations and, in particular, regarding the degree and extent of any overlap between: (a) the incidents comprising the two complaints; and, (b) the psychological harm allegedly caused thereby.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Analysis 22\nVI. Order 26\nI. Background\n[1] This case involves three Complaints dated March 30, 2012 that were filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on April 4, 2012 by Mr. Bruce Beattie. The Commission requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the Complaints on a consolidated basis on October 1, 2013, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA).\n[2] Mr. Beattie filed the Complaints on behalf of Ms. Joyce Beattie, Ms. Jenelle Brewer and Mr. James Louie who are alleged in the Complaints to be victims of discrimination by the Respondent on the grounds of their race, national or ethnic origin, by reason of the Respondent\u2019s refusal to register certain land documents in the Indian Reserve Land Register (the Register) established under section 21 of the Indian Act (the Act), contrary to section 5 of the CHRA. Ms. Beattie, Ms. Brewer and Mr. Louie, by letters dated August 30 and 31, 2012, authorized Mr. Beattie to act as their representative for the purpose of the Complaints that were filed.\n[3] Mr. Louie, who died on March 28, 2015, was a member of the Okanagan Indian Band and a registered Indian under the Act. Ms. Brewer is also a registered Indian under the Act and a member of the Okanagan Indian Band. Ms. Beattie, who is the spouse of Mr. Beattie, is also a registered Indian under the Act but is not a member of the Okanagan Indian Band.\n[4] Mr. Beattie, who is not an Indian, has also alleged that he was a Complainant in this case, in addition to acting as the agent or representative of Mr. Louie and his estate, Ms. Brewer and Ms. Beattie. The Complaints do not specify the basis of any alleged discrimination suffered by him.\n[5] By way of a letter dated May 8, 2015 the Commission advised the Tribunal and the parties that it was not going to participate in the matter or appear at the hearing after initially participating.\n[6] Ms. Beattie attended the hearing but was not called as a witness. Ms. Brewer did not attend the hearing. No one from Mr. Louie\u2019s family attended the hearing. Mr. Beattie attended the hearing as the representative for the Complainants and also gave evidence as a witness for the Complainants. No written proof was provided to the Tribunal confirming Mr. Beattie\u2019s authority to represent Mr. Louie\u2019s estate.\n[7] Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act provides Canada with exclusive legislative authority in respect of \u201cIndians and Lands reserved for Indians\u201d. The Respondent (known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada prior to May 2011 and known as Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada since November 2015) is the Government of Canada department responsible for administering the Act including the system of Indian land reserves under the land management provisions of the Act. Ms. Sheila Craig, the Manager of Lands Modernization in the Respondent\u2019s Lands and Economic Development British Columbia Regional Office, appeared as a witness for the Respondent.\nII. Relevant Legislation\n[8] The following legislation is relevant to this case and is reproduced below, namely sections 3(1) and 5 of the CHRA and sections 2(1)(a), 18(1), 20(1) and (2), 21, 24, 28(1) and (2) and 58(3) of the Act.\nCanadian Human Rights Act\nProhibited grounds of discrimination\n3(1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\nDenial of good, service, facility or accommodation\n5 It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nIndian Act\n2 (1) In this Act,\nMinister means the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development; (ministre)\nreserve\n(a) means a tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band, and\nReserves to be held for use and benefit of Indians\n18 (1) Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.\nPossession of lands in a reserve\n20 (1) No Indian is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve unless, with the approval of the Minister, possession of the land has been allotted to him by the council of the band.\nCertificate of Possession\n(2) The Minister may issue to an Indian who is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve a certificate, to be called a Certificate of Possession, as evidence of his right to possession of the land described therein.\nRegister\n21 There shall be kept in the Department a register, to be known as the Reserve Land Register, in which shall be entered particulars relating to Certificates of Possession and Certificates of Occupation and other transactions respecting lands in a reserve.\nTransfer of possession\n24 An Indian who is lawfully in possession of lands in a reserve may transfer to the band or another member of the band the right to possession of the land, but no transfer or agreement for the transfer of the right to possession of lands in a reserve is effective until it is approved by the Minister.\nGrants, etc., of reserve lands void\n28 (1) Subject to subsection (2), any deed, lease, contract, instrument, document or agreement of any kind, whether written or oral, by which a band or a member of a band purports to permit a person other than a member of that band to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise any rights on a reserve is void.\nMinister may issue permits\n(2) The Minister may by permit in writing authorize any person for a period not exceeding one year, or with the consent of the council of the band for any longer period, to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise rights on a reserve.\nLease at request of occupant\n58(3) The Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being designated.\nIII. Facts\nA. Chronology\n[9] The lands that are the subject of this case are located within the Okanagan Indian Reserve near Vernon British Columbia and include two parcels described as Lot 170-1 and Lot 175, Block 4, Plan 93082 CLSR in Indian Reserve No.1. These lands were allotted to Mr. Louie by the council of the Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1 and the allotment was approved by the Minister of the Respondent evidenced by Certificates of Possession (CP) registered in the Register under section 20 of the Act.\n[10] In June 2007, Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie applied for a ministerial lease under section 58(3) of the Act with respect to Lot 170-1. In January 2008, they applied for a ministerial lease under section 58(3) of the Act for Lot 175. These applications were refused by the Respondent on the basis of various interpretations it made respecting requirements it said were not fulfilled by the applications. The requirements it said were not fulfilled, in its interpretation, included a requirement that a lease had to be provided at fair market value or else a locatee needed to provide a justification to the Respondent; a requirement that a locatee could not lease his own land held subject to a Certificate of Possession, without incorporating; and a requirement that recognized legally adopted children but not custom adopted children.\n[11] The refusals of these applications resulted in several complaints under the CHRA in 2008 and 2010 in which Mr. Beattie acted as agent for the complainants. All of these complaints were found to have been substantiated on their merits after hearings before the Tribunal, although a judicial review application by the Respondent regarding the implementation of one of the decisions was successful. Ultimately, all of these decisions involving ministerial leases stood, on their merits, as discrimination was found by the Tribunal to have occurred. Decisions of the Tribunal in the matters related to the 2008 complaints were issued by former Member Craig in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (Beattie and Louie v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada 2011 CHRT 2, 2012 CHRT 2, 2013 CHRT 17). Decisions of the Tribunal in the matters related to the 2010 complaints were issued by me in 2014 (Beattie v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada 2014 CHRT 1 and Beattie and Louie v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada 2014 CHRT 7). While the lots in question in those cases were the same lots as in this case, the prior cases all involved section 58(3) ministerial leases, unlike this case which involves private leases, without the Crown. None of the interpretations that prompted the Complaints related explicitly to statutory requirements.\n[12] As a result of these previous cases, the Respondent reversed some of its interpretations and revised some of its internal practices for issuing ministerial leases. Also, beginning in July 2013, the Respondent\u2019s land policies and practices were reviewed and amended to ensure, according to the Respondent, that its new Locatee Policy and Directive provided an enabling process for locatees to lease their lands. The changes, however, did not remove the requirement for the Crown to be a party to a lease nor did the changes require modifications to the Respondent\u2019s practice of requiring Crown consent before a lessee could sublet or assign a lease. Nevertheless, over the Summer of 2011, there was extensive correspondence between the Respondent and Mr. Beattie and several draft ministerial leases were exchanged, however, the parties were not able to reach an agreement on a ministerial lease under section 58(3). So in the latter part of 2011 during the Tribunal\u2019s handling of the earlier complaints, Mr. Beattie on behalf of the Complainants changed his approach and departed from using ministerial leases to accomplish the leases in favour of private leases without the Crown.\n[13] Two applications for registration, dated July 25, 2011, were submitted by Mr. Beattie to the Registrar. The applications were received on July 27, 2011. Each application attached a lease. One lease, regarding Lot 170-1, named Mr. Louie as lessor and Ms. Beattie as lessee. The other lease, regarding Lot 175, named Mr. Louie as lessor and Ms. Brewer as lessee. Both leases were dated July 25 with an effective date of August 1, 2011.\n[14] By letter, dated July 26, 2011, Mr. Beattie wrote to Mr. Sidney Restall, legal counsel with the Department of Justice, and advised him the Complainants had substituted the locatee in place of the Crown as lessor on the Lot 170-1 lease.\n[15] By letter, dated July 29, 2011, Mr. Restall wrote to Mr. Beattie that he was not aware of any requirement for registering the lease between Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie accompanying Mr. Beattie\u2019s letter of July 26, 2011. Mr. Restall wrote, \u201cI am not aware of any requirement for such a lease to be registered by the Minister of AANDC.\u201d He concluded, \u201cGiven your lease initiative, I take it that no further Crown involvement is required.\u201d\n[16] By another letter dated July 29, 2011, Mr. Restall wrote Mr. Beattie that with respect to Lot 175, \u201cThe lease document you have provided involves a different party from the original application. This will have to be reviewed by the Crown. The attached application for registration is likely premature.\u201d\n[17] An Application for Registration for an Assignment of Lease, signed March 1, 2012 was submitted to the Indian Land Registry by Mr. Beattie. Ms. Brewer was identified in the document as the assignor and Ms. Beattie was identified as the assignee and Mr. Louie signed the document to indicate his consent. The Application indicated that the Assignment of Lease was intended to assign the lease between Mr. Louie and Ms. Brewer regarding Lot 175 and was received on or about March 7, 2012.\n[18] The Assignment of Lease contained three conditions. Condition \u201cA\u201d provides:\nA. Pursuant to the Indian Act, the Premises are lands reserved for the use and benefit of the Okanagan Indian Band (hereinafter \u201cthe Band\u201d) of which the Assignor is a member, and this Assignment of Lease shall have no effect on the reserve status of the Premises nor shall this Assignment of Lease be construed to diminish or otherwise effect [sic: affect] the lawful authority of the Band to regulate or otherwise govern the use and occupation of the Premises.\n[19] Condition \u201cC\u201d of the Assignment states, \u201c...the Parties will submit this Assignment of Lease for registration in the Indian Land Registry on or before the effective date of this Assignment of Lease.\u201d\n[20] By letter, dated March 7, 2012, Mr. Beattie wrote to Ms. Fiona McFarlane, legal counsel with the Department of Justice. He stated that he had received confirmation that morning that the application to register the Assignment had been received by the Indian Land Registry in Ottawa and asked for a response that same day providing an assurance that counsel had not instructed the Indian Land Registry to suspend or delay consideration of the application.\n[21] Ms. McFarlane replied to Mr. Beattie on March 9, 2012. She wrote that the Complainants would be advised of the Respondent\u2019s decisions on the Lot 170-1 lease, Lot 175 lease, and assignment of the Lot 175 lease at a later date. Ms. McFarlane noted that the Respondent had two leases for Lot 175 with different lessees--a ministerial lease between the Minister and Mr. Louie dated June 1, 2011 and a private lease without reference to the Minister between Mr. Louie and Ms. Brewer dated August 1, 2011. Ms. McFarlane asked Mr. Beattie for clarification of what he wanted to do with Lot 175.\n[22] Mr. Beattie responded to Ms. McFarlane on March 9, 2012. He confirmed that all previous applications (i.e. the ministerial leases) submitted pursuant to section 58(3) of the Act were either replaced by the applicants or rejected by the Respondent and that the lease documents had been returned to the complainants. Mr. Beattie also advised that the only lease acceptable to Mr. Louie for Lot 175 was the lease dated July 25\/August 1, 2011 (i.e. a private lease) and assigned to Ms. Brewer with an effective date of March 1, 2012 and that the only lease acceptable to Mr. Louie for Lot 170-1 was the lease dated July 25\/August 1, 2011 (i.e. also a private lease). By letter dated March 27, 2012, Mr. Beattie wrote to Ms. McFarlane that no section 58(3) lease existed in respect to Lot 170-1 since April 11, 2011 and the no future section 58(3) lease was anticipated.\n[23] The three Complaints in this matter dated March 30, 2012, were submitted to the Commission on April 4, 2012 alleging discrimination by the Respondent against Mr. Louie, Ms. Brewer, and Ms. Beattie on the grounds of their race, national or ethnic origin (as registered Indians), by reason of the denial of a service, customarily available to the public, contrary to section 5 of the CHRA, as a result of the refusal of the Respondent to register their private leases and assignment under section 21 of the Act.\n[24] By letter dated September 30, 2013, Mr. Daryl Hargitt, Lands Registrar, Lands and Environmental Operations of the Respondent advised Mr. Beattie that the Applications for Registration covering the private leases (and the assignment of lease) could not be registered in the Registry because the leases did not indicate Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as lessor, did not indicate the Crown as a party nor had Ministerial approval been provided. Mr. Hargitt noted that he could only locate the March 2012 Application for Registration of the Assignment of Lease but not the actual Assignment itself being received in the Registry. He further stated that as the private lease between Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie was not acceptable for registration, the subsequent assignment would also not be registrable.\n[25] Mr. Beattie wrote to Mr. Hargitt on October 16, 2013 requesting that the rejections of the Applications for Registration be rescinded and assurances provided that the Applications for Registration be completed upon resubmission of the registration documents. He further advised that each of the transactions had a \u201cmarketable value of $200,000\u201d and that this would be claimed against Canada in the event that the registrations did not proceed.\n[26] The private leases and assignment of lease were all received by the Respondent during the time that the 2006 Indian Land Registration Manual (the Manual) was in effect but the refusal to register the documents took place when the 2013 Manual had come into effect. Under the 2013 Manual aboriginal persons are no longer required to include their racial, national or ethnic (i.e. Indian Act) identification on new Applications for Registration.\nB. The Land Management System\n[27] The Act governs all dealings with respect to Indian lands for those First Nations operating under the land management provisions of the Act. Some First Nations have assumed responsibility for administering their own reserve lands under the First Nations Land Management Act or other arrangements with Canada, however, the Okanagan Indian Reserve where this case took place is administered by Canada pursuant to the Act.\n[28] The Respondent is legislatively responsible for various aspects of the management of Indian reserve land and the registration of interests in reserve land. As part of this, it administers the Indian Land Registry System (IRLS) and has created the Manual to assist its staff in the process of registering instruments for land transactions on reserves. The current Manual replaced the 2006 version in July of 2013. As noted above, section 21 of the Act states as follows: \u201cThere shall be kept in the Department a register, to be known as the Reserve Land Register, in which shall be entered particulars relating to Certificates of Possession and Certificates of Occupation and other transactions respecting lands in a reserve.\u201d According to the Manual, the Register \u201crecords instruments respecting lands which are allotted to individual band members (locatee lands) as well as other transactions.\u201d The Registrar of Indian Lands (the Registrar) is the title of the person designated to receive, process and enter\/register documents.\n[29] The Manual provides guidance about the ILRS (and the Register) as follows:\na) Generally\ni) \u201cit was established to provide a reliable, internet-based, computerized registry of registered interests in reserve lands in Canada.\u201d\nii) \u201cit is a repository of documentation and does not purport to guarantee title or accuracy of documentation filed therein, nor does it give priority to any interests...\u201d\niii) \u201cit records information concerning interests registered against reserve lands.\u201d While \u201cthe land register provides a list of transactions that affect a parcel of land, the nature of the transaction and the scope of the interest.\u201d and \u201c...once recorded, transactions cannot be deleted, thus transactions remain on record as part of the history of the reserve or parcel even though they may be discharged or expired.\u201d\niv) \u201cit is guided by a set of interacting procedures designed to govern the registration of rights or interests, claims of interest, or notices of claims of interest in reserve land.\u201d\nv) \u201cMost provincial systems deal with recording title to lands; however, in the ILRS, title remains with the Crown and transactions in land are registered.\u201d\nb) Definition of ILRS\nA database of instruments registered in the [ILRS] relating to Reserve Lands and Crown Lands. The ILRS generates Registration Numbers and Evidence of Title (EOT) numbers and is the authoritative source for reserve names. The ILRS allows all users to perform enquiries and generate reports on data in the system. Electronic images of instruments registered in the Indian Lands Registry System can be viewed and printed from the system.\nc) Description of the purpose of ILRS\nto fulfill the statutory requirements of the Indian Act,\nto record interests approved and submitted for registration in Indian reserve, Designated and Surrendered lands,\nto safeguard interests that have been registered,\nto provide timely and reliable information to clientele, and to provide safekeeping of original instruments and documents submitted for registration.\nd) Definition of Registration\nThe process of inserting into the record the various transactions and supporting documentation affecting a given parcel of land. The registration of transactions gives public notice regarding the nature of an interest on land; and enables persons interested in a property to determine the rights of all parties with an interest in that particular properly.\ne) Definition of Leases\nAnyone who Leases land from another acquires a leasehold interest in that land; such an interest is called a \u201cLease\u201d. The possessor of the interest is the \u201clessor\u201d, namely Crown Canada, while the person who acquired the interest is the \u201clessee \u201c.A leasehold interest must have a definable time period, the term, or a time period that can be established. The term of the instrument includes all provisions for renewal or extension of the right or interest. The holder of a Leasehold interest has exclusive rights to use and occupy the land. When the term of the Lease ends, the land reverts to the lessor.\nf) Description of basic functions of the registration system\n1. to give notice to the public of all documents registered concerning a particular piece of reserve land.\n2. to show the historical record of registered interests.\n3. to display interests that affect reserve land.\ng) The Manual sets out the administrative \u201c...procedures for preparing, submitting and registering documents for the ILRS, in accordance with policy requirements developed in support of the Indian Act land management provisions.\u201d It provides guidance as to, inter alia, how to prepare documents for registration, what documents are required, as well as the requirements for registration applications and their content.\nh) The Manual describes what an \u201cinterest\u201d in land is and the requirements for a \u201clegal document\u201d as follows:\nIn the normal course of management of reserve lands, a variety of transactions may affect the rights or interest in the land. The transactions may involve a First Nation, one or more members of a Band, or non-members of a Band. The transactions are described in an \u201cinstrument\u201d, a legal document that gives effect to the transaction, and describes the parcel of land, the parties to the transaction, and any legal details and specifications required.\ni) The Manual includes direction on when to refuse the registration of documents submitted including where \u201cthe interest granted by the instrument overlaps or is inconsistent with a previously registered interest\u201d which can include a situation where the \u201cinstrument purports to grant a leasehold interest and the instrument is not the proper authority as specified in the Indian Act.\u201d\nj) The Manual provides that the lessor in a locatee lease must be the Crown.\n[30] Ms. Craig\u2019s uncontradicted oral evidence at the hearing amplifies many of the foregoing facts regarding the ILRS as she testified that:\n- The Manual is a document which describes the procedures for preparing, submitting and registering documents in the ILRS. The procedures are designed to govern the registration of rights of interest, claims of interest, or notices of claims of interest in reserve land;\n- The Manual provides that the basic functions of the ILRS are to give notice to the public of all documents registered concerning a particular piece of reserve land; show a historical record of registered interests; and display interests that affect reserve land;\n- The key purposes of the ILRS are to fulfil the statutory requirements of the Act, safeguard registered interests, and provide timely and reliable information to the public, bands and others;\n- Documents proposed for registration must first be reviewed and verified to ensure that they meet the requirements set out in the Manual, the Act, legal advice, court cases and other relevant policy. Once the documents are reviewed and verified the officer enters the information respecting the documents into the ILRS in accordance with Indian Land Registry Entry Guidelines (the Guidelines);\n- A document may be registered if it grants or claims an interest in reserve land; transfers, encumbers, or affects reserve land, designated, or surrendered land; and is submitted to the ILRS in accordance with the Act and the Manual;\n- An applicant for registration or his agent submits the following documents to the applicable Regional office of the Respondent:\na. The instrument (details for preparation in Chapter 3 of the Manual);\nb. An affidavit of witness (details for preparation in Chapter 4 of the Manual);\nc. An application for registration (details for preparation in Chapter 5 of the Manual);\nd. The legal land description (details for preparation in Chapter 6 of the Manual); and\ne. All other supporting documents (details for most common documents in Chapter 7 of the Manual).\n- In order for a document to be registered it must fulfill certain technical criteria set out in the Manual (such as being properly executed, identifying the parties and identifying the nature of the interest to be registered) and, in the case of instruments such as leases or permits, Ministerial approval or consent (Minister of the Respondent on behalf of Her Majesty) is required.\n- Once a document is submitted for registration, the Registrar (i.e. the Regional office)\na. assigns a registration number, which is used throughout the process and records the year, month and hour of the registration in the ILRS;\nb. determines if the document is not acceptable for registration following the criteria listed in section 9 of the Manual. If it is not acceptable for registration, the Region will return the instrument, the application and all supporting documents submitted with the instrument;\nc. verifies that the necessary documents have been submitted;\nd. verifies that the instrument meets the criteria set out in section 8.4 of the Manual including, under section 8.4.1(10), that it is signed by the person with the proper delegated authority;\ne. in the case of a locatee, ensures that the locatee specific criteria set out in section 8.4.5 of the Manual are met; and\nf. in the case of a lease, ensures that the lease specific criteria set out in section 8.4.7 of the Manual are met.\n- Chapter 9 of the Manual provides guidance to registry staff regarding criteria to refuse registration. It provides that where, in the opinion of the lands officer reviewing the application and related material, identified criteria are not met, the regional office shall not register an instrument. For the purposes of this case, the key grounds to reject an application are: where the instrument being registered does not meet the requirements set out in the Manual and where Ministerial approval is not provided. These requirements were present in both the former and current version of the Manual.\n- the ILRS is a document repository. It does not guarantee title or accuracy of the documents filed in the registry. Registration does not give priority to one registered interest over another (other than in cases involving assignments of interest).\n- if a locatee wishes to lease his or her possessory title it can be done pursuant to the 2013 Locatee Lease Policy. Pursuant to that policy, locatees can request that the Minister of the Respondent enter into a section 58(3) of the Act lease to a range of persons including corporations, other Indians or the locatee him or herself and such a leasehold interest can then be mortgaged to provide financing for development of the land.\n- the Respondent has fulfilled the statutory requirements of section 21 of the Act by creating the ILRS and setting up a process for entering particulars relating to allocations of lawful possession and other transactions relating to reserve land. In the case of an allocation of reserve land, the Respondent records the band council resolution allocating lawful possession to a band member, which has the effect of creating a folio for that interest. Subsequent transactions relating to that interest, such as a section 58(3) lease of the interest, are registered in the same folio. On page 34 of the Indian Land Registry Line Entry Guidelines, departmental officials are directed to register the band council resolution allotting the land and state that ministerial consent is required before such an interest is registered. Page 43 of the Guidelines lists the four types of leases that are registered in the Indian Land Registry which are Section 53(1) leases of designated land, 58(1)(b) locatee leases of agricultural land, 58(1)(c) band leases of agricultural land and 58(3) locatee leases for non-agricultural purposes.\nIV. Threshold\/Preliminary Issue: Are the Complaints solely a challenge to or a collateral attack upon legislation and nothing else and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as per the Murphy, Matson and Andrews line of cases?\n[31] Both parties in their submissions at the hearing identified this as either a \u201cthreshold\u201d issue (the Complainants\u2019 description) or a \u201cpreliminary\u201d issue (the Respondent\u2019s description). I agree.\n[32] Murphy (Murphy v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 9) is a case that involved a Complaint under the CHRA concerning the manner that certain tax relief calculations of lump sum payments for retroactive pay to a group of women in a pay equity situation were done by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) under the Income Tax Act (ITA). Former Vice-Chair of the Tribunal Hadjis held that the Complaint was not substantiated. At paragraphs 57 and 58 of his decision he wrote as follows:\n[57] In sum, the source of the alleged discriminatory practice is not, in whole or in part, the CRA\u2019s activities, be they a service customarily available to the public or not, but rather exclusively the tax legislation itself. In Wignall v. Canada (Department of National Revenue (Taxation), 2003 FC 1280, at para. 30, the Federal Court noted that the conduct of Revenue Canada cannot be held to be discriminatory under the CHRA when what is really being impugned is a provision of the ITA.\n[58] Accordingly, where the alleged discrimination, as in the present case, arises solely from the legislative language of the ITA and not the activities of the CRA, it is not as a result of the provision of services by the CRA, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA. Consequently, a prima facie case pursuant to that section cannot be substantiated.\n[33] The Federal Court dismissed an application for judicial review of the Murphy decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency 2011 FC 207 and the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Federal Court at 2012 FCA 7. A subsequent application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed (34706). In upholding the decision of the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 6 as follows:\n[6] This is a direct attack on sections 110.2 and 120.31 of the ITA, based on considerations that are wholly extrinsic to the ITA. As was held in Forward v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 at paragraphs 37 and 38 with respect to an identical challenge directed at specified provisions of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, this type of attack falls outside the scope of the CHRA since it is aimed at the legislation per se, and nothing else. Along the same lines, the Federal Court in Wignall v. Canada (Department of National Revenue (Taxation)), 2003 FC 1280, observed in obiter that an attempt pursuant to the CHRA to counter the application of paragraph 56(1)(n) of the ITA based solely on its alleged discriminatory impact on the complainant, could not succeed; only a constitutional challenge could yield this result. In our view, the opinion expressed in these cases is the correct one since the CHRA does not provide for the filing of a complaint directed against an act of Parliament (see subsection 40(1) which authorizes the filing of complaints and sections 5 to 14.1 which sets out the \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d against which complaints may be directed).\n[34] Matson (Matson et al v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada 2013 CHRT 13) was decided by me. Andrews (Andrews et al v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada 2013 CHRT 21) was decided by Member Marchildon. Both of these cases involved Complaints under the CHRA concerning the registration of Indian status under section 6 of the Act. Both Member Marchildon and I dismissed the Complaints. Both of our decisions followed the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Murphy in finding that the Complaints were solely a challenge to legislation, namely section 6 of the Act, and nothing else.\n[35] In Matson I wrote the following at paragraphs 57 to 60 inclusive:\n[57] As the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d and subsection 5(5) of the Indian Act indicate, entitlement and registration are two separate things. Entitlement is predetermined by the Indian Act, regardless of registration; whereas registration in the Indian Register is the result of an application process through the Registrar\/Department.\n[58] The Respondent does not offer to the public the benefit of entitlement to registration under section 6 of the Indian Act, or the corresponding tangible and intangible benefits that may go along with entitlement to registration. It is the Indian Act itself that offers the benefit of entitlement to registration and it is Parliament who has applied the entitlement provisions of the Indian Act to the public, not the Respondent. What the Respondent may offer as a benefit\/service to the public is the processing of applications for registration to determine whether a person should be added to the Indian Register, in accordance with the Indian Act. This involves the Indian Registrar receiving applications for registration, reviewing the information in the application to determine whether it is complete and accurate; and, assessing the application to determine whether or not the applicant satisfies the entitlement provisions of section 6 of the Indian Act. The Complainants do not allege discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s performance of any of these functions. As noted, the result of this process is that either the applicant is added to the Indian Register as being entitled to status as an Indian under the Indian Act or he is not. While the processing of an application by the Registrar as described above may be a service, the resulting status or lack thereof is not.\n[59] As is clear from the Complainants\u2019 submissions, it is not the Respondent\u2019s processing of the Complainants\u2019 applications that is being challenged in this case. Rather, it is the Complainants\u2019 entitlement to registration, pursuant to section 6 of the Indian Act, which gives rise to the present complaint. The sole source of the alleged discrimination in this case is the legislative language of section 6 of the Indian Act. In reviewing the Complainants\u2019 applications for registration, the Respondent\u2019s officials did nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Any issue taken with the application review process is really an issue taken with section 6 of the Indian Act.\n[60] Therefore, for the above reasons, I would answer the first question in the affirmative and find the present complaint to be a challenge to legislation, namely section 6 of the Indian Act, and nothing else.\n[36] In Andrews Member Marchildon wrote the following at paragraphs 110 and 111:\n[110] Although this reasoning does not lead to a decision in the Complainant\u2019s favour, I do not wish to diminish the suffering that Mr. Andrews and his family state to have endured as a result of the government\u2019s enfranchisement policies. While the Complainants cannot challenge the impugned sections of the Indian Act pursuant to the Act, they may still choose to do so pursuant to the Charter as per Murphy. This was done successfully in the McIvor case, for example, for sections 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act. The Tribunal is not, however, the appropriate forum to hear this challenge in this case.\n[111] I would therefore answer questions A. and B. in the following manner:\nA. Do the complaints involve the provision of services customarily available to the general public within the meaning of section 5 of the Act; or, are the complaints solely a challenge to legislation?\nAnswer: The complaints are solely a challenge to legislation.\nB. If the complaints are solely a challenge to legislation, does the Act allow for such complaints?\nAnswer: No.\nIn light of these answers, I do not need to address questions C. and D., namely\nC. Has the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination? and\nD. If so, has the Respondent demonstrated that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act?\n[37] These two decisions were judicially reviewed together by the Federal Court in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FC 398. In dismissing the application for judicial review the Federal Court held at paragraph 59 to 62 inclusive as follows:\n[59] A challenge to the way in which that formula is applied is a challenge to the law itself. In the present case, the Complainants are alleging the eligibility provisions of the Indian Act are discriminatory. Therefore, applying the mandatory eligibility provisions of the Indian Act is an act of enforcing the law, even though the statute provides a benefit. It is the law which denies access to the benefit, not the government agency.\n[60] In my opinion, the findings from Forward are equally applicable to the present case. At paragraph 54, referring to Forward, the Tribunal found that citizenship under the Citizenship Act was not a service, because the sole source of the alleged discrimination is the legislative language of the Citizenship Act. Forward adopted the obiter from McKenna which said that Druken was wrongly decided (Forward, at paras 32-34).\n[61] Moreover, the fact that Matson and Andrews are analogous to Murphy is supported by the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal in Murphy specifically addressed Druken. I think it is clear that the Federal Court of Appeal intended its conclusions to apply to cases of the government applying the mandatory provisions of a statute, particularly when reading the Court\u2019s comments in paragraph 7, as described above. The circumstances of Matson and Andrews are arguably analogous to those in Murphy. In both instances, the legislature set out a mandatory scheme or formula which a government organization applies without discretion.\n[62] I think the detailed analysis of the Tribunal is reasonable and I find that the Tribunal\u2019s reliance on Murphy was reasonable. Murphy was a decision by a higher court that legislation was not a \u201cservice\u201d as defined in section 5. The interpretation of section 5 from Murphy was consistent with the language of section 5 of the Indian Act. Further, Murphy also addressed the conflicting jurisprudence from Druken.\n[38] Prior to the hearing in this case, Mr. Beattie brought a motion to strike out parts of the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars which invoked the application of the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle to the present complaint. In my ruling on the motion (Beattie v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada 2015 CHRT 16), I summarized the parties\u2019 positions on this issue (which were largely repeated in their arguments at the hearing), as per the written materials filed on the motion, at paragraphs 10 and 11, as follows:\n[10] The submissions on the motion by both the Complainant and the Respondent centre on the principle enunciated in Murphy, Matson and Andrews that legislation cannot be directly challenged pursuant to the CHRA. According to the Complainant, section 21 of the Act is a service customarily available to the general public to be provided in a non-discriminatory manner mandating the registration of documents covering land transactions between registered Indians of reserve land, without reference to other conditions or provisions of the Act. The Complainant argues that on a plain and ordinary reading of the words in section 21, the Indian Land Registrar was mandated to register the documents submitted to it in this case, without any reference to whether the transactions described in the documents were \"legally valid\" by virtue of other sections of the Act as interpreted by the Respondent that are not mentioned in section 21. For the Complainant, the engagement by the Respondent of the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle as a defence to the Complaints is irrelevant and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as his case represents the enforcement of, not a challenge to, mandatory legislation - namely section 21. Hence, the Complainant requests the Tribunal to strike from the Respondent's Statement of Particulars the paragraphs that he says refer to this principle.\n[11] According to the Respondent, section 21 of the Act is part of a statutory scheme that cannot be read alone without engaging other sections of the Act. Reading this section together with the other sections of the Act, including subsection 58(3), informs the proper interpretation of section 21. The service offered to the public is really the entire registration process which includes the step of registration detailed at section 21. The service is not limited to the step of registration alone. The Respondent argues that this process is provided for by mandatory legislation that the Registrar of Indian Lands cannot ignore. By registering documents pursuant to section 21 that are rendered invalid by other sections of the Act, the Registrar would act in violation of the legislation. As such, the Respondent takes the position that the Complaints seek to challenge mandatory legislation and nothing else, thereby invoking the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle that is a legitimate and key defence to the Complaints. The Respondent\u2019s position that it is erroneous to interpret section 21 in the absence of other provisions of the Indian Act does not constitute a challenge to legislation and the Respondent submits that, contrary to the Complainant\u2019s argument, the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle does not apply in this regard. The Respondent further submits that pursuant to the principle, if the Complainant wants to challenge the legislative process, on the basis that is discriminatory, he must do so in a court as a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge, as the current legislation is mandatory and can only be changed by an amendment of the legislation, not by a decision of the Tribunal.\n[39] I dismissed the motion on the basis that it was premature at that time to determine the issue and grant the relief requested by Mr. Beattie at paragraph 17, as follows:\n[17] It is clear that the Complainant and the Respondent take completely opposite positions in their submissions on this motion about a fundamental issue. The fact that both parties have argued the merits of this issue rather than the motion to strike, supports the need for oral argument on this point. I am not persuaded by the Complainant that it would be fair, on a preliminary basis, in the absence of a hearing, to strike the paragraphs requested in the motion from the Respondent's Statement of Particulars, as they constitute a primary defence in this case worthy of being heard. To do so, in my view, would deprive the Respondent of its right to a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make legal representations on the matters raised in the Complaint.\n[40] As a result of the evidence adduced at the hearing, much of which is referred to in Part III of this decision above, and the oral arguments presented on this issue at the hearing, which were essentially the same as on the motion to strike, I am now able to determine this issue on the merits.\nV. Analysis\n[41] The highly credible evidence of Ms. Craig, referred to in Part III of this decision above, was not contradicted or impugned in any material way during the hearing. In sum, she provided a description of a legislative scheme of interrelated and interconnected rules that form a process or system for land management under the Act, of which registration is a part. That system requires the Crown, as owner\/landlord, to be a party to leases of the subject lands, in order for the Registrar, without discretion, to be allowed to register (enter) them as Ministerial leases (not private leases) under section 21 of the Act.\n[42] The legislative scheme of the Act, by virtue of sections 2(1) and 18(1), currently vests the subject lands and the title thereto (which are within an Indian reserve still administered by Canada under the Act) in the Crown for the use and benefit of the Indian band for whom it has been set aside (the Okanagan Indian Band), as determined by the Governor in Council.\n[43] Section 20 the Act provides for the council of a band, with the Minister\u2019s approval, to allot lawful possession of its reserve land to a member of the band through the issuance of a Certificate of Possession (CP). However, a CP does not confer ownership as it is not an instrument of conveyance (Tyendinaga Mohawk Council v. Brant, 2014 ONCA 565 at paras 21 and 80-84). This is the interest that Mr. Louie has had in the subject lands and CPs covering this right in the subject lands which were registered in his name in the Register.\n[44] Section 24 of the Act only allows a transfer by a person in lawful possession of lands in a reserve of the right of possession to the lands to the band or another band member and then only with the approval of the Minister.\n[45] Section 28(1) of the Act deems void a lease by a band member of reserve lands to any person other than a member of that band subject to subsection 2. Section 28(2) authorizes the Minister in writing to authorize any person for a period not exceeding one year, or with the consent of the council of the band for any longer period, to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise rights on a reserve.\n[46] Section 58(3) of the Act provides that the Minister may lease, for the benefit of any Indian, on application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession of.\n[47] Section 21 of the Act requires the Respondent to keep in the Register in which shall be entered (registered) the particulars of CPs and Certificates of Occupation and other transactions respecting lands in a reserve.\n[48] The Respondent argues that in accordance with the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Celgene Corp v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 1 (Celgene), at paragraph 21, statutory interpretation involves a consideration of the ordinary meaning of words used and the statutory context in which they are found. As such, the Respondent argues that the context of sections 20 and 24 inform the correct interpretation of section 58(3) of the Act that \u201cthe Minister may lease\u201d requires that the Minister must be the designated lessor. If not, it is contended by the Respondent, the purpose of sections 24 and 28(1) is redundant. This statutory requirement is reflected in section 10.1.12 of the Manual, which expressly provides that the lessor must be Crown Canada.\n[49] Further, the Respondent argues, again citing Celgene, that in the absence of case law on section 21 of the Act, but based on its language and its statutory context, \u201cother transactions\u201d would include section 58(3) leases.\n[50] Mr. Beattie\u2019s evidence at the hearing did not contradict Ms. Craig\u2019s evidence as to how the ILRS, the Manual and the Act interact and are connected with each other. His evidence and arguments are largely based on his views 1) that the Act itself is currently anachronistic, paternalistic and discriminatory towards Indians in many respects; and 2) that the Crown is not really the owner of the subject lands but that Mr. Louie was the owner and his estate now is; and 3) that under section 21 of the Act, the Registrar is mandated, because of the word \u201cshall\u201d therein and because there is no reference to other sections, to register all leases, including private leases, without regard to the other sections of the Act, that provide for the Crown to be the owner of the subject lands and require the Minister to participate in the leases; and 4) that in refusing to register the private leases (which are also referred to commonly as \u201cbuckshee\u201d leases), between registered Indians under the Act, but without the Crown\u2019s participation, the Respondent contravened section 5 of the CHRA by denying the Complainants a service (i.e. registration of documents) customarily available to the public.\n[51] I accept the evidence of Ms. Craig as referred to in paragraph 40 and the Respondent\u2019s arguments on this issue as described in paragraphs 38, 48 and 49 herein. In my opinion, contrary to Mr. Beattie\u2019s arguments, section 21 of the Act, which is at the heart of this issue, does not stand in isolation; rather it is part of an interconnected and interrelated set of provisions. The proper interpretation of section 21 is that it is part of a legislative scheme and is informed by reading it with other sections including section 58(3) mandating that as the Crown is the owner of the lands, the Minister, in Her Right, must be the lessor of locatee leases.\n[52] In interpreting legislation like section 21, it is necessary to analyse the scheme of an Act. As set out by R. Sullivan, in Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, (6th ed. 2014), at paragraph 13.12;\nWhen analyzing the scheme of an Act, the court tries to discover how the provisions or parts of the Act work together to give effect to a plausible and coherent plan. It then considers how the provision to be interpreted can be understood in terms of that plan. The court\u2019s reasoning is described by Greschuk J. in Melnychuk v. Heard:\nThe court must not only consider one section but all sections of an Act including the relation of one section to the other sections, the relation of a section to the general object intended to be secured by the Act, the importance of the section, the whole scope of the Act and the real intention of the enacting body.\u201d\nThe excerpt from Melnychuk was endorsed by the Federal Court in De Silva v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 790, at para. 42.\n[53] It does not seem to me that the intention of Parliament under the Act and the ILRS was to provide, on the one hand, for the Crown to own the lands in question and to require the Minister to consent to any leases thereof by virtue of the sections of the Act referred to in paragraphs 42 to 46 herein and the Manual while, on the other hand, to allow the Registrar to register leases under section 21 that do not comply with these requirements. Not only would that not be a plausible and coherent plan but it would also be contrary to the public interest in terms of properly informing and not misleading members of the public who wish to use the Register for its efficacy.\n[54] The words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cother documents\u201d as used in section 21 of the Act must be read in the context of the whole land management scheme as being informed by the other sections thereof referred to above. In my opinion, therefore, section 21 of the Act mandates the Registrar, without discretion, to refuse to register the private leases and assignment in this case as invalid documents within the legislative land management scheme of the Act. His refusal to register the private leases and assignment in this case is therefore not a violation of section 5 of the CHRA. While the whole process of reviewing and eventually registering valid documents or not registering invalid documents may be a service, the legislative criteria for doing so is not. It is the mandatory land management scheme of the Act that is being challenged in the present Complaints and not a service provided by the Respondent.\n[55] For the foregoing reasons, I am obliged to follow the reasons in the Murhpy, Matson and Andrews line of cases and find that the Complaints in this case are solely a challenge to or a collateral attack upon legislation and nothing else and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n[56] As noted above in paragraph 50, Mr. Beattie, in my opinion, is essentially challenging legislation (the Act) that he views, in many respects as anachronistic, paternalistic and discriminatory towards Indians. His view in this regard may very well accord with the view that First Nations people ought to be treated on a nation to nation basis with Canada instead of as its ward in a system of land management that renders First Nations subordinate rather than equal. To change this relationship will require a change in the policies of the Government of Canada and the legislation. Alternatively, Mr. Beattie can try to challenge the legislation in a Court under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nVI.

Background\n[1] On June 3, 2011, the Complainant filed a complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against the then Department of Fisheries and Oceans (now Fisheries and Oceans Canada) (\u201dDFO\u201d). The Complainant alleges that DFO discriminated against him by failing and\/or refusing to accommodate his disability, treating him in an adverse, differential manner by engaging in a discriminatory policy or practice, thereby denying him an employment opportunity, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cHuman Rights Act\u201d). The Complaint was amended so that the Respondent became \u201cThe Attorney General of Canada, representing DFO and the Public Service Commission of Canada\u201d (\u201cPSC\u201d) (collectively, \u201cRespondent\u201d).\n[2] There is a confidentiality order governing this inquiry.\n[3] Each party filed a Statement of Particulars (SOP). The Commission is not participating in the hearing.\n[4] The Complainant brought a motion seeking further documentary disclosure from the Respondent (Disclosure Motion). Ruling 2015 CHRT 13, issued May 29, 2015 (May 29 Ruling) decided the Disclosure Motion.\n[5] The May 29 Ruling ordered the Respondent to disclose almost all of the documents in Table 2 in the Complainant\u2019s notice of motion, but declined to order disclosure of documents in Table 1 thereof (Table 1 Documents), on the basis that this request for disclosure was not related to any fact, issue, or form of relief in one of the SOPs.\n[6] In his Disclosure Motion, the Complainant also requested documents which he stated were arguably relevant to his allegation of harassment. The Respondent submitted that harassment within the meaning of the Act was not within the scope of the Complaint.\n[7] The May 29 Ruling found that:\nalthough the Complainant cited subsection 14(1)(c) and section 59 of the Actin his SOP, the Tribunal has jurisdiction only over subsection 14(1)(c);\nbecause the Respondent\u2019s position was that subsection 14(1)(c) harassment was not within the scope of the Complaint, it was in the parties\u2019 best interests to know whether the Complaint included harassment;\nthe Tribunal had to decide the issue of the scope of the Complaint before it could rule on the Complainant\u2019s request for disclosure of documents related to harassment.\n[8] Therefore, the May 29 Ruling invited submissions from the parties on:\nwhether the Complaint includes an allegation of harassment within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) (harassment allegation); and,\nif any party thought that it did not, their positions on amending the Complaint to include the harassment allegation.\n[9] The May 29 Ruling further stated at para. 34 regarding disclosure of the Table 1 Documents, that:\n\u201cIf the Complainant is able to formulate a more specific request that clearly demonstrates why the disclosure he has received thus far is inadequate and how any further disclosure request complies with Rule 6, then, after submissions from the other parties, the Tribunal would assess and decide on the request.\u201d\n[10] The Complainant has filed his Submission (Complainant\u2019s Submission) and reply (Reply) to the Respondent\u2019s response to his Submission (Response). The Commission has not filed any submissions.\nII. Issues\nDoes the Complaint include harassment within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act?\nIf any party\u2019s position is that the Complaint does not include harassment, should the Tribunal amend the Complaint to include it?\nIs the Complainant entitled to disclosure of the Table 1 Documents, as requested in his Submission?\nA. Does the Complaint include harassment within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act?\nB. If not, should the Tribunal amend the Complaint to include it?\n[11] Subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act states:\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice, (c) in matters related to employment, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d\n1. Complainant\u2019s Position re Harassment and Amendment\n[12] The Complainant submits that he has already included harassment in the Complaint (which he also calls the \u201cComplaint Form\u201d), because the Complaint:\n\u201camply\u201d alleges harassment with \u201clinkages to disability\u201d, so that subsection 14(1)(c) applies;\nwhen the Commission was deciding whether to refer the Complaint to the Tribunal Chair for an inquiry, the documents it reviewed included the Complaint, the Commission\u2019s Investigative Report (IR), and the Complainant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s responses to the IR;\nthe Commission\u2019s July 31, 2012 referral letter to the Tribunal Chair requesting that the Tribunal initiate an inquiry (Referral Letter) was attached to the Complaint and did not limit the allegations the Tribunal was to inquire into;\nin accordance with Kanagasabapathy v. Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7 (Kanagasabapathy), it is the Referral Letter which decides the scope of the Complaint (Kanagasabapathy, at paras. 29 to 38);\nthe fact that the Commission\u2019s Summary of Complaint form did not contain a reference to subsection 14(1)(c) is irrelevant, because the Summary of Complaint form is not a part of the Complaint itself, but is merely an administrative attachment which the Commission drafts, used for internal Commission purpose;\nthe Complainant had no input into the Summary of Complaint form;\nthe Summary of Complaint form has no legal status and does not limit the allegations in the Complaint;\nparagraphs 2 and 69 to 76 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP refer to and specifically address the allegation of the Respondent\u2019s section 14-related harassment of the Complainant;\nalthough paragraphs 8, 10 and 11 of the Complaint do not contain specific mention of section 14 of the Act, there is no requirement for a Complaint to cite specific sections of the Act;\nsubsection 14(1)(c) does not constitute a new complaint, because the Respondent has known since the Complainant sent the emails attached as Exhibit A to his Reply (Complainant\u2019s Email Chain) \u2013 that is, since 2010 \u2013 that the Complainant has been alleging that the Respondent harassed him, and that the harassment was \u201cdirectly related to\u201d the Complainant\u2019s disability;\nthere is therefore no prejudice to the Respondent, because of its above knowledge regarding harassment.\n[13] The Complainant opposes amending the Complaint to include harassment; he submits it is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that the Complaint as it stands alleges harassment.\n[14] Alternatively, the Complainant submits that if the Tribunal decides that the Complaint needs to be amended, there are cases which support the Tribunal\u2019s authority to amend a complaint \u2013 for example, Carol Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, Ruling No. 1, (CHRT) April 22, 2002 (Cook v. Onion Lake).\n[15] An amendment to include harassment would not alter the scope of the Complaint, nor would it amount to a new complaint, because the Complaint already contains the allegation of harassment.\n2. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[16] The Respondent\u2019s position is that harassment is not within the scope of the Complaint. The Tribunal should not grant the request for an amendment to add harassment within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) to the Complaint, for the following reasons:\na. Jurisdiction\nthe wording of subsections 44(1) and 44(3)(a) of the Act mean that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a complaint \u201cflows directly from the Commission\u2019s investigation and subsequent referral of that complaint\u201d;\nin this Complaint, the Commission did not complete an investigation into harassment, and refused to do so, as clearly shown by attached emails between the Commission and the Complainant;\ntherefore, the harassment allegation could not have been part of the Complaint which the Commission referred to the Tribunal.\nit follows that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to hear the issue and would exceed its jurisdiction if it amended the Complaint to include harassment.\nb. Other Factors\nThe Complainant did not request a remedy for harassment \u2013 all the remediesthe Complainant seeks are related to his allegation of failure to accommodate him in the appointment process \u2013 therefore, harassment could not have been included in the Complaint;\nit is irrelevant that the Complainant\u2019s SOP referred to the Act\u2019s harassment sections \u2013 the Complaint never did;\nthe conduct alleged by the Complainant as constituting harassment was not on a prohibited ground of discrimination, but rather in response to his \u201crepetitive and insistent requests\u201d; This conduct \u201crelates to a workplace dispute between the Complainant and Mr. Gardiner\u201d;\nnothing in the Complaint connects Mr. Gardiner\u2019s actions to a prohibited ground of discrimination, including by the Complainant himself;\nthe Commission did not address any harassment allegation in its SOP, which fact is \u201canother indication that it was obviously not part of the Complaint\u201d.\nc. Summary of Complaint form\nneither the Commission\u2019s original Summary of Complaint Form nor the amended version cite subsection 14(1)(c) or section 59 harassment;\nthe Summary of Complaint form attached to the Referral Letter was amended to remove section 10 as a ground and again did not mention subsection 14(1)(c).\nd. Prejudice\nAccording to the Federal Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (Parent) at para.40, the most important factor a tribunal must consider when deciding whether to grant an amendment is whether granting it will prejudice an opposite party;\nthe Respondent will be prejudiced because harassment would constitute a substantially new complaint, contrary to the criteria in Cook v. Onion Lake (supra), Gaucherv. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 (Gaucher) and Canderel Ltd. v. Canada(1994) 1 FC 3 (FCA) (Canderel);\nthe Complainant\u2019s harassment allegations are new and \u201care of such a different nature that particulars will not be sufficient to allow the Respondent to defend itself\u201d;\nat this late stage of the Complaint process, it would prejudice the Respondent\u2019s right to procedural fairness, specifically, the \u201cright to be given a fair opportunity to defend itself against\u201d the harassment allegation, contrary to Cook v. Onion Lake, Gaucher and Canderel;\nthe passage of time also prejudices the Respondent \u2013 for example, the DFO no longer employs the former Deputy General, Major Crown Projects (DGMCP), Mr. Gardiner;\nthe Complainant\u2019s SOP is not sufficiently particular with respect to any alleged harassment for the Respondent to know the case to be met, including the fact that there is \u201cno indication of the prohibited ground on which the allegation of harassment is based\u201d.\n3. Legislation, case law re scope of a complaint and amendment of a complaint\n[17] Subsection 43(1) of the Act states:\n\u201cThe Commission may designate a person, in this Part referred to as an \u201cinvestigator\u201d, to investigate a complaint.\n[18] Subsection 44(1) of the Act states:\n\u201cAn investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation, submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation.\u201d\n[19] Subsection 44(3)(a) of the Act states:\n\u201cOn receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission\n(a) may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry under section 49 into the complaint to which the report relates if the Commission is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and ....\n(ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subsection (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e);\u201d\n[20] Subsection 49(1) of the Act states:\n\u201cAt any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[21] Parent (supra) is the Federal Court\u2019s latest guidance on amendments. The initial complaint and the requested amendment must have a common thread or a common factor underpinning them both (Parent, (supra), at para. 43).\n[22] The proposed amendment cannot constitute a new and different complaint (Canderel, supra).\n[23] Further, in deciding whether to grant an amendment, the Tribunal does not enter into an examination of the merits of the proposed amendment (Stacey Lee Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 1013 CHRT 9 (Tabor) at para. 4).\n[24] Notwithstanding any other factors which may support doing so, the Tribunal cannot grant an amendment if it would result in prejudice to another party to the complaint (Parent, supra, at para. 40), (Cook v. Onion Lake, supra, cited in Museum of Civilization Corp. v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, Local 70396 (2006) F.C. 704 (Museum of Civilization), at para. 28. The prejudice must be actual prejudice, which impacts on the fairness of the hearing (Cook v. Onion Lake, supra, at para.20).\n4. Analysis re Harassment and Amendment\na. Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\n[25] The Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to initiate an inquiry into a complaint flows directly from the IR and the Commission\u2019s subsequent referral of the complaint to the Tribunal. Therefore, because the Commission did not investigate harassment, its referral of this Complaint to the Tribunal Chair could not have included harassment. In analyzing this submission, I take into account the factors below.\n[26] Subsection 43(1) of the Act gives the Commission the option of not [my italics] designating an investigator, by using the word \u201cmay\u201d, rather than the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d. Therefore, the Commission may refer a complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry without any investigation at all. Subsection 49(1) confirms this. It authorizes the Commission to request the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry \u201c[A]t any stage after the filing of a complaint\u201d, if the Commission is \u201csatisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[27] Subsection 44(3)(a) of the Act does not say, nor has it been construed to say, that if an IR recommends that a complaint be referred to the Tribunal Chairperson for an inquiry, the Commission is obligated to do so. The subsection also does not say, nor has it been construed to say, that if an IR recommends that the Commission dismiss a complaint or recommends against referring the complaint to the Tribunal, the Commission is obligated to do so.\n[28] Further, subsection 44(3)(a) cannot be read and interpreted in isolation.\n[29] Subsection 44(3)(a) also directs the Commission to be \u201csatisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted\u201d. The IR is one of the documents the Commission examines in coming to its decision, but only if it has ordered an investigation. Even if there has been an investigation, this subsection of the Act mandates that the Commission must still have regard to \u201call the circumstances of the complaint\u201d in deciding if a Tribunal inquiry is \u201cwarranted\u201d.\n[30] Therefore, the prerequisites for the Commission to decide whether to refer a complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry are first, the complaint must have been filed with the Commission, and second, the Commission must be \u201csatisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[31] To summarize, then, subsections 43(1) and 49(1) of the Act work together to authorize the Commission to refer a complaint to the Tribunal Chairperson without the necessity of an investigation or the resulting IR. The Commission may refer a complaint to the Tribunal \u201cAt any stage\u201d after a complainant files it with the Commission.\n[32] I have briefly read the series of emails the Respondent attached to its Response as Tabs 118 and 120 (Respondent\u2019s Email Chain). I have also briefly read the series of emails the Complainant attached as Exhibit A to his Reply (Complainant\u2019s Email Chain).\n[33] At this stage of the inquiry, neither the Respondent\u2019s nor the Complainant\u2019s Email Chains are admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents, but are merely referred to as evidence that the emails within them were sent on the dates shown.\n[34] In this Complaint, the IR recommended against referral to the Tribunal \u2013 rather, it recommended the Complaint be dismissed. The Commission nevertheless referred the Complaint to the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry. The Commission must have been \u201csatisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances\u201d of this Complaint, that an inquiry into this Complaint was \u201cwarranted\u201d.\n[35] Therefore, I conclude that the fact that the Commission\u2019s investigation did not include harassment under the Act is not determinative of the scope of the Complaint. That is particularly so because in this Complaint, the Commission overrode the IR\u2019s recommendation in any event.\n[36] Further, a Tribunal inquiry is akin to a trial de novo - a \u201ctrial from the beginning\u201d. The Tribunal takes a fresh look \u2013 from the beginning \u2013 at the complaint and all the admissible evidence. The Tribunal is not bound by the IR or by the Commission\u2019s findings, as was held, for example, by the Federal Court in Gravel v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FC 832, at para 50.\n[37] To determine the scope of this Complaint, I also take into account other factors, as set out below.\nb. The Complaint, the Summary of Complaint form and the Referral Letter\n[38] I note the following paragraphs of the Complaint, using its numbering:\n\u201c8. My email then precipitated a lengthy exchange of emails with DGMCP (Mike Gardiner) in which he badgered me regarding my involving senior leadership in the accommodation request issue. He also exerted excessive and unwarranted managerial pressure for me to meet with him to discuss my accommodation request. I told him that my mental health would be adversely affected by continuing to discuss it. DGMCP continued to push me hard, questioned the veracity of my disability and threatened (actually promised) disciplinary action if I continued to refuse to meet with him. Eventually, his confrontational, aggressive and bullying methods caused me tremendous mental stress and I approached my previously established breaking point. I simply could not endure any more of his unrelenting, abusive, authoritative bullying. Therefore I informed [Commissioner Da Pont] that he needed DGMCP to stop acting on his behalf and to cease his harassment of me. \u2026\n10. \u2026DFO tolerated and encouraged the bullying of me by DGMCP and otherwise intentionally and actively discriminated against me\u2026\u201d\n[39] The Tribunal should keep in mind the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s statement in Canada (Attorney General) v. Robinson, [1994] 3 FCR 228, that \u201cComplaint forms are not to be perused in the same manner as criminal indictments\u201d. Although the Complaint does not specifically cite any harassment sections of the Act, I find that it does allege a course of behaviour which the Complainant calls harassment, and which, in the Complainant\u2019s view, is part of the circumstances of his Complaint.\n[40] The Respondent submits that because both the Commission\u2019s original Summary of Complaint form and the revised version make no mention of harassment, it follows that harassment was not included in the scope of the Complaint which the Commission referred to the Tribunal Chair.\n[41] The Complainant submits that the Summary of Complaint form is simply an administrative document and the fact that its two iterations do not state harassment is irrelevant, and has no legal effect.\n[42] I have looked into whether any other Tribunal cases dealt with the significance or weight to be accorded to the Summary of Complaint form, and found two such cases.\n[43] In Valerie Deschambeault v. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 CHRT 48 (Deschambeault), the Tribunal noted that the unrepresented complainant had not specified in her complaint \u201cwhich provision of the Act\u201d she alleged was violated (at para 1). The Tribunal used the Summary of Complaint form the Commission attached to her complaint, which cited section 7 under \u201capplicable section\u201d, and \u201cnational or ethnic origin\u201d under \u201crelevant prohibited ground\u201d to deem that Ms. Deschambeault\u2019s complaint was about a breach of section 7, on the grounds of national or ethnic origin (ibid).\n[44] In Corrine McAdam v. Big River First Nation, 2009 CHRT 2 (McAdam), the Tribunal took into account the Summary of Complaint form, together with the unrepresented complainant\u2019s submission at the hearing\u2019s opening, and the \u201ccontext of the complaint\u201d to clarify the respondent\u2019s identity (at para.2).\n[45] The McAdam complaint also did not specify which provisions of the Act the respondent was alleged to have breached (at para.4). The Tribunal noted in McAdam that the Commission\u2019s \u201ccomplaint summary\u201d was \u201c\u2026attached to the complaint form\u2026\u201d and \u201c\u2026constituted part of the complaint material \u2026sent to the Tribunal when the Commission referred the complaint \u2026for inquiry\u201d (ibid). The complaint summary specified section 5 as the \u201c\u2026provision of the Act applicable to this case\u201d, and the Tribunal deemed section 5 as the applicable section (ibid).\n[46] The above cases demonstrate that where a complaint does not specify either the section of the Act alleged to have been breached or the grounds upon which the breach is based, or who the respondent is, the Tribunal has taken into account and accepted information in the Commission\u2019s Summary of Complaint form to clarify these issues.\n[47] I conclude that the Summary of Complaint form is an administrative document, drafted by Commission personnel and is attached to the Commission\u2019s Referral Letter. In this Complaint, the Complainant had no input into the form.\n[48] The above two cases demonstrate that the Tribunal has given the Summary of Complaint form weight in clarifying which section of the Act apply to a complaint, and, together with other evidence, to clarify the correct respondent, but not to decide the scope of a complaint.\n[49] In Deschambeault, the Tribunal was satisfied that the Summary of Complaint form itself established the answer to the issue. In McAdam, the Tribunal took into account not only the Summary of Complaint form, but also the complainant\u2019s opening submissions, as well as the \u201ccontext of the complaint\u201d, in coming to its decision.\n[50] I find that the issue in the within Complaint with respect to the weight to be attached to the Summary of Complaint form is different than the clarifications required in Deschambeault and McAdam. Here, the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to limit [my italics] the scope of the Complaint by placing significant weight on the fact that the Summary of Complaint form does not include any section of the Act citing harassment nor does it state the ground of the alleged harassment.\n[51] The Respondent submits that the Summary of Complaint form was revised to \u201cmore accurately reflect the Complainant\u2019s allegations\u201d and that the \u201cscope of the complaint was modified to be adverse impact on the grounds of disability (failure to accommodate)\u2026\u201d The Complainant submits that he was never consulted about nor did he have input into the amendment to the Summary of Complaint form.\n[52] I find that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Kanagasabapathy (supra, at para.29) applies. It is the Commission\u2019s letter to the Tribunal Chair, referring a complaint for an inquiry, which is the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of the scope of a complaint. This \u201c\u2026is the document that determines whether the complaint has been referred in its entirety or not\u201d (ibid) I find that a consequence of the decision in Kanagasabapathy is that, as in Deschambeault and McAdam, the Tribunal can use the Summary of Complaint form as an aid to clarify aspects of a complaint, but not to limit its scope.\n[53] The investigator amended the Summary of Complaint form in this Complaint. The amendment deleted reference to section 10 of the Act. However, the allegation under section 10 of the Act, which related to whether the \u201cright fit\u201d policy discriminates or tends to discriminate against people who share the Complainant\u2019s disability remains a category of alleged discrimination in this Complaint. It is the substance of a complaint that has weight, not the Summary of Complaint form. An investigator\u2019s view of the scope of the Complaint is also not binding on the Tribunal.\n[54] I conclude that it is the substance of a complaint that has weight, not the Summary of Complaint form, nor does the Summary of Complaint form limit the scope of the complaint if the Referral Letter does not do so. As acknowledged in Kanagasabapathy (supra), the Commission is entitled to limit or qualify the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry. As examples, it has done so in Johnston v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2007 CHRT 42, at para. 6, referred to in Kanagasabapathy, supra, at para. 30, and in Northwest Territories v. P.S.A.C. (1999) 162 F.T.R. 50, (ibid). However, it does not do so through the Summary of Complaint form, but by way of the Referral Letter, which the Commission sends directly to the Tribunal Chair.\n[55] There was no such limitation in the Referral Letter in this Complaint. Citing subsection 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Commission referred this Complaint to the Tribunal Chair for an inquiry into the Complaint, because the Commission was \u201c\u2026satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\nc. The Complainant\u2019s SOP\n[56] In paragraphs 73, 74, 75 and 76 of his SOP, the Complainant sets out the Respondent\u2019s actions which he alleges constitute harassment \u201cContrary to the CHRA\u201d. This section of his SOP is headed \u201cDid the respondent demonstrate wilful and reckless disregard for the complainant\u2019s health and welfare\u201d.\n[57] Paragraph 73 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP states:\n\u201cContrary to the CHRA [footnote 20 beside \u201cCHRA\u201d quotes subsection 14(1)(c) and section 59 of the Act], Mr. Gardiner then wantonly bullied, threatened, intimidated and otherwise harassed the complainant. Mr. Gardiner was persistent in his\noffensive behaviour despite repeated cautions from the complainant regarding his health condition and that Mr. Gardiner\u2019s intentions\/actions were inappropriate and injurious.\u201d\n[58] Paragraph 74 alleges that the Coast Guard Commissioner and the Deputy Minister at the time \u201cwere made aware\u201d of the DGMCP\u2019s behaviour, remained silent, \u201cif not complicit in that repetitive intimidation and harassment\u201d. After the word \u201cintimidation\u201d, there is a footnoted reference to Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat policy on certain behaviours, which \u201c\u2026includes harassment within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\u201d\n[59] I find that the Complainant\u2019s SOP not only alleges that the Respondent harassed the Complainant contrary to the Act, it also cites the Act\u2019s sections on harassment. Section 59 is erroneously cited, and the May 29 Ruling dealt with this error. But subsection 14(1)(c) is also cited.\nd. Connection between harassment and a prohibited ground\n[60] The Respondent submits that nothing in the Complaint connects the DGMCP\u2019s alleged actions to a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Act. The Complainant\u2019s position is that the harassment is directly related to his disability. He also submits that the Complaint alleged harassment related to his disability, and that he detailed the harassment allegation.\n[61] The Complainant states at paragraph 8 of the Complaint that during DGMCP\u2019s alleged harassment of the Complainant, the DGMCP questioned the \u201cveracity\u201d of the Complainant\u2019s disability. The Complainant bases all his other allegations of discrimination on the ground of his disability. No other ground is mentioned in both the Complaint or the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\n[62] I therefore conclude that the Complainant\u2019s disability is the ground on which the harassment allegation is based.\ne. Workplace dispute\n[63] The Respondent\u2019s submission that the interactions which the Complainant characterizes as harassment were actually a workplace dispute goes to the merits of the harassment allegation. It is premature at this stage for the Tribunal to make a decision on the merits of this allegation (Tabor, supra).\nf. Prejudice\n[64] The Respondent\u2019s submissions on how including harassment in the Complaint would prejudice the Respondent\u2019s rights to a fair hearing are set out above under \u201cRespondent\u2019s Position\u201d.\ng. Does the inclusion of harassment constitute a \u201cnew complaint\u201d?\n[65] The Respondent submits that it would be prejudiced if the Complaint were deemed to include or was amended to include subsection 14(1)(c) harassment because that allegation constitutes a substantially new complaint, and that even further particulars would not enable the Respondent to properly defend itself, and would prejudice its right to procedural fairness.\n[66] In considering whether the harassment allegation constitutes a new complaint, I have taken the following into account:\nparagraph 5 of the Complaint alleged that the Complainant sent an email to the Commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard (Commissioner) because he was an Employment Equity \u201cChampion\u201d;\nthe email told the Commissioner about the Complainant\u2019s difficulties in obtaining what the Complainant felt was a proper response to his accommodation request;\nthe Complainant received a responding email from the then DGMCP Gardiner, on behalf of the Commissioner (later withdrawn);\nparagraph 5 further alleges how the Complainant\u2019s Director became involved regarding the Complainant\u2019s accommodation request, and that the Respondent still provided no satisfactory answer to that request;\nComplaint paragraph 7 describes the Complainant\u2019s subsequent email to the Commissioner, copied to the Deputy Minister and another individual who were EE Champions;\nin this email, he told the Commissioner, among other things, that there was a problem in the department regarding its seeming inability or disinterest in accommodating persons with the Complainant\u2019s type of disability;\nparagraph 8 alleges that the then DGMCP responded, and in the Complainant\u2019s view, harassed him, which harassment included questioning \u201cthe veracity\u201d of the Complainant\u2019s disability and repeatedly requesting meetings with the Complainant to discuss the Complainant\u2019s \u201caccommodation request\u201d;\nthe allegations are that the DGMCP wanted to engage with the Complainant about his accommodation request and continued to require this engagement for a time.\n[67] These allegations have not been established. They will only be established based on admissible evidence at the hearing. However, for the purposes of this motion, I find that on their face, the course of conduct and alleged harassment they describe is related to the Complainant\u2019s accommodation request and the issue of accommodation in this Complaint.\nI therefore find that the alleged contacts between the Complainant and the DGMCP which the Complainant characterizes as harassment contrary to the Act, and between the Complainant and other personnel at DFO arise out of the same set of circumstances as the Complaint and are part of the narrative of this Complaint. They therefore do not constitute a new complaint and do not prejudice the Respondent\u2019s right to procedural fairness.\nh. The Commission and Respondent\u2019s SOPs\n[68] The Commission is not participating in this Motion, and therefore offers no reason why its SOP did not address harassment. The Tribunal cannot speculate on those reasons. I find that the Tribunal cannot make any inference from that omission about whether harassment is included in the Complaint.\n[69] In assessing potential prejudice to the Respondent, I take into account that the Respondent\u2019s SOP also did not address the harassment allegations in the Complaint and in the Complainant\u2019s SOP. It is fair to find that one of the reasons the Respondent did not address harassment was that in its opinion, harassment within the meaning of the Act was not part of the Complaint.\n[70] A significant factor which I find mitigates any actual prejudice a clarification or amendment to include harassment may have caused the Respondent is that a hearing date has not yet been set. Therefore, the Tribunal can allocate sufficient time for the Respondent to revise its SOP to address the harassment allegation, and to find and disclose arguably relevant documents related to the harassment allegation. I also note that the Respondent\u2019s list of intended witnesses in its SOP (at para.76) includes former DGMCP Gardiner, who figures in the Complainant\u2019s allegation of harassment.\ni. DFO no longer employs witness\n[71] The Respondent\u2019s submission that DFO no longer employs former DGMCP Gardiner is another factor I take into account in assessing prejudice. That factor is balanced by the Complainant\u2019s submission that the former DGMCP is presently employed by Service Canada as the ADM for Western Canada and the Territories.\n[72] I find that the Respondent can contact him, receive information from him, and call him as a witness. The fact that former DGMCP Gardiner is no longer as easily available to be a witness as he was shortly after the Complaint was filed is an inconvenience \u2013 it does not rise to the level of an actual prejudice impacting on the fairness of the hearing.\n[73] The Respondent submits that the passage of time is another way in which it is prejudiced. However, the passage of time impacts the Complainant in the same way.\n[74] For the above reasons, I conclude that the Respondent is not prejudiced by the inclusion in the Complaint of the allegation that the Respondent harassed the Complainant on the ground of disability, within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act.\n[75] In the interests of clarity, and even though I have found that the Complaint and the Complainant\u2019s SOP include the allegation of harassment, this Ruling orders that the Complaint be formally amended to include harassment on the ground of disability, contrary to subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act.\n[76] The fact that this Ruling formally amends the Complaint to include the allegation of harassment within the meaning of subsection 14(1)(c) does not establish that allegation. The Tribunal can only decide if it has been established after it has evaluated the admissible evidence submitted at the hearing.\nC. Is the Complainant entitled to disclosure of the Table 1 Documents?\n1. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[77] The Complainant submits that he has and continues to request disclosure not only of documents which are arguably relevant to the accommodation issue, but \u201cto all the discrimination allegations contained\u201d in the Complaint and in his SOP.\n[78] The Complainant submits that the Respondent\u2019s disclosure to date is inadequate because it focuses mainly on the issue of accommodation, and does not include all documents which are arguably relevant to the other allegations of discrimination in the Complaint. Those allegations include harassment within the meaning of the Act, and the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice or policy of \u201cright fit\u201d, which denied the Complainant an employment opportunity on the prohibited ground of his disability, differentiated adversely against him, and for which the Respondent failed to accommodate him, contrary to section 7 of the Act. Further, the Complaint also includes allegations against the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice or policy of \u201cright fit\u201d, which is discriminatory against and denies others who share the Complainant\u2019s disability employment opportunities, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[79] In the Disclosure Motion, the Complainant sought from DFO all documents \u201crelated to any harassment investigation or discussion by senior DFO management in regards to Michael Gardiner and\/or [the Complainant]\u201d. He submitted that the Complaint and his SOP allege both the harassment and the Complainant\u2019s requests to senior management that the harassment stop.\n[80] He submits that his request for disclosure of the Table 1 documents is \u201crequired to determine whether the Respondent complied with its own harassment policy, and if so, to what degree\u201d, and that his request includes documents that can \u201cshed light on why the harassment eventually stopped.\u201d\n[81] In his Submission, the Complainant added the Linkage column in response to the May 29 Ruling\u2019s requirement, at paragraph 28, that he demonstrate \u201c\u2026how any further disclosure request complies with Rule 6\u201d. The Complainant submits that the description in the Linkage column identifies the connection of the requested documents to the \u201carguably relevant facts, issues and\/or forms of remedy stated as per Rule 6\u201d in his SOP.\n2. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[82] The Respondent\u2019s position on further documentary disclosure is set out below.\nThe Respondent has already disclosed hundreds of documents which were either in the possession of or created by the individuals named in Table 1;\nThe Complainant\u2019s disclosure request is still overly broad and general, notwithstanding the Linkage column, because the Complainant \u201cis not identifying the precise documents that the Respondent would have failed to disclose\u201d;\ntherefore, the disclosure request still amounts to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (Joanne(Johanne Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (Can LII) (Guay), at para. 43.\n3. Analysis \u2013 Relevant Portions of the Complaint\n[83] The allegations in the Complaint which are relevant to the Complainant\u2019s Submission requesting disclosure of the documents in the revised Table 1 are set out below. Many of the allegations below are the same as those under the same heading in the May 29 Ruling. Rather than asking the reader to also refer to the May 29 Ruling, I included them all here for ease of reference.\nThe Complainant has a medical condition which he states is a disability under the Act.\nIn June, 2008, he submitted an application in Selection Process 08-DFO-IA-NCR-929466 (ENG-05 Job Competition) for a not-yet-established ENG-05 position with DFO (ENG-05 position), without self-identifying as disabled and without requesting accommodation.\nIn April, 2009, after completing the assessment process, which included an interview, DFO placed him in the pool of candidates qualified for the position. The pool had an effective date of April 20, 2009 to October 20, 2010.\nThe Complainant was told that his interview was just \u201cOK\u201d, and that he would not be considered for the position once it was established.\nThe Complainant felt his disability had hindered him in the interview, as it had done before; in August, 2009, he self-identified as a person with a disability requiring accommodation. In September, 2009, he submitted an \u201cAccommodation Request\u201d form to DFO.\nDFO then offered to re-do the assessment phase of the ENG-05 Job Competition, but after it received information on specific appropriate accommodation modes for the Complainant from PSC. DFO asked the Complainant to go to the PSC Psychology Centre (\u201cPPC\u201d) to be assessed for appropriate modes of accommodation in the assessment process.\nThe Complainant disagreed and did not go to PPC. He proposed to DFO that the appropriate accommodation was to appoint him to the ENG-5 position for various reasons, including:\nthe \u201cright fit\u201d standard and practice the PSC developed and DFO used and uses in its job competition process to assess candidates is inherently discriminatory against the Complainant and others with his disability;\nthe employer\u2019s duty to accommodate applies throughout the selection process, up to and including appointment; and\nhis appointment would not cause DFO undue hardship and would close a representational gap in the Respondent\u2019s employment equity (\u201cEE\u201d) plan.\nin the next few months, the Complainant resubmitted the Accommodation Request \u201cseveral times\u201d, discussed accommodation issues and the form of the request with his supervisor, Heather Skaarup (nee MacDonald) and human resource specialists, principally Ashley Austin;\nin November, 2009, the Complainant wrote to the Coast Guard Commissioner, George Da Pont, that he was having difficulties in getting what the Complainant considered a reasonable response;\nthe Complainant\u2019s Director, Nico Pau, told the Complainant he [Pau] did not have the authority to grant the accommodation the Complainant requested and also, the Complainant was using the wrong Accommodation Request form, without identifying which form was the correct one;\nin December, 2009, the Complainant emailed Commissioner DaPont, copying Claire Dansereau and Ms. Scattolon; he stated that DFO\u2019s application of its employment equity policy was a \u201cfarce\u201d regarding people with other than physical disabilities;\nthe then Deputy General, Major Crown Projects M. Gardiner (DGMCP) and the Complainant exchanged a series of emails in which the DGMCP pressured the Complainant to meet to discuss the Complainant\u2019s accommodation request; the Complainant refused because his mental health would be adversely affected by continuing to discuss the accommodation request; the DGMCP continued to ask for the meeting, questioned the truth of the Complainant\u2019s disability and promised disciplinary action if the Complainant did not meet with him;\nthe Complainant informed Commissioner Da Pont that Da Pont needed to stop the DGMCP from acting on the Commissioner behalf and stop harassing the Complainant;\nDFO declined the Complainant\u2019s accommodation proposal.\nthe \u201cright fit\u201d determination is a systemic barrier to persons with disabilities;\nthe Complaint\u2019s requested remedies in the Complaint were: an apology from senior managers; credit for 2 sick days the Complainant had to take off to protect his mental health; damages for pain and suffering (withdrawn later); confirmation that DFO failed to accommodate him; confirmation that DFO will comply with its policy.\n[84] The Complainant\u2019s SOP sought additional remedies, including compensation for wilful and reckless discrimination and pay differential.\n4. Analysis \u2013 Statutory Law and Tribunal Rules of Procedure\n[85] Subsection 50(1) of the Act states:\n\u201cAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d\n[86] Rule 6 of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-05) (Rules) requires parties to a complaint to provide a Statement of Particulars (SOP), which includes, among other things, documentary disclosure.\n[87] For the purposes of the Complainant\u2019s Submission, Rules 6(1)(d) and (e) are again particularly relevant.\n[88] Rule 6(1)(d) states:\n\u201cWithin the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out, \u2026\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\u201d\nRule 6(1)(d) therefore limits the disclosure obligation to \u201cdocuments\u2026that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule\u201d.\nRule 6(1)(e) requires another list of documents in the party\u2019s possession, setting out \u201cdocuments for which privilege is claimed\u201d. The rest of 6(1)(e) repeats the language in 6(1)(d).\n5. The standard for disclosure pursuant to Rule 6\n[89] The pre-hearing standard for the disclosure of documents has been established to be \u201carguable relevance\u201d. For a document to be arguably relevant, there must be a nexus or rational connection between the document requested and a fact, issue, or form of relief sought or identified by the parties (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (Can LII) (\u201cSeeley\u201d), at para. 6. An arguably relevant document may or may not be admissible at the hearing, but admissibility at the hearing is not the standard for pre-hearing disclosure.\n[90] Each party must disclose all arguably relevant documents in its possession. A respondent does not meet that obligation if it only discloses documents that in its opinion, are sufficient for the opposite party to establish a prima facie case.\n[91] Subject to the comments below regarding \u201cadvice\u201d, I conclude that in the Linkage column of Table 1, the Complainant has provided a nexus between the documents he requests be disclosed and issues, facts or forms of relief in the Complaint and in his SOP.\n[92] For example, regarding arguably relevant documents to, from, or copied to the former DGMCP Gardiner, he relates such documents to the failure to accommodate and harassment issues in the Complaint. There is no dispute that the Complainant and the DGMCP corresponded. The Complainant characterized these correspondences and the discussions he had with the DGMCP as harassment within the meaning of the Act. Harassment is an issue in the Complaint and in the Complainant\u2019s SOP \u2013 therefore, the requested documents are arguably relevant, and should be disclosed. I note that in the Disclosure Motion, the Complainant requested arguably relevant documents regarding any investigation regarding his allegation of harassment. This disclosure is also ordered in this Ruling in light of the amendment to the Complaint.\n[93] Another example is the description in the Linkage column regarding Commissioner Da Pont. The Complainant alleges in the Complaint that he asked the Commissioner to direct the DGMCP to stop contacting him about the accommodation situation, because the Complainant felt he was being harassed. The Complainant also alleged the systemic lack of accommodation by the DFO as a department for those who shared the Complainant\u2019s disability. The request for disclosure is also therefore connected to the issues in the Complaint and in the Complainant\u2019s SOP, and is arguably relevant\n[94] Regarding the other named individuals in Table 1, the Linkage column relates the documents requested for each individual to the failure to accommodate and harassment issues, which are in the Complaint and the Complainant\u2019s SOP; or to the \u201ccompetition and accommodation process[es]\u201d, which are also part of the Complaint and the parties\u2019 Statements of Particulars; or to the \u201cright fit\u201d issue, also part of the Complaint and the parties\u2019 SOPs. They are therefore arguably relevant.\n[95] In addition, Ms. Skaarup (formerly MacDonald) was named in the Respondent\u2019s SOP as the individual appointed to the relevant position pursuant to departmental employment equity goals for the position. Therefore, requests for documents around the process which resulted in her selection, participation and deployment, as set out in the Linkage column, are connected to the issues and facts in the Complaint and the parties\u2019 SOPs and are arguably relevant.\n[96] I note that in the Linkage column, the Complainant has requested disclosure of documents related to \u201cadvice\u201d. He does not clarify what he means by advice. I note that Rule 6(1)(e) applies to documents which are privileged under the law of evidence.\nD. Confidentiality Ruling is in effect\n[97] The Confidentiality Ruling previously issued for this Complaint remains in effect.\nE. Case Management Conference Call\n[98] As soon as practicable, the Tribunal shall hold a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) with all the parties, to set timelines for the Respondent and Commission to each file an amended Statement of Particulars regarding the allegation of harassment, in accordance with Rule 6, if they wish to do so, and for the Complainant\u2019s amended Reply thereto, if he wishes to file one.

Background\n[1] There are presently two complaints before the Tribunal respecting alleged discrimination and discriminatory practices pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. H-6 (\u201cthe CHRA\u201d).\n[2] The Tribunal has previously set forth the history of this matter up to November 7, 2013, in its Ruling dated April 7, 2014.\n[3] Hearing dates were set for May 20 to 23, 2014, and subsequently, another period for continuation was set for the week of September 8, 2014. The parties continued with disclosure and disagreements by the Respondent, which the Complainant argued the disclosure was lacking key documents and the issue of redactions contained in the documents. The parties, by consent, agreed to adjourn the May 20 to 24, 2014 hearing dates, but would work towards the commencement of the hearing on September 8, 2014. This did not occur, as on August 13, 2014, at the request of the parties, the matter was adjourned sine die for settlement discussions.\n[4] On or about December 14, 2014, at the request of the Complainant, a Case Conference Management Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) was convened on January 7, 2015, and hearing dates were set for June 22 to 26, 2015, and September 14 to 18, 2015.\n[5] At a subsequent CMCC on April 27, 2015, the Complainant raised issues concerning disclosure and the Complainant and the Respondent corresponded with disclosure and further disclosure was sought up to June 16, 2015.\n[6] The hearing commenced on June 22, 2015, and at the outset, no preliminary motions were brought by either party.\n[7] The hearing was adjourned on June 25, 2015, with respect to allegations of:\na) non-disclosure; and\nb) pending a ruling by the Tribunal brought by the Respondent, as to whether or not there was an agreement as to parts of the complaint and therefore as to the scope of the Inquiry.\n[8] At the CMCC on July 6, 2015, the dates of September 11 to 18, 2015 were set aside to deal with preliminary matters and Respondent counsel was directed to advise as to whether or not he would call viva voce evidence with respect to the issue of an agreement.\n[9] The Respondent, on July 31, 2015, advised that no further evidence was to be called and the Tribunal issued a Ruling in letter format dated August 31, 2015, which stated in part:\nThe last issue is the question of disclosure. It is noteworthy that at the outset of the hearing both parties indicated that they were prepared to proceed. One would have anticipated that the Respondent, if there were disclosure concerns, ought to have raised the objection at that time. It is disquieting that disclosure issues and objections are raised on the 4th day of the scheduled hearing. However, the Tribunal is left in a quandary by the Respondent counsel\u2019s letter of July 31, 2015, wherein it states:\n\u201cGiven the respondent\u2019s election not to call evidence, please advise whether the dates currently reserved in September to hear outstanding issues are still required.\u201d\nThe Tribunal is unable to determine if the Respondent\u2019s objections concerning disclosure are still outstanding or if they have been abandoned by the Respondent. The Respondent is directed to advise the Tribunal by the End of Business on September 2, 2015 as to its position on this issue.\nIn a letter dated August 11, 2015, Complainant counsel noted that there were still disclosure issues respecting the Respondent. These issues will have to be addressed.\nFinally, the hearings will resume on Wednesday, September 16, 2015, at 9:30 a.m.\n[10] The dates of September 11 to 18, 2015 were not used and were adjourned; the parties were directed that any outstanding disclosure matters were to be filed.\n[11] The Respondent has filed its Motion.\n[12] The present Motion, brought by the Complainant, seeks:\nAn order that the Respondent produce a Corporate Administrative System report containing the ages of Customs Inspectors and Border Services Officers hired externally in Pacific Region from 2001 to 2009 (\u201cCAS Report\u201d);\nAn order that the Respondent produce assessment materials of two candidates (herein referred to as Candidates A and B for privacy reasons) who were deemed not qualified in the Respondent employer\u2019s selection process 2005-BSF-OC-PAC-1001 but who received employment opportunities pursuant to different selection processes;\nAn order that the Respondent produce a sampling of assessment materials for candidates in selection process 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002 who (i) were screened out of the competition based on lack of experience and (ii) were initially screened into the competition but who the selection boardfound to be unqualified based on the submitted portfolio of competencies;\nFurther to the order in the preceding paragraph 3, a direction that the Respondent make available the assessment materials to the Complainant who will select a sampling of the materials of ten candidates screened out at each of the identified stages of the process;\nThat the Tribunal fix a deadline for the Complainant to file a written reply to the Respondent\u2019s response, if any, to the present motion;\nThat the Tribunal grant a brief oral hearing of the present motion by way of Case Management Conference Call.\n[13] In support of the Complainant\u2019s Motion for disclosure, the Complainant had filed the affidavit of Tracy Brown, affirmed the 14th day of October, 2015, written representations of October 29, 2015, and the Complainant\u2019s Reply Brief of November 13, 2015, which contained the Affidavit of Lily Black, affirmed the 13th day of November, 2015.\n[14] The Respondent filed a written response dated October 29, 2015, and, at paragraph 2 of its written representations, stated:\n2. The Respondent\u2019s position on each of the requested orders is as follows: (a) the Respondent agrees to produce a CAS Report setting out the age of employees hired as Border Services Officers in the Pacific Region from 2001 to 2009; (b) while the Respondent maintains that the documents in question are not relevant, for reasons of adjudicative efficiency it agrees to produce the assessment materials of candidates A and B in selection process 2005-BSF-OC-PAC-100; (c) the documents sought from selection process 2005-BSF-OC-PAC-1001 are not subject to production pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and (5) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Riles and Procedure (the \u201cRules\u201d); and (d) in the alternative, if the Tribunal makes an order for production of the documents sought from selection process 2005-BSF-OC-PAC-1001 the sampling procedure suggested by the Complainant is wholly inappropriate. (Emphasis added)\n[15] Furthermore, at paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Respondent\u2019s written representations dated October 29, 2015, is the following:\n11. The respondent agrees to produce the requested CAS Report.\n12. While the respondent maintains that the documents in question do not rise to meet the standard of being arguably relevant, for reasons of administrative-efficiency and to save further effort and expense, the respondent agrees to produce the Assessment Materials of A & B.\n[16] At the end of the Respondent\u2019s written submissions, it appeared that the only outstanding matter was the third head of relief dealing with samplings of assessments.\nII. Analysis and Ruling\nA. Issue No. 1\n[17] This is the Motion for:\n(a) An order that the Respondent produce a Corporate Administrative System report containing the ages of Customs Inspectors and BorderServices Officers hired externally in Pacific Region from 2001 to 2009 (\u201cCAS Report\u201d);\n[18] One would have assumed that this was a non-issue. Not so in the present Complaint. The Respondent has not produced the CAS Report setting out the ages of Border Services Officer hired externally in the Pacific Region from 2001 to 2009. In reviewing the Complainant\u2019s Motion, the phrase \u201chired externally in the Pacific Region\u201d (emphasis added) was clear, as was the submission of the Complainant in paragraphs 66 and 67 of the Complainant\u2019s Motion for disclosure. This ought not to have come as a surprise to the Respondent as it was specifically requested by letter of June 16, 2015, Exhibit \u201cU\u201d to the Affidavit of Tracy Brown, affirmed the 14th day of October, 2015. The Complainant, in an extensive Brief submitting his rationale for disclosure and the relevant legislation and authorities to support such a Motion.\n[19] The Respondent has agreed to the disclosure and has provided no salient argument for why it ought not to be disclosed.\nB. Ruling\n[20] Therefore, the Respondent shall forthwith and in any event, within 21 days of the date of this Ruling, provide the Complainant with the materials requested as set forth in paragraph 1 of the Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion.\n[21] The Tribunal, if necessary, will hear submissions for an extension of time if so is required.\nA. Issue No. 2\n[22] This is the Motion for:\n(b) An order that the Respondent produce assessment materials of two candidates (hereinafter referred to as Candidates A and B for Privacy reasons) who were deemed not qualified in the Respondent\u2019s employer\u2019s selection process 2005-BSF-OC-PAC-1001 but who received employment opportunities pursuant to different selection processes (\u201cAssessment Materials of A and B\u201d).\nB. Ruling\n[23] As there has been agreement with respect to same, this material shall be supplied to the Complainant within 21 days of the date of this Ruling.\n[24] The Tribunal, if necessary, will hear submissions for an extension of time if so is required.\nA. Issue No. 3\n[25] This is the Motion for:\n(c) An order that the Respondent produce a sampling of assessment materials for candidates in selection process 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002 who (i) were screened out of the competition based on lack of experience and (ii) were initially screened into the competition but who the selection board found to be unqualified based on the submitted portfolio of competencies;\n(d) Further to the order in the preceding paragraph 3, a direction that the Respondent make available the assessment materials to the Complainant who will select a sampling of the materials of ten candidates screened out at each of the identified stages of the process;\n[26] The Complainant argues that the samples from selection process 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002, with respect to candidates who were screened out of the competition based on lack of experience and who were initially screened into the competition but were found to be unqualified on their submitted portfolio of competencies, are in fact relevant and germane.\n[27] The Complainant\u2019s position for same is set forth in paragraphs 77 and 78 of the Complainant\u2019s Motion Brief, which states that they are relevant for comparison of the Complainant\u2019s qualifications in addition to qualifications of younger candidates being qualified against candidates who failed out of the competition. Also, it was submitted that for every selection board, there is a bare minimum of qualifications, and then the standards applied for the remaining screening process. In the present circumstances, Mr. Hughes, the Complainant herein, alleges that the screening board deviated in following those standards.\n[28] The Respondent argues that the request by the Complainant does not meet the standard of \u201crelevance.\u201d Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the request for the candidate sampling is \u201cboth speculative and the very definition of a fishing expedition.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief of October 29, 2015, at paragraph 16)\n[29] The Respondent relies on Johanne Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (\u201cGuay\u201d), at para. 43, wherein Member Michel Doucet stated:\nThe request must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d. The description of the documents should not be too broad or general and should be identified with reasonable particularity. Finally, the request should not be oppressive, that is, should not subject a stranger to the litigation to an onerous and far-ranging search for documents. (See CTEA v. Bell Canada T503\/2098, Ruling No. 2)\n[30] Furthermore, it is submitted that there must be, as recognized by previous Tribunals, a nexus between what is sought and the issues in dispute. In this case, with respect to candidate sampling, Respondent counsel submits that such a nexus does not exist and furthermore states, at paragraph 17 of his Brief, as follows:\nThe unassailable flaw in the Complainant\u2019s assertion of relevance is that he was not himself screened out of the selection process for lack of experience at the outset. Nor was he initially screened into the competition only to later be found unqualified on his submitted POCs.\n[31] The Respondent also argues relevancy and the Complainant would be requesting the right to search the Respondent\u2019s records, without restriction. The Respondent takes the position that a sampling in fact distorts the process and, if production were ordered, all of the documents should be ordered; not only a sampling.\n[32] The Complainant asserts that the Respondent has failed to realize that there are two elements to the Complaint:\n\u2026[O]ne alleging the employer discriminated against the Complainant personally on the basis of age and disability, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the other alleging that the employer pursued a policy or practice that, contrary to section 10, deprived individuals of employment opportunities on the basis of age. (Complainant\u2019s Reply Brief dated November 13, 2015, at paragraph 11)\n[33] The Complainant maintains that these documents are not speculative and are not a fishing expedition, and that the Respondent has already disclosed names of candidates in other competitions at issue, but has not done so for the specific competition 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002. The Complainant has modified its request to seek:\n19. In sum, to be clear, the Complainant is requesting the assessment materials for Candidate #1 to Candidate #9 as an alternative to disclosure of the assessment materials for all relevant candidates. (Complainant\u2019s Reply Brief dated November 13, 2015, at paragraph 19)\n[34] In the alternative, at paragraph 20 of the Complainant\u2019s Reply Brief, the Complainant stated:\nAs an alternative to the disclosure of the assessment material for all candidates screened out of the competition for lack of experience, the Complainant requests an order that the Respondent produce a list of the names of candidates screened out of the competition at this stage from which the Complainant will select assessment materials, without prejudice to his position that the assessment material of all candidates is arguably relevant to his complaint.\n[35] Thus, the Complainant had made an initial request in his Motion and then provided two alternatives for consideration which, for various reasons, the Respondent takes issue with.\n[36] The Respondent argues that the requirement to produce all of the documentation would be extremely onerous and would put the Respondent to considerable effort and additional expense where the relevance is purely speculative.\n[37] In Guay (supra), at paragraph 44, the Tribunal referred to the case of Day v. Department of National Defence and Hortie (Hortie), Ruling No. 3, 2002\/12\/06:\ni. The Tribunal should determine whether the information is likely to be relevant, which is not a particularly high standard. There must be some relevance, and the party seeking production of the information or documents must demonstrate a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute. The material must be probative and arguably relevant to an issue in the hearing. This is meant to prevent production for purposes which are speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming.\nii. The Tribunal must then consider any other issues that may have a bearing on disclosure, without examining the documents. If there is no compelling reason to maintain the privacy of the documents, they should be released.\niii. If the Tribunal is unable to resolve the matter without examining the material, it should inspect the documents. In the final step of this process, it may be helpful for the party requiring the documents to be protected to draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to passages or individual documents that raise concerns.\n[38] As noted in Hortie (supra), whether the information is likely relevant is \u201cnot a particularly high standard.\u201d In the present circumstances, the threshold of \u201carguably relevant\u201d has been met and there is a nexus to the documentation and the claim; therefore the documentation is disclosable. However, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s position that to produce all of the documentation at this juncture may cause difficulties and have significant economic impact upon the Respondent.\nB. Ruling\n[39] The Tribunal therefore orders:\nThe Respondent to produce the assessment materials of Candidate #1 through Candidate #9, without prejudice to the Complainant\u2019s position that the assessment material of all candidates is relevant, or alternatively;\nThe Respondent to produce a list of the names of candidates screened out of the competition at this stage from which the Complainant will select assessment materials, without prejudice to his position that the assessment material of all candidates ought to be provided.\n[40] If the materials are lacking the specificity required, or are inadequate, the Tribunal will review the Order respecting disclosure of all documents requested.\n[41] The said materials shall be provided within 21 days of the date of this Ruling.\n[42] The Tribunal, in necessary, will hear submissions for an extension of time if so is required.\n[43] The Tribunal does not believe there will be any privacy concerns, but would reiterate the Ruling made on April 7, 2014, wherein I ordered:\na) The parties and their representatives to keep confidential all information regarding the identity of job candidates unrelated to the Complaint.\nb) That during the hearing process, although the names would be open, the Tribunal will ensure whenever possible that their names not appear in a decision.\n[44] The hearing dates resuming the week of April 4, 2016 are confirmed and any further motions will be heard at the commencement of the hearing.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Conclusion 18\n[1] This is a motion by the complainant, Mr. Keith Waddle (\u201cComplainant\u201d) to amend his Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) to include allegations related to a claim of discrimination on the ground of family status (the \u201cMotion\u201d). Each of the respondents, Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC), object to the Motion. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) has taken no position.\nI. History of the Complaint\n[2] The Complainant filed complaints with the CHRC against CPR and TCRC on March 28, 2012. The original complaints did not, on their face, include any allegations related to discrimination based upon family status. Instead, the allegations in the complaints related strictly to an alleged disability. The two complaints were consolidated on referral to the Tribunal as they involved substantially the same issues of fact and law and, are hereinafter referred to as the \u201cComplaints.\u201d\n[3] Approximately 17 months after the Complaints were filed, a CHRC investigator contacted CPR and TCRC by letter dated August 28, 2013, and indicated:\nI have attached to this letter, an Amended Summary of Complaint form which adds the ground of Family Status to the complaint. This has been done without amending the complaint form as both parties have responded to the allegations brought up by the complainant.\n[4] On the same date, an investigator for the CHRC also contacted the Complainant and by way of letter, enclosing the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms and indicating:\nI have attached to this letter the amended Summary of Complaint forms which adds the ground of Family Status to the complaints. This has been done without amending the complaint for\n[5] At that time, the Summary of Complaint Forms were amended to include family status as a ground of discrimination under section 7 of the CHRA. The August 28, 2013 letter addressed to CPR and TCRC stated that the CHRC would not be amending the Complaints as both Respondents had already had an opportunity to respond to the family status allegations in the course of the investigation. TCRC objected in writing to the addition of family status as a ground of discrimination. There is no evidence before me that the CHRC responded to that objection.\n[6] The CHRC\u2019s Investigation Report in this matter, issued on May 1, 2014, stated the Complainant did not provide any reasonable grounds to support his allegations of a claim of discrimination based on family status, and so the investigator did not pursue the claim.\n[7] The Acting Chief Commissioner of the CHRC referred this matter to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) on July 30, 2014, by way of letter of request indicating that a \u201ccopy of the complaint forms is enclosed.\u201d Attached to that letter were copies of the two Amended Summary of Complaint Forms, copies of the two original Summary of Complaint Forms, and copies of the Complaints. In each of the two Amended Summary of Complaint Forms, family status was included as a ground of discrimination. The Complaints, as referred to the Tribunal and without consideration of the Amended Summary Complaint Forms, on their face, contain no reference to allegations associated with discrimination based on family status, but only allege discrimination based on disability.\n[8] Following referral of this matter to the Tribunal, the Complainant sought representation and on October 7, 2014, the Complainant\u2019s counsel was provided with the CHRC\u2019s disclosure, including the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms. Despite the substance of the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms, when Complainant\u2019s counsel filed the SOP on October 30, 2014, no reference was made to discrimination based on family status. The Complainant\u2019s position is that he understood prior to referral of the matter to the Tribunal, based on representations made to him by the CHRC, that the family status ground had been rejected due to a limitation period. As a result of this understanding, he allegedly told his counsel not to pursue it in the SOP.\n[9] Following the filing of the Complainant\u2019s SOP, CPR and the TCRC then filed their SOPs, and the matter proceeded through disclosure and to the first day of the hearing, without any of the Complainant, CPR or TCRC making reference before the Tribunal to allegations of discrimination based on family status.\n[10] The hearing into this matter began November 16, 2015. At the initiation of the hearing, the presiding Registry Officer read into the record the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms. They included reference to both disability and family status as alleged grounds of discrimination. At that time it became apparent counsel for each of the Complainant, CPR and TCRC had understood that the matter was proceeding to a hearing based on disability as the sole alleged ground of discrimination. CPR and TCRC objected to any evidence being led with regard to the family status discrimination claim. The CHRC did not appear at the hearing and no submissions were made on its behalf.\n[11] Complainant\u2019s counsel confirmed at that stage of the hearing that he had not been aware that family status had been included in the Amended Summary of Complaint Form and had drafted and filed the SOP considering only disability. Following a pause in the proceedings during which he was able to confer with his client, Complainant\u2019s counsel requested an adjournment of the hearing to proceed with an application to amend the SOP to deal with family status allegations. I briefly delayed the adjournment request to allow for the hearing of some previously scheduled evidence.\n[12] After a brief continuation of the hearing, it was adjourned at the request of the Complainant, and on consent of the Respondents, as a result of an unrelated matter. Following that adjournment, the Complainant continued to be represented by counsel for a short period of time. Subsequently, he advised he was no longer represented by counsel and was moving ahead with a motion to amend his SOP to deal with any outstanding matters, including the family status allegations.\n[13] In the Motion filed December 26, 2015, the Complainant confirmed he was seeking an amendment to his SOP to include family status. He recounted the process of filing his complaints before the CHRC and of the consideration of the family status ground at the CHRC stage, but did not set out the amendment he was seeking or any detail regarding the family status allegation. The Complainant was directed by this Tribunal to provide further detail of his family status claim. He did so on February 4, 2016, by way of an addendum to the Motion (the \u201cAddendum\u201d).\nII. The Family Status Allegations\n[14] The original Complaints in this matter allege discrimination based on disability as a result of CPR and TCRC, or both of them, having failed to adequately accommodate the Complainant\u2019s alleged disability over the time period from July 2011 to February 7, 2012. The Complainant states in the original SOP that by February 7, 2012, he had been fully accommodated.\n[15] The substance of the family status allegations in the Addendum are, in essence, that during a process of arriving at an accommodation for the Complainant\u2019s alleged disability, CPR or TCRC, or both of them, did not properly disclose to others within their organization that the Complainant had family obligations in Lethbridge, Alberta, where he was then residing and working. The discrimination based on family status is alleged to have occurred between July 2011 and April 30, 2012.\nIII. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[16] The Complainant argues that the family status allegations appropriately form part of his Complaint and that there would be no prejudice to the other parties in allowing his motion to amend his SOP.\n[17] The Tribunal has the authority to grant amendments in order to determine \u201c\u2026the real questions in controversy between the parties,\u201d if granting the amendments would \u201c\u2026serve the interests of justice\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), (\u201cCanderel\u201d), cited in Canada (A.G.) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30 (\u201cParent\u201d); Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation 2013 CHRT 9 (\u201cTabor\u201d) at para. 4. While I acknowledge that the preceding authorities were discussing amendments to the complaint itself, based on the same reasoning, and for the same purposes, I find that the SOP that particularizes those complaints is subject to the same flexible amendment process.\nIV. The Respondents\u2019 Positions\n[18] The Respondents each provided their initial arguments opposing the Complainant\u2019s application to amend his SOP. After the Complainant was directed to, and did provide further details of his allegations of discrimination based on family status in the Addendum, the Respondents provided further arguments opposing the Complainant\u2019s motion. The CHRC, while given notice of the Motion, has declined to make submissions.\n[19] TCRC has opposed the Motion on the grounds that:\n1. The family status discrimination allegation constitutes a new complaint outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;\n2. The requested amendment does not set out particulars on which the Complainant is relying in support of the family status discrimination allegation with sufficient detail; and\n3. The Complainant\u2019s Motion fails to identify a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status\n[20] CPR has opposed to the Motion on the grounds that:\n1. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to allow the amendment as a result of deficiencies in the Complaints, and as a result of the conclusions and intentions of the CHRC investigator;\n2. The requested amendment does not set out particulars on which the Complainant is relying in support of the family status discrimination allegation with sufficient detail;\n3. The Complainant\u2019s Motion fails to identify a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status;\n4. The Complainant\u2019s Motion, were it to be granted, would constitute an abuse of process; and\n5. The Complainant\u2019s Motion, were it to be granted, would be unduly prejudicial and would cause procedural inefficiencies.\n[21] The arguments of CPR and TCRC will be dealt with jointly.\nV. Jurisdiction\n[22] The arguments of TCRC and CPR with regard to jurisdiction are distinct. TCRC argued that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to amend a complaint after referral from the CHRC to add a substantially new complaint. CPR argued that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant this amendment for two reasons:\n1. The Complaints included no reference to the family status allegations, which are only referenced in the Amended Summary Complaint Form. Without a proper complaint on the ground of family status, the Tribunal has not been granted proper jurisdiction; and\n2. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested amendment because the CHRC did not investigate or intend to refer the family status claim.\nA. Jurisdiction and the Sufficiency of the Complaint\n[23] CPR argues that the failure of the Complaints to adequately describe the family status claim is a bar to this Tribunal taking jurisdiction over that element of the claim. CPR referred to Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Bell Canada, 1981 CanLII 5 (CHRT) (\u201cBell\u201d) in which the Tribunal held that it did not have jurisdiction over a matter referred by the CHRC, as the initial complaint was so insufficient, it was considered not to have been filed. The Tribunal held in Bell that:\n\u2026since a proper complaint has not been filed, this Tribunal has not been appointed in accordance with the Canadian Human Rights Act and accordingly has no jurisdiction to hear the matter before them.\n[24] The Bell decision elevates to a jurisdictional level problems with the sufficiency of a complaint\u2019s particulars. Advancing this reasoning is problematic by today\u2019s standards for two main reasons. The first pertains to the language of former s. 39(1) of the CHRA, which refers to the appointment of the Tribunal. This provision, heavily relied upon by the panel in Bell to define jurisdiction, no longer exists in the current CHRA. Secondly, a significant line of cases from the Superior Courts (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, 1992 CanLII 81 (SCC); Canada ( A.G. ) v. Robinson, 1994 CanLII 3490 (FCA); Bell Canada v. C.E.P.U., 1998 CanLII 8700 (FCA); CHRC v. C.T.E.A., 2002 FCT 776, paras. 30-32; Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v. P.S.A.C. (Local 70396), 2006 FC 704, paras. 37-54 (\u201cMuseum\u201d); Parent, supra, paras. 30-44, when read together, make it clear that for a variety of reasons, complaints do not always arrive at the Tribunal in a perfect state. But that does not mean the complaint is fatally flawed; when the issue is raised, it falls to the Tribunal to endeavour to bring the complaint into conformity with the proceedings.\n[25] The Tribunal spoke to this dynamic in Gaucher v. C.A.F. 2005 CHRT 1, at paras. 11-12 (cited with approval by the Court in Museum at para 52):\n\u201c[\u2026]It is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will often come to light in the course of the investigation. It follows that complaints are open to refinement. As long as the substance of the original complaint is respected, I do not see why the Complainant and the Commission should not be allowed to clarify and elaborate upon the initial allegations before the matter goes to a hearing.\n[26] The scope of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in a particular case is not defined by the sufficiency of the original Complaints filed by the Complainant, but by the CHRC\u2019s request for an inquiry. Deficiencies in the particulars of a complaint can be dealt with at the CHRC level through amendments, or at the Tribunal, through amendments to the complaint or through the filing of SOPs and the amendment of those SOPs.\n[27] The real jurisdictional issue in this motion is: what constituted the \u2018Complaints\u2019 that were referred to the Tribunal \u2013 the Complaints alone, or the Complaints in conjunction with the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms? The scope of this referral is particularly significant because it is clear that on their face, the Complaints are silent with regard to the family status claim.\n[28] The jurisprudence of this Tribunal has not decided conclusively whether the Summary of Complaint form constitutes part of the complaint for the purposes of jurisdiction. The Tribunal has in previous decisions considered the Summary of Complaint form in determining the nature of a complaint, where the complaint form was incomplete (See Deschambeault v. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 CHRT 48 (\u201cDeschambeault\u201d)). However, in Deschambeault, the complaint form contained all the factual allegations and the Summary of Complaint form was merely used to identify the discriminatory practice and prohibited ground reflected in those allegations. In this case, it is the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms themselves that contain the only reference to the family status aspect of the claim. The Amended Summary of Complaint Forms do not merely clarify the allegations in the Complaints. Instead, for the Tribunal to find it has jurisdiction, it would have to conclude that the Summary of Complaint Forms constitute an essential element of the Complaints.\n[29] It would have been very helpful on this issue to have some form of submission from the CHRC as to the purpose of the Summary of Complaint form, and its relationship generally to the complaint. Unfortunately, no such submission has been provided.\n[30] Based on the evidence that is before this Tribunal in this Motion, it is clear the CHRC directly advised the parties that it was not necessary to amend the original complaints, and that only the Summary of Complaint Forms would be amended in order to add the family status ground to the Complaints. Through its own process, the CHRC itself gave weight to the Summary of Complaint Form and its amendments. In addition, in its letter referring the matter to the Tribunal, the Acting Chief Commissioner of the CHRC includes all the Summary of Complaint Forms, the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms and the Complaints. Given that the referring letter itself is essentially silent on the scope of the complaint being referred, one can only conclude from a review of all the records enclosed in support, that the Summary of Complaint can serve as an instrument amending the complaint.\n[31] As a result of the particular use of the Amended Summary of Complaint Form by the CHRC in this matter, the Tribunal concludes that it does form part of the Complaints and can help to define the scope of jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\nB. Jurisdiction and the CHRC Investigator\u2019s Report\n[32] CPR also argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this matter because the CHRC\u2019s investigator did not intend for it to be investigated or referred. It is clear in the ivestigator\u2019s report that she found the Complainant did not provide any reasonable grounds to support his family status claim and so she \u201cdid not pursue the family status allegation.\u201d However, there are several problems with CPR\u2019s argument.\n[33] The first is that it is not infrequent that the CHRC refers matters to the CHRT in a manner inconsistent with the conclusions of its investigators. The investigators\u2019 reports do not form part of the referral to the CHRT, and do not define the scope of that referral. Of relevance to this point is the decision of the Tribunal in Gover v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 14, in which the Respondents challenged the referral of a portion of the complaint, based on the conclusions in the CHRC investigator\u2019s report:\n[38] In fact, it is clear that only the letter from the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal conferred legal jurisdiction for the purpose of granting the Tribunal all the powers that the Act gives to the Tribunal under sections 44(3)(a) and 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[34] Secondly, although the investigator\u2019s report indicated that the family status claim was not pursued, the CHRC did not direct any further changes to the Complaints. Earlier in the process, the CHRC had used the Amended Summary Complaint forms to add family status to the Complaints. After hearing from its investigator, the CHRC had the opportunity to dismiss the family status portion of the Complaints pursuant to s. 44(3)(b) of the CHRA. See e.g. Lindor v. PWGSC, 2014 CHRT 13, para. 2; Emmett v. CRA, 2013 CHRT 12, para. 40 (\u201cEmmett\u201d) and Johnston v. C.A.F., 2007 CHRT 42, para. 6. It chose not to do so.\n[35] Thirdly, defining the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on the investigator\u2019s report, or based on the correctness of the CHRC\u2019s decision in referring, is inconsistent with the jurisprudence of the Tribunal. It is clear that matters can be referred to the CHRT for an inquiry regardless of the conclusions of the CHRC investigator, and that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to reconsider the decision to refer in light of the investigation, which jurisdiction rests with the Federal Court.\n[36] In Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2004 CHRT 8, the Tribunal considered its jurisdiction in a similar referral situation:\n[29] In another vein, the fact that the complaint was investigated by three different investigators on behalf of the Commission over a period of two years following the filing of the complaint, that the last recommended that the matter not proceed to the Tribunal and that the Commission nevertheless referred the complaint to the Tribunal are all matters that should have been part of a judicial review of the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[30] In the case at bar, the record shows that the Respondent did not seek judicial review of the Commission's decision to refer Mr. Tweten's complaint to the Tribunal. As stated previously, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review that decision.\n[37] Accordingly, if CPR or TCRC disagreed with the scope of the matter referred in the present case, whether as a result of the investigator\u2019s conclusions or otherwise, their recourse was by way of judicial review to the Federal Court.\nC. Conclusions Re: Jurisdiction\n[38] The jurisdiction of this Tribunal in this matter is defined by the scope of the referral from the CHRC, i.e. the request to institute an inquiry. That referral included the entirety of the Complaints which, on the unique and particular facts of this case, consist of the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms and the Complaints. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to deal with both the grounds of family status and disability, and jurisdiction to grant this Motion, should it be appropriate to do so.\nVI. Insufficient Particularization of the Allegations Based on Family Status\n[39] In his initial Motion, the Complainant failed to provide any particulars in support of his allegations regarding discrimination based on family status. After receiving the Motion, each of CPR and TCRC argued that the ground was pled with insufficient particularization to allow them to prepare for and respond to it at a hearing. Specifically, it was not possible to determine from the Motion what would constitute the amendment to the SOP. Based on my own review of the Motion, I directed that the Complainant file his Addendum. The Complainant did so and in that Addendum he sets out the allegations that form the basis of his claim, including the events, the timing of said events, and the individuals involved.\n[40] CPR, in particular, has argued that the Motion was insufficient to meet the requirements in Rule 3(1)(c) of the CHRT Rules:\n3(1) Motions, including motions for an adjournment, are made by a Notice of Motion, which Notice shall\n[\u2026]\n(c) set out the relief sought and the grounds relied upon;\n[41] As held in P.S.A.C. v. Government of the Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), 1999 CanLII 19858 (CHRT), it is necessary that the respective parties provide particulars, the purpose of which is to properly define the issues, to enable parties to prepare for the hearing, to prevent surprises at the hearing, and to facilitate the hearing.\n[42] The Complainant\u2019s initial motion failed to meet the requirements of Rule 3(1)(c). The Addendum, however, includes sufficient detail of the proposed family status allegations in order for the Respondents to determine the nature of the relief sought, and to respond to the motion.\nVII. Prima Facie Case\n[43] CPR and TCRC have argued both that the allegations as set out in the Motion and the Addendum do not identify an act of discrimination and that they do not show a prima facie case of discrimination. These arguments will be dealt with jointly as, in essence, they both go to the question of whether the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination as set out in the Addendum have no chance of success, and therefore should be dismissed on a preliminary basis.\n[44] CPR notes correctly that the Complainant alleges in the Addendum that \u201c\u2026they didn\u2019t make me work out of Calgary but they sure tried to willfully hide the family status issues so I would have to work out of Calgary.\u201d The Addendum does not contain allegations regarding failure to accommodate based on family status, and the Complainant admits he was eventually accommodated in Lethbridge, from where his family obligations allegedly stem. Instead, the Addendum includes the more general allegation that the Respondents, or either of them, refused to make reference to the Complainant\u2019s family status issue in the process of accommodating the Complainant\u2019s disability.\n[45] CPR argues that the Complainant must prove a prima facie case of discrimination before the duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship is engaged. While this argument is clearly correct, the question remains whether the Complainant must meet this burden in the context of this Motion, based solely on the Addendum, or whether he should only be required to do so upon a full hearing of this matter.\n[46] In deciding whether or not to grant an amendment, \u201c\u2026the Tribunal does not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment\u201d (Tabor, supra, at para. 4). In particular, it would be extremely unusual for this Tribunal to dismiss a complaint, prior to the hearing of evidence, on the basis that the allegations did not make out a prima facie case. The decisions considering this Tribunal\u2019s authority to strike out portions of a Complaint on that basis are informative.\n[47] In Canada (H.R.C.) v. Canada (A.G.), 2012 FC 445 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d), aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 75, the Federal Court considered the issue of dismissal on a preliminary basis. The Federal Court confirmed that this Tribunal has the authority to dismiss in whole or in part a complaint on a preliminary basis, prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits. However, the Federal Court was clear that this was a power to be used cautiously:\n[140] I do, however, understand the Government to agree with the statement in Buffet that the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits should be exercised cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases: above at para. 39. I also agree with this statement.\n[48] In exercising this authority, the Tribunal must be cautious to ensure the parties have had a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make arguments on the matters at issue (see Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2013 CHRT 12). The Tribunal in Emmett noted that:\n[14] I agree that the Tribunal can dismiss all or part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits. However, it is important to remember that in the decisions rendered in FNCFCS et al. and Murray, the Federal Court and the Tribunal clearly expressed the view that in dismissing allegations the process must be fair, respecting the rules of natural justice, and the parties must be given a full and ample opportunity to adduce the evidence necessary to decide the issues raised by the motion.\n[49] I would question whether the current matter constitutes one of the clearest of cases in which this Tribunal would exercise its preliminary dismissal authority, particularly as the Complainant is now unrepresented and has not had legal assistance in drafting his submissions on this Motion. To deprive the Complainant of the opportunity to proceed with the family status aspect of his Complaints, based solely on those submissions, prepared without the benefit of counsel, would fall well short of the standard of the clearest of cases.\n[50] Further, it would not respect the principles of procedural fairness set out in FNCFCS to require the Complainant, in the context of this Motion to amend his SOP, to meet his standard of proof of a prima facie case of discrimination, and based solely on the allegations as articulated in the Addendum. Such a requirement would not provide the full and ample opportunity to adduce evidence necessary to decide the issue without a full hearing.\nVIII. Abuse of Process\n[51] CPR has argued the Complainant\u2019s Motion should be dismissed as an abuse of this Tribunal\u2019s process. This argument with regard to abuse of process was made prior to receipt of the Addendum. Two of the grounds CPR included in support of its abuse of process argument are related to lack of particularization of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination based on family status. These, I conclude, have been resolved by the provision of the Addendum.\n[52] CPR raises essentially one other ground in support of a finding of an abuse of process. CPR submits that the Addendum raised an entirely new ground of discrimination mid-way through the hearing process which either, in and of itself, constitutes an abuse of process or that, given the prejudice to CPR as a result of this late stage amendment, it would similarly constitute an abuse of process. Given the overlap in these arguments, both arguments regarding abuse of process will be addressed jointly below.\n[53] In support of its abuse of process argument, CPR makes reference to the decision of this Tribunal in Cremasco v. Canada Post Corp. 2002 CanLii 61852 (CHRT) aff\u2019d. 2004 FC 81, in which the Tribunal considered the concept of abuse of process through re-litigation of matters. However, CPR also makes reference in its arguments generally to the prejudice CPR would experience should the motion be granted. Furthermore, it emphasizes the inappropriateness of allowing this late stage amendment to the SOP after commencement of the hearing and characterizes it as generally constituting an abuse of process.\n[54] The Courts have spoken to the general inherent and residual discretion to prevent an abuse of their process. This general concept of abuse of process includes proceedings \u201cunfair to the point that they are contrary to the interest of justice\u201d (R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616), or proceedings that constitute \u201coppressive treatment\u201d (R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).\n[55] McLachlin J. (as she then was) expressed the general principles of abuse of process in this way in R. v. Scott, 1990 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 1007:\n\u2026abuse of process may be established where: (1) the proceedings are oppressive or vexatious; and, (2) violate the fundamental principles of justice underlying the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency. The concepts of oppressiveness and vexatiousness underline the interest of the accused in a fair trial. But the doctrine evokes as well the public interest in a fair and just trial process and the proper administration of justice.\n[56] See also on this point the decision in Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, para. 51 in which the Court noted that: \u201c[r]ather than focus on the motive or status of the parties, the doctrine of abuse of process concentrates on the integrity of the adjudicative process.\u201d\n[57] In Thwaites et al. 2007 CHRT 54, this Tribunal clarified the doctrine of abuse of process as it relates more specifically to re-litigation of matters:\n[9] The doctrine of abuse of process is used to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel have not been met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate principles such as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79 2003 SCC 63 (CanLII), [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at para. 37. The application of the doctrine in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings has been approved by the Federal Court: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corportion (Cremasco) 2004 FC 81 (CanLII) at para. 41; aff\u2019d 2004 FCA 363 (CanLII))\u2026\n[11] However, the Tribunal should exercise caution in applying doctrines such as abuse of process which result in the dismissal of a complaint without a hearing. Such action deprives the parties of the opportunity to present evidence and make representations regarding the alleged violation of their human rights (O\u2019Connor v. Canadian National Railway 2006 CHRT 5 (CanLII), at para. 22). Where it is apparent that the dismissal of a complaint could lead to unfairness or create an injustice, the doctrine should not be applied (Morton, at para. 24; Toronto v. C.U.P.E., para. 52).\n[58] My conclusions are threefold. First, this Motion, if granted, while late in the Tribunal\u2019s process, would not involve introduction of a new matter not previously before the CHRC or this Tribunal. The administrative path taken by these Complaints through the CHRC was not as clear as it could have been. However, I have found that the Complaints in this case do include the family status ground. This prohibited ground of discrimination formed part of the Complaints before the CHRC, was considered by the CHRC, and was referred to this Tribunal. It did not simply arise on the first day of the hearing in this matter. The family status allegations arise from the same series of events, being the accommodation process in which the Complainant and the Respondents were engaged, and they relate to a very similar time period. The family status allegations do not involve an entirely new matter, unrelated to the events already clearly set out in the Complaints and the SOP.\n[59] Secondly, the Motion, if granted, would not involve a re-litigation of matters previously decided upon in the hearing before this Tribunal, or elsewhere. While this matter is currently mid-hearing, no evidence has yet been led on the events set out in the Addendum. Under the scheme established by the CHRA, all matters are considered by the CHRC before referral to the Tribunal for inquiry. The referral is often preceded by an investigation, though this is not mandatory (see ss. 44(3)(a), 49). CHRC investigators do arrive at conclusions. However as set out earlier in this decision, in this case those conclusions were not adhered to by the CHRC itself when it exercised its discretion, which discretion is subject to judicial review by any of the parties, and requested an inquiry into the entire matter. It cannot constitute an abuse of process to then proceed before the Tribunal with the matters in respect of which the CHRC has requested an inquiry. Instead, it is the standard application of the Tribunal\u2019s statutory duty to consider the claims as referred by the CHRC, without imposing limitations based on the conclusions of the CHRC investigator.\n[60] Thirdly, it is clear from the procedural history in this matter that some confusion about the scope of the Complaint resulted from the interactions between the parties and the CHRC. While the CHRC has, perhaps unfortunately, not taken a position or provided submissions in this Motion, it is clear that the parties, most particularly the Complainant, were confused about the scope of this Complaint by the time it was referred to the Tribunal. The Complainant came to understand that those portions of his Complaints related to family status were time barred in some way, and the Respondents, upon reviewing the investigator\u2019s report (which was shared with the parties after the amendments to the Summary of Complaint Form), could reasonably have concluded that the family status claim would not form part of this matter. Such a conclusion ought to have been re-assessed however, once the Complaints were referred in their entirety, without exception or reservation.\n[61] The Complainant did have counsel at the time the SOP was filed, and at the time the Amended Summary of Complaint forms including family status as a ground were provided in the disclosure package by the CHRC. However, he was self-represented through the CHRC process, and in particular, he was self-represented at the time the CHRC directed that he not amend his Complaints but rather rely on the Amended Summary of Complaint Forms. Furthermore, he no longer has counsel of record to address these issues.\n[62] Given the issues arising prior to the referral of the Complaints, it would not constitute an abuse of the process, having regard to the more general principles of fairness of the process and access to justice, to amend the SOP to reflect more clearly the actual scope of the Complaints referred. Instead, allowing the amendment reflects procedural fairness in the face of an unrepresented Complainant, especially having regard to the procedural anomalies during the CHRC process.\nIX. Allowing the Amendment Would be Unduly Prejudicial and Cause Procedural Inefficiencies\n[63] CPR argues that if the Motion is granted, it would result in procedural inefficiencies and be unduly prejudicial. In support of this argument, CPR points to the requirement set out in the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure that matters be heard as efficiently and expeditiously as possible.\n[64] In this matter, the hearing has been adjourned on two occasions, both at the request of the Complainant. The Respondents have repeatedly stressed their reluctance to have the matter adjourned further. The Respondents are therefore left in the difficult position of either having to proceed to a hearing with little time to deal with the recently articulated allegations regarding family status, or seeking an adjournment further delaying resolution of this matter.\n[65] While I appreciate the challenges created by any amendment to the SOP at this late stage, in the circumstances of this case such amendment does not result in procedural inefficiencies or undue prejudice. First, the allegations as set out in the Addendum are brief, and arise from the same series of events as are already at issue in this matter. The time period is very similar and several of the witnesses mentioned in connection with the family status allegation are already scheduled to give evidence in this matter. Secondly, the Complainant has sought no additional forms of relief, remedial measures or amounts of compensation, and has not added any additional witnesses to his list for the hearing. Thirdly, those portions of the hearing that have already been completed were limited, consisting only of the examination in chief and the cross-examination of the Complainant\u2019s expert. These examinations were completed with the knowledge of this outstanding issue. In light of the present ruling, the Tribunal would consider requests to recall the witness to testify in respect of the family status issue, should this prove necessary.\n[66] Therefore, I conclude that any prejudice that CPR or either Respondent may experience would not be undue, and can be resolved through further disclosure, further examination of the only witness heard thus far and a brief adjournment, if necessary.\nX. Conclusion\n[67] For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal grants the Complainant\u2019s Motion to amend his SOP to include only those allegations expressly listed in the Addendum. The Respondents CPR and TCRC are granted leave to make corresponding amendments to their SOPs.\nSigned by\nRicki T. Johnston\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 10, 2016\n",

Order 14\nI. Brief Background: the Complaint and the hearing to date\n[1] The complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) of Mr. Ken Kelsh (\u201cComplainant\u201d) against the Canadian Pacific Railway (\u201cCP\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d), as amended, alleges:\ndiscrimination in employment on account of disability; adverse differential treatment and failure to accommodate, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act);\nretaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act;\nsystemic discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s testing, bidding practices and procedures, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[2] The Respondent does not dispute that the Complainant has a disability.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is not participating in the hearing and has made no submissions on this Motion.\n[4] There have been 2 sets of hearing dates: from January 11, 2016 to January 22, 2016 and from February 29, 2016 to March 3, 2016, when the Complainant closed his case.\n[5] On January 18, 2016, during the Complainant\u2019s examination in chief, the Complainant testified that the Respondent viewed him in a certain unfavourable way. His counsel then asked him if he remembered seeing Dr. Marcus Feak, psychologist, (to which the Complainant confirmed he did see Dr. Feak), and several other questions about the circumstances surrounding the report by Dr. Feak (the definition of Dr. Feak\u2019s report is articulated in more detail further on). The Complainant testified that he felt the Respondent\u2019s management viewed him the way they did because of Dr. Feak\u2019s report. The Complainant agreed with his counsel\u2019s suggestion that he would never have gone to Dr. Feak had he known he was entitled to an oral E Card test. The Complainant did not enter Dr. Feak\u2019s report into evidence.\n[6] During the Respondent\u2019s cross-examination of the Complainant on January 18, 2016, the Respondent\u2019s counsel raised Dr. Feak\u2019s report with the Complainant, and asked him if there was something in Dr. Feak\u2019s report which he didn\u2019t agree with. The Complainant confirmed that there was and identified the specific finding with which he disagreed. Respondent\u2019s counsel went through one part of the report with the Complainant, and sought to have the report admitted into evidence as an exhibit. Complainant\u2019s counsel objected.\n[7] Complainant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection was on various grounds: the absence of Dr. Feak to testify about the report and be cross-examined on it; the fact that the report provides a lot of information not referred to in examination in chief and that information would not be clear to the Tribunal; admitting the report would put the Tribunal in the position of having to review a complex report; there is evidence in the report prejudicial to the Complainant; the report doesn\u2019t go into the root issues of the Complainant\u2019s ability to function; it is not relevant to the issues at hand as it does not deal with the practical issues in terms of the Complainant\u2019s occupation and certification requirements; and, it was improperly obtained and intrudes into the Complainant\u2019s privacy.\n[8] In response to the objections, the Respondent\u2019s counsel submitted that: the report was relevant to the Complaint\u2019s allegation that the Respondent failed to accommodate the Complainant; the Complainant discussed the report in examination in chief; the Respondent would be legally prejudiced if it was not permitted to question the Complainant about the report, which she submitted was part of the Respondent\u2019s accommodation process.\n[9] After hearing the parties\u2019 submissions, and a brief recess to consider the parties\u2019 submissions, my ruling was that Dr. Feak\u2019s report would be admitted as an exhibit, however, given that Dr. Feak could not be examined or cross-examined, that fact would go to the weight to be given to the document. I also ruled that the report would be subject to a confidentiality order.\n[10] The next set of hearing dates is from May 2 to 13, 2016 (\u201cMay hearing\u201d). It was anticipated that the Respondent would present and close its case, and the parties would make their closing submissions.\nII. Respondent\u2019s motion\n[11] On March 24, 2016, the Respondent made a motion (\u201cMotion\u201d) by way of Notice of Motion (\u201cNOM\u201d), for leave from the Tribunal, pursuant to Rule 9(3)(e), to permit\na) Dr. Marcus Feak to attend as an expert witness during the May hearing; and\nb) that Dr. Feak provide expert and opinion evidence based on his assessments of the Complainant conducted on January 26, February 2 and March 30, 2007, and on his report dated March 28, 2007 (Dr. Feak\u2019s report).\n[12] I note that Dr. Feak attached to his March 28, 2007 report a form from the Respondent\u2019s Occupational Health Services (\u201cOHS\u201d). The form\u2019s title is \u2018Medical report to be completed by the treating physician\u201d (\u201cOHS Medical Form\u201d or \u201cForm\u201d). The Form is dated March 30, 2007 and is signed by Dr. Feak. In answering the Form\u2019s question 8, Dr. Feak refers back to the \u201cAttached Report\u201d, being his longer report of March 28, 2007. Therefore, where this Ruling refers to Dr. Feak\u2019s report, it means both documents.\nGrounds for Respondent\u2019s Motion\n[13] The grounds for the Respondent\u2019s Motion are as follows:\nThe Respondent disclosed Dr. Feak\u2019s report to the Complainant in February, 2014 as part of its documentary disclosure accompanying its Statement of Particulars (SOP);\nDuring the Complainant\u2019s cross-examination on January 18, 2016, Dr. Feak\u2019s report was introduced into evidence as Respondent\u2019s exhibit R-1, tab 4;\nThe Complainant did not call any expert witnesses or any witnesses other than himself who spoke to his literacy and abilities as they related to taking a written examination;\nDr. Feak\u2019s assessment of the Complainant is about the Complainant\u2019s abilities and limitations regarding literacy and overall functioning in the workplace, and therefore his evidence is material and relevant to the main issues \u201carising from the hearing\u201d;\nCalling Dr. Feak to give evidence would not cause serious prejudice to the Complainant because:\n(i) Dr. Feak\u2019s report was disclosed in February, 2014, before the hearing;\n(ii) It has already been admitted into evidence during the hearing;\n(iii) Complainant counsel can cross-examine Dr. Feak;\n(iv) Complainant can call rebuttal evidence through other witnesses.\nSubsection 48.9(1) of the Act provides that proceedings be conducted in a way that balances speed with the principles of natural justice; and\nSubsection 50(1) of the Act provides that the Member or Panel must give all parties a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations.\nComplainant\u2019s Position\n[14] The Complainant opposes the Motion on the grounds set out below:\nThe Respondent has not complied with Rule 6(3) and filed a copy of Dr. Feak\u2019s report with the Tribunal;\nRule 9(3)(e) prohibits a party who has not complied with Rule 6(3) from introducing an expert report into evidence and calling the expert as a witness;\nDr. Feak\u2019s report was obtained under false pretences and should never have been done, because the Respondent\u2019s own RQS Manual, at exhibit C-4, tab 11 of Complainant\u2019s Document Book 1 sets out the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to oral D and E Card tests, and the Respondent and Complainant\u2019s then supervisor should have permitted the Complainant to take the oral tests in 2005;\nThe assessment itself was therefore prejudicial to the Complainant;\nThe assessments and report are also prejudicial because they are nine years old; were done during a period of extreme stress related to the Complainant\u2019s marital situation; and are not probative of the Complainant\u2019s present situation;\nThe Complainant had no counsel during 2007 when Dr. Feak made his assessments and wrote his report;\nDr. Feak\u2019s assessments and report are also irrelevant for the same reasons; the Respondent was \u201csomewhat reasonably\u201d accommodating the Complainant at the time, which continued for \u201cthe next almost 4 years until the end of 2010\u201d; and\nThe Complainant closed his case on March 3, 2016. He only knew that the Respondent planned to call Dr. Feak as an expert witness on March 24, 2016, and is thereby also prejudiced.\n[15] In its Reply to Complainant\u2019s Response to Motion (\u201cComplainant\u2019s Response\u201d or \u201cResponse\u201d), the Respondent further submitted that:\nThe Complainant\u2019s Response does not reveal any prejudice to the Complainant;\nAlternatively, the Complainant\u2019s Response did not address the remedies available to the Complainant if there is any prejudice in calling Dr. Feak \u2013 the remedies of cross-examination and calling rebuttal witnesses;\nThe Respondent served and filed Dr. Feak\u2019s report in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Rules of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (all together: Tribunal Rules; individually: Rule);\nThe statements in paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Complainant\u2019s Response regarding lack of counsel, the Complainant\u2019s mental state and timing of the assessment can go to the weight the Tribunal gives to Dr. Feak\u2019s Report and testimony;\nThe Complainant\u2019s statements in paragraph 3 and 4 of its Response, regarding the Respondent\u2019s 1991 RQS manual permitting oral testing are assertions only, because the Respondent has not yet presented evidence regarding the RQS or the Respondent\u2019s efforts to accommodate the Complainant;\nFurther, and notwithstanding the Complainant\u2019s statements regarding the RQS manual, which the Respondent denies, that information alone is not sufficient reason to deny the Respondent\u2019s motion to call Dr. Feak as an expert and adduce his testimony, in light of the contents of subsections 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act.\nIII. Issue\n[16] The issue in this Motion is whether the Tribunal should grant leave to permit the Respondent to call Dr. Marcus Feak as an expert witness to provide expert opinion evidence, including the document called \u201cDr. Feak\u2019s report\u201d in this Ruling.\nIV. Statute law and Tribunal Rules\n[17] Section 48.9(1) of the Act states:\nProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\nSubsection 50(1) of the Act states in part:\n\u2026the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties\u2026a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\nSubsection 50(3)(c) of the Act states:\nIn relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law.\nSubsections 50(4) and (5) disallow, respectively, the admittance or acceptance as evidence \u201c\u2026anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence\u201d and the calling or compelling of a conciliator appointed to settle a complaint as a witness at the hearing.\n[18] Rule 1(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cTribunal Rule(s)\u201d or \u201cRule(s)\u201d) states:\nThese Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\nRule 1(2) states:\nThese Rules shall be liberally applied by each Panel to the case before it so as to advance the purposes set out in 1(1).\nRule 6(3) states:\nWithin the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve on all other parties and file with the Tribunal,\n(a) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call, which report shall,\n(i) be signed by the expert;\n(ii) set out the expert\u2019s name, address and qualifications; and\n(iii) set out the substance of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony;and\n(b) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call in response to an expert\u2019s report filed under 6(3)(a), which report shall comply with the requirements of 6(3)(a).\nRule 9(3)(e) states:\nExcept with leave of the Panel, which leave shall be granted on such terms and conditions as accord with the purposes set out in 1(1), and subject to a party\u2019s right to lead evidence in reply,\u2026\n(e) a party who has not complied with 6(3) shall not introduce an expert report into evidence nor call an expert witness at the hearing.\nAnalysis\n[19] In order to determine whether to grant the leave the Respondent seeks, I find that a consideration of the following issues is necessary at this stage of the proceeding:\n1) To what extent has the Respondent complied with Rule 6(3)?;\n2) Where there has been non-compliance, to what extent has it caused prejudice to the Complainant?; and\n3) Is any such prejudice curable?\n1) To what extent has the Respondent complied with Rule 6(3)?\n[20] Rule 6(3) is of particular importance to this Motion because it sets out a specific procedure for the calling of expert witnesses. The Rule differs from the general Rules governing the calling of non-expert witnesses. Rule 6(3) requires that the party:\nstate that the party is tendering the individual as an expert;\nserve on the other parties and file with the Tribunal \u201ca report in respect of the expert witness the party intends to call\u201d;\ninclude in the report, the expert\u2019s qualifications, and the substance of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony; and\ncomply with the same rule where a party wishes to file a responding expert\u2019s report in respect of any expert witness which the opposite party intends to call [italics mine].\n[21] The Complainant closed his case on March 3, 2016.\n[22] The usual procedure in accordance with Rule 6(3) entails that a party who wishes to tender an expert witness will notify the Tribunal and the other parties. The Tribunal will then fix a time for the initiating party to serve and file an expert report in sufficient time to allow the other party or parties, if they choose, to retain their own responding expert witness and serve and file their own responding expert report, again \u201c[w]ithin the time fixed by the Panel\u201d, as stated in Rule 6(3). Ideally, this all occurs well before the hearing starts.\n[23] There is no dispute that the Respondent disclosed Dr. Feak\u2019s report in February 2014, as part of the disclosure of documents accompanying its Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d), though the Respondent did not file the Report with the Tribunal, as required by Rule 6(3). Also, Dr. Feak\u2019s report was admitted into evidence during the cross-examination of the Complainant, in the circumstances described above.\n[24] While the Complainant objected to the admission of Dr. Feak\u2019s report as an exhibit, it is noteworthy that his objections were not based on alleged non-compliance with Rule 6(3). This is most likely because, at that time, the report was neither tendered into evidence nor admitted as being an expert report [italics mine].\n[25] Therefore, while Dr. Feak\u2019s report was disclosed and admitted into evidence, it was not served, filed or tendered into evidence as an expert report in accordance with Rule 6(3). Also, the Respondent did not notify the parties or the Tribunal that it wished to treat Dr. Feak\u2019s report as such, or that it wished to call Dr. Feak to give expert opinion evidence until its March 24, 2016 Notice of Motion \u2013 brought less than 6 weeks before the resumption of the May hearing, and 3 weeks after the Complainant closed his case.\n[26] The Respondent has also not included Dr. Feak\u2019s qualifications in his report, as required by Rule 6(3)(a)(ii).\n[27] Taking into account all of the above with respect to Rule 6(3) and what the Respondent did and did not do, I conclude that the Respondent did not comply with the Rule.\n2) Where there has been non-compliance with Rule 6(3), to what extent has it caused prejudice to the Complainant?\n[28] I find that the Complainant\u2019s submission that Dr. Feak\u2019s report is in and of itself prejudicial to the Complainant and should never have been done in the first place is a submission going to the merits of the report. It would be premature at this stage for the Tribunal to make a finding on this submission.\n[29] I conclude that because the Respondent did not comply with Rule 6(3), and only notified the Complainant on March 24, 2016 that it intended to seek leave to treat Dr. Feak\u2019s report as an expert report and permit Dr. Feak to testify as an expert witness, the Complainant has not had a reasonable opportunity to obtain his own responding expert report and witness, as Rule 6(3)(b) entitles him to do.\n[30] He has also been deprived of the opportunity to arrange for other rebuttal witnesses. It is possible that he and his counsel may in fact decide not to do so, but the Respondent has effectively deprived the Complainant of the opportunity to do so before the Complainant closed his case.\n[31] Therefore, I conclude that to the extent that the Complainant has been deprived of the opportunity to respond pre-emptively to Dr. Feak\u2019s expert opinion evidence by way of the Complainant\u2019s own expert or other witnesses, the Complainant has been prejudiced.\n[32] That said, there are a number of considerations that tend to diminish the prejudice incurred by the Complainant.\n[33] In paragraph 22 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP dated December 17, 2013, the Complainant states that Dennis Curtis had the Complainant attend for a psychological assessment in 2007 and that this resulted in Dr. Feak\u2019s assessing the Complainant and rendering his report.\n[34] Paragraph 22 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP also quotes two portions of Dr. Feak\u2019s report in support of one of the remedies the Complainant seeks \u2013 namely, that he be permitted to take the D Card test orally.\n[35] The Complainant disclosed Dr. Feak\u2019s report in his own documentary disclosure attached to his SOP (at para. 22). As set out above, the Complainant also testified about the report in direct examination. Thus, Dr. Feak\u2019s report is a part of the narrative of the Complainant\u2019s case.\n[36] The Respondent\u2019s SOP also describes or refers to Dr. Feak\u2019s report - in paragraphs 61, 64, 79, 94, 95 and 96. I find that Dr. Feak\u2019s report is also a part of the narrative of the Respondent\u2019s case, and the Complainant has known this from the time he was served with the Respondent\u2019s SOP.\n[37] On the basis of the foregoing, one can conclude that the Complainant\u2019s reading and writing abilities, and how they impact his capability of doing the work he desires, are issues in this Complaint.\n[38] Dr. Feak\u2019s report discusses those same issues, and has been known to the Complainant for some time.\n[39] In assessing the prejudice to the Complainant, I also take into account the Complainant\u2019s submissions in his Response to Motion that the report is 9 years old, that it was done when the Complainant did not have counsel and when he was under a great deal of personal stress. Those factors may go to the weight that is ultimately attributed to Dr. Feak\u2019s report.\n[40] Moreover, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the report has already been introduced into evidence during the cross-examination of the Complainant. At the time I admitted it, I found that it was relevant to the Complaint for the purposes for which it was originally tendered.\n[41] On the whole, I am convinced that the Complainant incurs significant prejudice from the Respondent\u2019s non-compliance with Rule 6(3), and from the timing of the Respondent\u2019s Motion, but it is not on the scale of the prejudice suffered where a party is truly subjected to \u201ctrial by ambush.\u201d One cannot contend in the current case that the prospective expert evidence comes as complete surprise, i.e., that there was absolutely no notice given (constructive or otherwise) that this expert opinion evidence even existed, and that none of it had thus far been adduced into the record in any form.\n[42] I note that the Respondent does not dispute the Complainant\u2019s right to call rebuttal witnesses.\n[43] I now turn to the question of to what extent the prejudice is curable.\n3) Is any such prejudice repairable?\n[44] I have concluded that the Complainant has been prejudiced. Balanced against the Respondent\u2019s right to be given a full and ample opportunity to present its case is the Complainant\u2019s right, if Dr. Feak\u2019s expert opinion evidence is admitted, to also be given a full and ample opportunity to present evidence in response to Dr. Feak\u2019s evidence, and make representations about it.\n[45] Rule 9(3) provides the Tribunal with wide latitude in crafting a remedy to negate any prejudice to the other party if the Member or Panel grants leave to a party who has not complied with Rule 6(3). The Member or Panel can grant leave \u201con such terms and conditions as accord with the purposes set out in 1(1).\u201d\n[46] I conclude that, if he wishes to have one, an adjournment for a meaningful and reasonable amount of time would put the Complainant in the same position he would have been in had the Respondent provided the proper notice regarding Dr. Feak. This would give him the opportunity to arrange for his own expert report and witness, if he wished to do so, or to call other witnesses and evidence in rebuttal to Dr. Feak\u2019s report and testimony.\n[47] It is not necessary that the entirety of the May 2\u201313, 2016 hearing dates be adjourned in order to fully deal with this issue. That would not be in the interests of either of the parties who both wish this hearing to proceed on those dates.\n[48] The Respondent has provided a proposed schedule for the May hearing, which includes the dates on which it would call its own witnesses. For the 8th day of the May hearing, after all its own witnesses have been called but before final submissions, the Respondent has proposed \u201cPossible Rebuttal Evidence.\u201d I assume that this day is proposed as the time for the Complainant to call his expert witness in response, or witnesses in rebuttal, to Dr. Feak\u2019s report and testimony.\n[49] I find it is reasonable to assume that the Complainant and his counsel will be occupied with the ongoing hearing for the 7 days prior to the 8th day. Therefore, the timetable the Respondent proposes does not allow for a reasonable amount of time for the Complainant to be able to muster an expert or other witness in rebuttal, if the Complainant and his counsel decide to do so.\n[50] If Dr. Feak is qualified as an expert witness, and the Complainant wishes to present expert or other evidence and witnesses in response to Dr. Feak\u2019s report and testimony, the Complainant would be entitled to an adjournment, after the Respondent has presented all its witnesses, the terms of which I will decide after hearing the submissions from the parties. In other words, all of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses will testify in chief and be cross-examined, with re-direct examination as necessary. By then, the Complainant would have had sufficient time to decide if he requires the adjournment, and both parties could make submissions on the adjournment\u2019s terms.\n[51] It will be apparent from a reading of the above reasons that they do not fully dispose of the Respondent\u2019s motion or the parties\u2019 arguments. This is because it is extremely difficult to fully address all objections to proposed expert testimony prior to the actual proffering of the expert witness (see in this regard FNCFCS v. AGC, 2012 CHRT 28). Rule 3 indicates that a Tribunal Member seized with a motion may direct the making of argument and the presentation of evidence, including the time, manner and form thereof, and dispose of the motion as he or she sees fit.\n[52] In the present ruling, I have addressed the issue of prejudice flowing from non-compliance with Rule 6(3), and have decided that it is not a bar to the relief sought by the Respondent. However, that is not the end of the matter. The remaining issues relating to the admissibility of Dr. Feak\u2019s expert opinion testimony, including those related to his report, will be addressed at the May hearing. In my order below, I have issued a direction as to the Respondent\u2019s filing obligation, and as to the procedure I intend to follow when the hearing resumes. Only once all issues have been examined will I be able to make a final determination of whether to grant leave under Rule 9(3) permitting Dr. Feak to testify as an expert witness.\nV. Order\n[53] The Respondent shall, no later than April 29, 2016, provide to the parties, in writing, and file with the Tribunal, a statement of Dr. Feak\u2019s qualifications, in compliance with Rule 6(3)(a)(ii) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04).\n[54] During the hearing scheduled to begin on May 2, 2016, the Respondent may proffer Dr. Marcus Feak for qualification as an expert witness and the Complainant may cross-examine Dr. Feak and make submissions on: (i) whether Dr. Feak should be qualified as an expert witness; and (ii) the general admissibility of his proposed testimony.\n[55] The Tribunal shall then decide whether to qualify Dr. Feak as an expert witness.\n[56] If the Tribunal decides to qualify Dr. Feak as an expert witness, the following procedure will apply: after all of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses have testified, and before any closing submissions, the Complainant shall have the opportunity to adduce reply evidence in relation to Dr. Feak\u2019s report and testimony. The Complainant may request an adjournment for this purpose, the terms of which the Tribunal shall rule upon, after hearing from all parties. Regardless of whether an adjournment is sought, any reply evidence the Complainant may choose to present will be subject to the requirements of Rule 6.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 25, 2016\n",

D\u00e9cision 13\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision concerne une requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Barbara Barrie (la plaignante) visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance de r\u00e9ouverture de la proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 deux plaintes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal. Mme Barrie \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (la SCP) et elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre la SCP et son syndicat, l\u2019Association des officiers des postes du Canada (l\u2019AOPC). En janvier 2015, Mme Barrie a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation conduite par un membre du Tribunal. Elle a accept\u00e9 une offre des intim\u00e9es, et le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 en temps opportun par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP ou la Commission), aux termes de l\u2019article 48 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (LCDP). Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de la CCDP selon lequel elle avait approuv\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s-verbal de r\u00e8glement, le Tribunal a clos ses dossiers.\n[2] Mme Barrie agit pour son propre compte, et sa requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas aussi claire qu\u2019elle pourrait l\u2019\u00eatre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e. Dans la requ\u00eate, elle demande d\u2019\u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement \u2018\u2019obligatoire\u2019\u2019 [...] \u00bb; elle demande en outre une ordonnance de compensation p\u00e9cuniaire semblable \u00e0 la demande formul\u00e9e dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Je comprends qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une demande voulant que le Tribunal en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le r\u00e8glement soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant nul et non avenu, au vu des circonstances entourant sa n\u00e9gociation, qui sont expliqu\u00e9es dans sa requ\u00eate, et que l\u2019affaire donne lieu \u00e0 une instruction.\n[3] Dans sa r\u00e9plique aux observations des autres parties, Mme Barrie semble modifier sa requ\u00eate en demandant, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que les parties soient tenues de retourner en m\u00e9diation pour ren\u00e9gocier :\n[traduction]\nCompte tenu de la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie dans Cawson c. Air Canada, sur laquelle se fondent les intim\u00e9es, si le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour annuler le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9, il devrait avoir comp\u00e9tence pour renvoyer les parties en m\u00e9diation afin de ren\u00e9gocier les questions en litige.\n[4] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate visant la r\u00e9ouverture du dossier.\nI. La confidentialit\u00e9\n[5] Le Tribunal ne peut admettre en preuve des renseignements confidentiels en raison du paragraphe 50(4) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements prot\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement contre la divulgation et rend inadmissibles les modalit\u00e9s du r\u00e8glement. Toutefois, dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal devra tenir compte d\u2019une modalit\u00e9 en particulier du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9plique de Mme Barrie. Cette derni\u00e8re a divulgu\u00e9 ce qui semble \u00eatre une modalit\u00e9 type utilis\u00e9e normalement dans le mod\u00e8le relatif au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate de la plaignante contestait le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 d\u2019un r\u00e8glement final, et l\u2019existence ou la port\u00e9e de celui-ci, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 et examin\u00e9 le texte de cette modalit\u00e9 type, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information au sujet du processus de r\u00e8glement, conform\u00e9ment aux exceptions au privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements (Sable Offshore Energy Inc. c. Ameron International Corp., 2013 CSC 37, au paragraphe 19; Union Carbide Canada Inc. c. Bombardier Inc., 2014 CSC 35, au paragraphe 35.) La modalit\u00e9 type de m\u00eame que certains autres faits relatifs au processus de r\u00e8glement seront \u00e9galement abord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[6] Outre ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Commission, l\u2019AOPC et la SCP ont toutes demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres modalit\u00e9s du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement, et je constate que la m\u00e9diation elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par un accord de confidentialit\u00e9 auquel ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9es toutes les parties. Ainsi, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 tous les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par suite de la requ\u00eate de Mme Barrie, le Tribunal ordonne, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, qu\u2019ils soient trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on confidentielle et il ordonne que les parties ne divulguent pas les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s ou re\u00e7us par suite de la requ\u00eate de Mme Barrie, sauf dans le cas d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en vertu de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\nII. Le contexte\n[7] Les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la plaignante aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, le 29 avril 2013. Le 26 mars 2014, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire les plaintes. La premi\u00e8re plainte vise la SCP; elle est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, et elle all\u00e8gue une discrimination suivant les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. La seconde plainte vise l\u2019AOPC; elle est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, et elle all\u00e8gue une discrimination suivant les articles 9 et 10 de la LCDP. La Commission a demand\u00e9 une instruction commune pour les deux plaintes.\n[8] Les parties ont finalement convenu d\u2019une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation volontaire men\u00e9e par un membre du Tribunal. Lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, Mme Barrie a accept\u00e9 une offre des intim\u00e9es. Un proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Mme Barrie et les intim\u00e9es. Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48(1) de la LCDP, des copies du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 la CCDP aux fins d\u2019approbation ou de rejet.\n[9] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Barrie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, elle s\u2019est vu accorder un d\u00e9lai de [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9flexion \u00bb de sept jours pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 l\u2019entente. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pratique tout \u00e0 fait normale pour le Tribunal de permettre aux parties non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette p\u00e9riode afin d\u2019examiner attentivement l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement et d\u2019obtenir des conseils juridiques si elles d\u00e9cident de le faire. Les parties non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es peuvent retirer leur consentement \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du d\u00e9lai de sept jours. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Barrie a profit\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai pour poser d\u2019autres questions aux intim\u00e9es et la SCP lui a r\u00e9pondu. Le 23 janvier 2015, soit sept jours apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, Mme Barrie a avis\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019elle consentait toujours au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du r\u00e8glement.\n[10] Le ou vers le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2015, Mme Barrie a avis\u00e9 la Commission qu\u2019elle avait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle n\u2019approuvait plus l\u2019entente expos\u00e9e dans le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a avis\u00e9 les autres parties que Mme Barrie avait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e.\n[11] Le 17 mars 2015, le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance avec toutes les parties. Lors de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a inform\u00e9 les autres parties que le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la CCDP aux fins d\u2019approbation ou de rejet, mais qu\u2019il (l\u2019avocat de la Commission) avait retir\u00e9 depuis le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal qui ne fera pas l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen, apr\u00e8s avoir appris que Mme Barrie avait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e.\n[12] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 27 mars 2015, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a propos\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es de pr\u00e9senter leurs positions respectives, \u00e0 savoir si les modalit\u00e9s du r\u00e8glement devaient \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le retrait de l\u2019entente de Mme Barrie. Les intim\u00e9es ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019invitation \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations et ont insist\u00e9 pour que le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement soit soumis aussit\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019approbation du pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim.\n[13] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 juillet 2015, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que le 6 mai 2015, la Commission avait approuv\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement et que les parties en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es le 20 mai 2015. Par la suite, selon sa pratique habituelle, le Tribunal a clos son dossier, et les parties en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es par \u00e9crit, le 27 juillet 2015. Le 10 ao\u00fbt 2015, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nIII. Les questions en litige\nLe tribunal a\u2011t\u2011il comp\u00e9tence pour trancher un diff\u00e9rend relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission au titre de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP?\nSi le tribunal a comp\u00e9tence, Mme Barrie a\u2011t\u2011elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant nul et non avenu, au motif que, selon ses observations :\na) elle avait agi sous la contrainte;\nb) les intim\u00e9es avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inexacte les faits et avaient n\u00e9goci\u00e9 de mauvaise foi dans le cadre de la m\u00e9diation;\nc) elle avait avis\u00e9 les autres parties qu\u2019elle avait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e 23 jours seulement apr\u00e8s la signature du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement.\nIV. Analyse\nA. La comp\u00e9tence\n[14] Puisque la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question dans les observations de la Commission, de la SCP et de l\u2019AOPC, j\u2019aborderai d\u2019abord cette question. La Commission et les intim\u00e9es ont toutes fait valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour rouvrir les plaintes de Mme Barrie en se fondant sur la r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cawson c. Air Canada, 2015 TCDP 17. Dans cette affaire, le plaignant avait demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un dossier de plainte qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 quelque temps auparavant au moyen du processus de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal.\n[15] Bien que le Tribunal ne dispose pas d\u2019un mandat statutaire explicite de recourir \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation, une m\u00e9diation est propos\u00e9e aux parties sur une base volontaire en vue de les aider \u00e0 trouver une conclusion mutuellement satisfaisante \u00e0 l\u2019affaire; la m\u00e9diation constitue par ailleurs une solution de rechange au processus d\u2019audience g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus long, plus co\u00fbteux et plus formel. Pour guider le processus de m\u00e9diation, le Tribunal demande \u00e0 toutes les parties de signer une entente de m\u00e9diation avant le d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation et les parties non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sont \u00e9galement inform\u00e9es de la r\u00e8gle relative \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9flexion de sept jours.\n[16] La LCDP tient compte express\u00e9ment de la possibilit\u00e9 de parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement avant le d\u00e9but d\u2019une audience du Tribunal :\n48. (1) Les parties qui conviennent d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, mais avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience d\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne, en pr\u00e9sentent les conditions \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission.\n(2) Dans le cas pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission certifie sa d\u00e9cision et la communique aux parties.\n(3) Le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie ou de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de cette juridiction et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle.\n[17] Le Tribunal a tenu compte de l\u2019article 48 dans l\u2019affaire Powell c. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., 2008 TCDP 43, o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutenait que le Tribunal devrait clore son dossier parce que, \u00e0 son avis, un r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019article 48 influait sur l\u2019instruction du Tribunal. Au paragraphe 10, il a fait observer ce qui suit :\nRien n\u2019indique que la Commission a express\u00e9ment ou tacitement approuv\u00e9 le pr\u00e9tendu r\u00e8glement conclu entre Mme Powell et UPS. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de cette approbation, on ne peut pas affirmer qu\u2019il existe un r\u00e8glement qui met fin \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal sur la plainte.\n[18] Dans l\u2019affaire Cawson, le Tribunal avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de l\u2019approbation par la Commission du r\u00e8glement conclu entre les parties. Au paragraphe 24 de l\u2019affaire, le vice\u2011pr\u00e9sident Gupta a ainsi \u00e9largi le sens de l\u2019article 48 :\n[traduction]\nSous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019approuver les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019un r\u00e8glement a pour effet de mettre un terme \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il s\u2019agit \u00e9galement d\u2019une d\u00e9cision qui est susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (voir, par exemple, Johnson c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CF 1021). Le paragraphe 48(3) permet en outre \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de r\u00e9gler les diff\u00e9rends sur des ententes de r\u00e8glement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, une fois qu\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019a plus comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui fait l\u2019objet du r\u00e8glement; il n\u2019a pas non plus comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler les diff\u00e9rends li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[19] Il est raisonnable pour les parties de compter sur le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement conclue. S\u2019il ne pouvait y avoir aucune garantie du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, les parties ne seraient pas incit\u00e9es \u00e0 prendre part au processus de m\u00e9diation. Je souscris \u00e9galement \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cawson, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019une fois que la Commission a approuv\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement au titre de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019a plus comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte. Bien que je ne m\u2019appuie pas sur la r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 1180, je tiens \u00e0 souligner que la conclusion susmentionn\u00e9e est conforme \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\n[20] La question du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif et le r\u00f4le du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont malheureusement formul\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re quelque peu ambigu\u00eb dans le contexte du paragraphe 9 du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9 par Mme Barrie et les intim\u00e9es. Dans sa r\u00e9plique aux observations de la Commission et des intim\u00e9es au sujet de sa requ\u00eate, Mme Barrie a communiqu\u00e9 une partie de ce paragraphe. Selon sa r\u00e9plique, elle estime que le paragraphe 9 lui donne [traduction] \u00ab le droit de rouvrir l\u2019entente ou de recourir \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation \u00bb. Elle soutient que, si le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour annuler le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement, il a comp\u00e9tence pour renvoyer les parties en m\u00e9diation afin de n\u00e9gocier les questions en litige.\n[21] Dans un souci de clart\u00e9, l'avocat de la SCP a communiqu\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement le paragraphe que j\u2019ai reproduit ci\u2011dessous. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, j\u2019ai admis et accept\u00e9 cette information conform\u00e9ment aux exceptions au privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements; il s\u2019agit de la seule disposition du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement qui n\u2019est pas r\u00e9gie par l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 en ce qui concerne les modalit\u00e9s du r\u00e8glement. Le paragraphe 9 est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\n9. Une fois que le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, dans le cas d\u2019un d\u00e9saccord relativement \u00e0 l\u2019application appropri\u00e9e de l\u2019une ou de plusieurs des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente, les parties conviennent de reprendre la m\u00e9diation pour ren\u00e9gocier les questions en litige. Elles conviennent en outre que les modifications seront soumises \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et ces modifications seront susceptibles d\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que l\u2019entente initiale.\n[22] Le Tribunal n\u2019est jamais une partie au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019une de ses s\u00e9ances de m\u00e9diation. En outre, les membres du Tribunal ne sont pas du tout tenus de participer \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de ce proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal. Ils ne demandent ni ne conservent une copie de celui\u2011ci.\n[23] La disponibilit\u00e9 des services de m\u00e9diation fournis par les m\u00e9diateurs qui sont membres du TCDP est une question relevant du r\u00f4le de gestionnaire et de d\u00e9cideur du pr\u00e9sident du TCDP (voir le paragraphe 48.4(2) de la LCDP; TCDP, Rapport annuel 2000, p. 2, 3 et 5). Les documents explicatifs du Tribunal qui d\u00e9taillent les proc\u00e9dures de m\u00e9diation indiquent que, si une entente est conclue lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation et qu\u2019elle est approuv\u00e9e par la Commission, \u00ab il est mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019instance \u00bb (Voir TCDP, Proc\u00e9dures de m\u00e9diation \u00e9valuative, 10 d\u00e9cembre 2010, p. 9; TCDP, Guide explicatif du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, p. 21 [1] ).\n[24] En outre, \u00e0 deux reprises (affaires Powell et Cawson), le Tribunal a fait observer que l\u2019approbation d'un r\u00e8glement au titre de l'article 48 prive le Tribunal de sa comp\u00e9tence pour instruire une plainte. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019ajout d\u2019une clause [traduction] \u00ab retour en m\u00e9diation \u00bb, comme le paragraphe 9 ci\u2011dessus, pourrait poser des probl\u00e8mes. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il sugg\u00e8re aux parties qu\u2019une m\u00e9diation ult\u00e9rieure tenue par un membre du Tribunal est offerte ind\u00e9finiment pour r\u00e9gler tout litige ult\u00e9rieur dans l\u2019affaire qui d\u00e9coule du r\u00e8glement, une telle clause ne tient pas enti\u00e8rement compte du r\u00f4le et des responsabilit\u00e9s du pr\u00e9sident du TCDP ainsi que des proc\u00e9dures de m\u00e9diation ou de la jurisprudence du Tribunal. Pour tous les motifs ci\u2011dessus, je conclus que le paragraphe 9 du proc\u00e8s-verbal de r\u00e8glement ne donne pas le droit \u00e0 Mme Barry de rouvrir l\u2019entente ou de recourir \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation.\nB. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement est\u2011il nul et non avenu?\n[25] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019examiner la deuxi\u00e8me question relative \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 des contrats en cas de contrainte, de fausses d\u00e9clarations, de mauvaise foi et de retrait rapide d\u2019un consentement. N\u00e9anmoins, les all\u00e9gations seront examin\u00e9es ci\u2011apr\u00e8s dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il serait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate.\n(i) La contrainte\n[26] Mme Barrie a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les renseignements erron\u00e9s lui donnaient la nette impression qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre [traduction] \u00ab solution r\u00e9aliste \u00bb et qu\u2019elle devait donc renoncer \u00e0 sa plainte et signer l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Elle voyait ces renseignements erron\u00e9s comme un [traduction] \u00ab genre de contrainte \u00bb. Le seuil, sur le plan juridique, pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la contrainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Taber c. Paris Boutique & Bridal Inc., 2010 ONCA 57, aux paragraphes 8 et 9 :\n[traduction]\nIl ne fait aucun doute que les contraintes \u00e9conomiques peuvent servir \u00e0 rendre une entente inopposable \u00e0 une partie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue par la contrainte d\u2019y souscrire. Il ne fait non plus aucun doute que la partie peut faire d\u00e9clarer l\u2019entente nulle.\nToutefois, ce ne sont pas toutes les formes de pression, \u00e9conomique ou autre, qui constituent de la contrainte \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 tel que cela entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences sur le plan juridique. Deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents : ce doit \u00eatre une forme de pression que la loi consid\u00e8re comme ill\u00e9gale, et elle doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e au point qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab coercition exerc\u00e9e sur la volont\u00e9 \u00bb de la partie qui invoque ce concept [\u2026]\n[27] Mme Barrie n\u2019a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aucun fait \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son affirmation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e d\u2019agir contre sa volont\u00e9 lors de la m\u00e9diation. Selon les observations de la SCP, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans des pi\u00e8ces s\u00e9par\u00e9es tout au long de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. En outre, et sans doute le point le plus important, Mme Barrie a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de sept jours au cours duquel elle a pu r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. M\u00eame si elle se sentait soumise \u00e0 des pressions au moment de la s\u00e9ance, elle aurait eu suffisamment de temps dans les jours suivants pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la question de savoir si oui ou non elle souhaitait vraiment r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire. C\u2019est pourquoi je ne peux conclure que Mme Barrie satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Taber, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\n[28] En outre, Mme Barrie a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre [traduction] \u00ab solution r\u00e9aliste \u00bb, si ce n\u2019est celle de renoncer \u00e0 sa plainte et de signer le proc\u00e8s-verbal de r\u00e8glement. Elle semble se fonder sur un commentaire pr\u00e9tendu du m\u00e9diateur, selon lequel il n\u2019y aurait aucune garantie quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal si l\u2019affaire devait \u00eatre instruite. Toutefois, Mme Barrie ne va pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire que le m\u00e9diateur l\u2019avait avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle obtiendrait moins que ce qui lui \u00e9tait offert par voie de m\u00e9diation. Les membres du Tribunal se font parfois demander une \u00e9valuation des perspectives d\u2019une partie, si la m\u00e9diation devait \u00e9chouer et que l\u2019affaire doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une audience. Il est implicite, bien que ce ne soit pas mentionn\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on explicite toutes les fois par le membre, que son \u00e9valuation est hypoth\u00e9tique et ne garantit pas l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction. En effet, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Barrie n\u2019insinue pas qu\u2019un r\u00e9sultat pr\u00e9cis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9dit, mais simplement que rien ne pouvait \u00eatre garanti. Dans ce contexte, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 son affirmation selon laquelle il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre solution r\u00e9aliste. Elle aurait pu tout simplement d\u00e9cliner l'offre et faire entendre sa plainte dans le cadre d\u2019une audience devant le TCDP.\n(ii) Les fausses d\u00e9clarations\/la mauvaise foi\n[29] Mme Barrie all\u00e8gue que les intim\u00e9es ne lui ont pas dit [traduction] \u00ab toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation et qu\u2019ainsi, elles ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inexacte les faits et n\u00e9goci\u00e9 de mauvaise foi. Elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Wedderburn c. Air Liquide Canada, 2010 HRTO 691, pour soutenir la pr\u00e9misse selon laquelle un contrat peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019une partie a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment tromp\u00e9 l\u2019autre pour l\u2019inciter \u00e0 conclure l\u2019entente.\n[30] Les intim\u00e9es font \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Wedderburn, parce que celle\u2011ci est fond\u00e9e sur le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1018429 Ontario Inc. c. Fea Investments Ltd., 1999 CanLII 1741 (CA ON). Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur la question de l\u2019assertion frauduleuse et inexacte et, au paragraphe 51, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019explication de cette notion donn\u00e9e par le professeur Friedman dans The Law of Contract in Canada, 3e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Carswell, 1994) \u00e0 la page 294 :\n[traduction]\nUne assertion frauduleuse et inexacte est celle qui est faite en sachant qu\u2019elle est fausse et dans l\u2019intention de tromper. Elle peut m\u00eame faire partie d\u2019une disposition du contrat. Que ce soit le cas ou non est sans importance, puisque la fraude a des r\u00e9percussions sur le droit contractuel et le droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle. Le contrat dont la conclusion r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une fausse repr\u00e9sentation frauduleuse peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 par la victime de la fraude. Dans un tel cas, le consentement apparent de la partie innocente n\u2019est pas un consentement v\u00e9ritable. Il importe peu que la cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une telle fraude soit d\u2019entra\u00eener ou non une erreur (ce qui pourrait entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 du contrat), le consentement de la victime de la fraude peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 si elle le d\u00e9sire.\n[31] Dans cette affaire, la question en litige \u00e9tait de savoir si une clause de non\u2011responsabilit\u00e9 inexacte dans un contrat pouvait exempter une partie du versement de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour assertion frauduleuse et inexacte. Cela ne constitue pas la principale pr\u00e9occupation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cependant, \u00e0 la page suivante de son texte, soit \u00e0 la page 295, le professeur Fridman donne une explication pr\u00e9cise d\u2019une assertion frauduleuse et inexacte en \u00e9non\u00e7ant ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels :\n[traduction]\nUne all\u00e9gation mensong\u00e8re est une d\u00e9claration de fait formul\u00e9e sans que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 croit \u00e0 sa v\u00e9racit\u00e9, de sorte que cette assertion incite son interlocuteur \u00e0 s'y fier pour agir en cons\u00e9quence, et am\u00e8ne effectivement cet interlocuteur \u00e0 agir en cons\u00e9quence. Dans l\u2019affaire United Shoe Machinery Co. c. Brunet (1909 A.C. 330 (P.C.)), les d\u00e9fendeurs voulaient invoquer comme moyen de d\u00e9fense l\u2019assertion frauduleuse et inexacte en vue d\u2019une action en injonction et en dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats fond\u00e9e sur un contrat aux termes duquel les demandeurs avaient lou\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fendeurs des machines pour ex\u00e9cuter un certain proc\u00e9d\u00e9 lors de la fabrication de chaussures. En fait, le Conseil priv\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs ne pouvaient pas invoquer ce moyen de d\u00e9fense, parce qu\u2019ils avaient adopt\u00e9 et confirm\u00e9 le contrat en d\u00e9pit d\u2019assertions frauduleuses et inexactes. En concluant qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et qu\u2019elle aurait fonctionn\u00e9 n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 du comportement ult\u00e9rieur des d\u00e9fendeurs, Lord Atkinson a indiqu\u00e9 clairement que, pour d\u00e9montrer un cas d\u2019assertions frauduleuses ou fausses et inexactes, il fallait \u00e9tablir ce qui suit : 1) que les d\u00e9clarations faisant l\u2019objet de plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par l\u2019auteur de tort \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la victime; 2) que ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient fausses en fait; 3) que l\u2019auteur du tort, lorsqu\u2019il les a faites, savait qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient fausses ou qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites avec insouciance, sans savoir si elles \u00e9taient vraies ou fausses; 4) que la victime avait \u00e9t\u00e9, de ce fait, incit\u00e9e \u00e0 la passation du contrat en question.\nVoir aussi : Westwood Shipping Lines Inc. c. Geo International Inc., 1999 CanLII 7652 (CF), au paragraphe 10).\n[32] Je conclus que le crit\u00e8re en quatre points de Lord Atkinson peut \u00eatre utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re, les intim\u00e9es ont fait valoir que l\u2019information contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait un expos\u00e9 de leur position juridique, et non une affirmation. Cependant, je ne suis pas tenu d\u2019aborder cette question, ni la troisi\u00e8me ou la quatri\u00e8me condition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans le crit\u00e8re.\n[33] Cet argument n\u2019est pas retenu, parce que Mme Barrie ne pr\u00e9tend pas que la fausse information all\u00e9gu\u00e9e lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement communiqu\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es. Selon les observations de celles\u2011ci, les parties n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation et, apparemment, elles ne se sont pas parl\u00e9 directement. Mme Barrie pr\u00e9tend que les intim\u00e9es ont communiqu\u00e9 certains renseignements erron\u00e9s au m\u00e9diateur du Tribunal qui les lui a ensuite relay\u00e9s, amenant ainsi la plaignante \u00e0 donner son consentement. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de communication directe entre Mme Barrie et les intim\u00e9es au cours de la m\u00e9diation. Celles\u2011ci nient avoir fait la d\u00e9claration en question, et Mme Barrie n\u2019a pas personnellement entendu dire qu\u2019elles l\u2019avaient vraiment faite. En outre, il se peut bien qu\u2019il y ait eu une erreur ou un malentendu dans la transmission verbale de l\u2019information par le m\u00e9diateur. Les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Barrie ne peuvent pas \u00e9tayer une conclusion d\u2019assertion frauduleuse et inexacte selon le crit\u00e8re de Lord Atkinson.\n(iii) Le retrait rapide\n[34] En relisant l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l'AOPC, le ou vers le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2015, Mme Barrie s\u2019est rendu compte que, lors de la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, elle en \u00e9tait venue \u00e0 croire \u00e0 un \u00e9tat de fait qui n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas vrai. Elle a aussit\u00f4t communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission pour retirer son consentement aux modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[35] Le 23 janvier 2015 \u00e9tait la date limite qui lui permettait de retirer son consentement. Mme Barrie \u00e9tait bien inform\u00e9e de la date limite et avait utilis\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9flexion de sept jours pour poser d\u2019autres questions aux intim\u00e9es. Le septi\u00e8me jour suivant la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, elle a avis\u00e9 toutes les parties qu\u2019elle souscrivait au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation.\n[36] Il est regrettable que Mme Barrie n\u2019ait pas compl\u00e8tement assimil\u00e9 les renseignements contenus dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019AOPC avant le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2015. Si elle s\u2019en \u00e9tait rendu compte plus t\u00f4t, elle aurait tr\u00e8s bien pu retirer son consentement aux modalit\u00e9s du r\u00e8glement ou ne pas accepter d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu le r\u00e8glement. Toutefois, le fait qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 un retrait imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e ne constitue pas un motif d\u2019annulation du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement.\n[37] Le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif est l\u2019une des garanties essentielles d\u2019un r\u00e8glement obtenu par voie de m\u00e9diation. Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement avis\u00e9es du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9flexion de sept jours, et Mme Barrie ne le conteste pas. Si le Tribunal devait ne pas tenir compte du caract\u00e8re p\u00e9remptoire du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9flexion de sept jours pour les motifs invoqu\u00e9s dans ce cas\u2011ci, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de son processus de m\u00e9diation au complet serait remise en question.\nV.

Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 TCDP 2 (la d\u00e9cision), ce Tribunal a conclu que les plaignants avaient \u00e9tabli le bien-fond\u00e9 de leur plainte selon laquelle les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon se voient refuser l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille ou sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s \u00e0 l'occasion de la prestation de services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, en violation de l'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, maintenant Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada (AANC), de cesser ses pratiques discriminatoires et de r\u00e9former le Programme des services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (le Programme des SEFPN) et le Protocole d'entente sur les programmes d'aide sociale pour les Indiens applicable en Ontario (l'Entente de 1965) de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu'ils tiennent compte des conclusions formul\u00e9es aux termes de la d\u00e9cision. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de cesser d'appliquer sa d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre des mesures pour appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens.\n[3] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la complexit\u00e9 et les effets d'une grande port\u00e9e de ces ordonnances, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de fournir davantage de pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre en \u0153uvre ces ordonnances de mani\u00e8re pratique, significative et efficace, \u00e0 court et \u00e0 long terme. Il a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 davantage de pr\u00e9cisions concernant les demandes d'indemnisation des plaignants en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur ces questions encore en litige une fois que les parties auront fourni davantage de pr\u00e9cisions.\n[4] Le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 les parties qu'il traiterait des questions encore en litige concernant les mesures de redressement en trois \u00e9tapes. Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal traitera des demandes de r\u00e9formes imm\u00e9diates au Programme des SEFPN, \u00e0 l'Entente de 1965 et au principe de Jordan. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur ce sujet.\n[5] En guise de deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, il sera statu\u00e9 sur d'autres r\u00e9formes \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long termes au Programme des SEFPN et \u00e0 l'Entente de 1965 ainsi que sur d'autres demandes en mati\u00e8re de formation et de contr\u00f4le permanent. Enfin, les parties traiteront des demandes d'indemnisation en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3).\nII. Progr\u00e8s \u00e0 ce jour\n[6] AANC accepte la d\u00e9cision, et il n'a pas demand\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des conclusions ou des ordonnances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales formul\u00e9es aux termes de la d\u00e9cision. AANC est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avec les organismes responsables des services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, les prestataires de services de premi\u00e8re ligne, les organismes, les instances dirigeantes et les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations ainsi que les provinces et territoires \u00e0 des mesures conduisant \u00e0 des r\u00e9formes des programmes et des changements importants pour les enfants et les familles. AANC a aussi pris des engagements expr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qui suit :\nUne r\u00e9forme compl\u00e8te du programme de protection de l'enfance.\nUne r\u00e9vision de l'Entente de 1965.\nNe pas r\u00e9duire ni restreindre le financement du Programme des SEFPN.\nR\u00e9tablir imm\u00e9diatement le Comit\u00e9 consultatif national.\nEt il appuie la nouvelle it\u00e9ration de l'\u00c9tude canadienne sur les incidences.\n[7] Les observations d'AANC indiquaient \u00e9galement que les mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates donnant suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision comprendraient une augmentation du financement du Programme des SEFPN. Le budget f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de 2016 a allou\u00e9 634,8 millions de dollars sur cinq ans au Programme des SEFPN. Selon l'AANC, 71,1 millions de dollars seront fournis en 2016-2017 pour ce qui suit :\n54,2 millions de dollars pour :\no des ajustements imm\u00e9diats apport\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention au moyen d'investissements additionnels pour mettre \u00e0 jour les accords de financement existants;\no des augmentations des montants des achats de services par enfant (y compris pour les services de pr\u00e9vention);\no un financement des services des admissions et des enqu\u00eates;\no des rajustements \u00e0 la hausse pour les organismes qui ont plus de 6 % des enfants \u00e0 leur charge; et\no des investissements pour fournir un soutien f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aux fins de l'expansion des syst\u00e8mes provinciaux de gestion des cas dans les r\u00e9serves.\n16,2 millions de dollars pour financer les activit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9vention en Ontario, en Colombie-Britannique, au Nouveau-Brunswick, \u00e0 Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et au Yukon \u00e0 des niveaux uniformes \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale dans tous les ressorts.\n700 000 dollars pour accro\u00eetre les ressources dont dispose AANC afin de recruter des prestataires de services, les mobiliser et leur allouer efficacement du financement.\n[8] En plus du financement annonc\u00e9 dans le budget de 2016, AANC s'engage \u00e9galement \u00e0 fournir du financement additionnel pour :\nmaintenir le financement pour composer avec les pressions budg\u00e9taires cr\u00e9\u00e9es par suite des modifications l\u00e9gislatives provinciales des exigences relatives \u00e0 la prestation des services, lorsque de telles modifications sont apport\u00e9es; et\nsoutenir un processus de mobilisation \u00e0 mesure que la situation \u00e9voluera, de concert avec le Comit\u00e9 consultatif national et les tables r\u00e9gionales, pour travailler aux r\u00e9formes \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme.\n[9] Le Tribunal prend acte des engagements pris par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, et il trouve encourageants les efforts que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour mettre en \u0153uvre les ordonnances du Tribunal.\nIII. Ordonnance mise \u00e0 jour\n[10] Il vaut la peine de r\u00e9it\u00e9rer certains des principes de redressement du Tribunal afin de favoriser une compr\u00e9hension commune des objectifs et des pouvoirs du Tribunal au moment de concevoir un redressement en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision.\n[11] Les lois sur les droits de la personne expriment des valeurs fondamentales et poursuivent des objectifs communs. En fait, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 la nature quasi-constitutionnelle de la LCDP \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions (voir par exemple Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 RCS 84 aux p. 89-90 [Robichaud]; Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30 au par. 81; et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 au par. 62 [Mowat]). Compte tenu de cette caract\u00e9ristique particuli\u00e8re, la LCDP doit s'interpr\u00e9ter d'une mani\u00e8re large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, de telle sorte que les droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s soient pleinement reconnus et qu'il y soit donn\u00e9 pleinement effet (voir Mowat, aux par. 33 et 62).\n[12] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, lorsque le Tribunal con\u00e7oit un redressement \u00e0 la suite de l'\u00e9tablissement du bien-fond\u00e9 d'une plainte, les pouvoirs que l'article 53 de la LCDP conf\u00e8re au Tribunal doivent s'interpr\u00e9ter d'une mani\u00e8re qui assure au mieux la r\u00e9alisation des objets de la Loi. Aux termes de l'article 2, la LCDP a pour objet de donner effet au principe selon lequel :\nle droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, [\u00e0 l'abri de pratiques discriminatoires] [...]\n[13] Le Tribunal doit tenir compte de cet objet pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant lorsqu'il \u00e9labore une ordonnance en vertu de l'article 53 de la LCDP. En accord avec cet objet, le but du prononc\u00e9 d'une ordonnance en vertu de l'article 53 n'est pas de punir la personne qui se livre ou s'est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire, mais d'\u00e9liminer et de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination (voir Robichaud au par. 13; et CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, [1987] 1 RCS 1114 \u00e0 la p. 1134 [Action Travail des Femmes]).\n[14] Suivant une d\u00e9marche fond\u00e9e sur des principes et motiv\u00e9e, en tenant compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'esp\u00e8ce et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, le Tribunal doit veiller \u00e0 ce que ses ordonnances de redressement parviennent \u00e0 promouvoir efficacement les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la LCDP et \u00e0 compenser utilement toute perte subie par la victime de discrimination (voir Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4 au par. 50; Doucet-Boudreau c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (ministre de l'\u00c9ducation), 2003 CSC 62 aux par. 25 et 55; et Action Travail des Femmes \u00e0 la p. 1134).\n[15] Cela dit, \u00e9laborer des redressements efficaces et utiles pour r\u00e9soudre un diff\u00e9rend complexe, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, est une t\u00e2che d\u00e9licate. En effet, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada l'a affirm\u00e9 dans Grover c. Conseil national de recherches du Canada (1994), 24 CHRR D\/390 (C.F.) au par. 40 [Grover], [TRADUCTION] \u00ab une telle t\u00e2che demande de l'innovation et de la souplesse de la part du Tribunal dans l'\u00e9laboration de mesures de redressement efficaces, et la Loi est structur\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 favoriser cette souplesse \u00bb.\n[16] Mis \u00e0 part les ordonnances d'indemnisation, cette souplesse dans l'\u00e9laboration de mesures de redressement efficaces trouve sa source principalement dans les alin\u00e9as 52(2)a) et b) de la LCDP. Ces dispositions conf\u00e8rent au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner des mesures pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables [voir l'al. 53(2)a)] et d'ordonner que soient accord\u00e9s \u00e0 la victime d'un acte discriminatoire les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte discriminatoire l'a priv\u00e9e [voir l'al. 53(2)b)].\n[17] L'application de ces vastes pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration peut primer le droit d'une organisation de g\u00e9rer sa propre entreprise et, en particulier en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b), peut conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la victime d'un acte discriminatoire le droit de demander une r\u00e9paration en nature (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113 aux par. 165 et 167, infirm\u00e9 pour d'autres motifs par Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2014 CAF 110; et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. MacAlpine (1989), 12 CHRR D\/253 (CAF) au par. 6). Toujours dans le souci de veiller \u00e0 ce que les ordonnances de redressement parviennent \u00e0 promouvoir efficacement les droits qu'elles prot\u00e8gent, l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9laborer des redressements visant \u00e0 \u00e9duquer les gens au sujet des droits consacr\u00e9s dans la LCDP (voir Schuyler c. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2006 TCDP 34 aux par. 166-170; et Robichaud c. Brennan (1989), 11 CHRR D\/194 (TCDP) aux par. 15 et 21).\n[18] Pour ce qui concerne pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour lutter contre le probl\u00e8me de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique (voir Action Travail des Femmes \u00e0 la p. 1138 renvoyant \u00e0 l'al. 41(2)a) de la LCDP, L.C. 1976-77, c. 33 [maintenant l'al. 53(2)a)]). Pour combattre la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, \u00ab il est essentiel de cr\u00e9er un climat dans lequel tant les pratiques que les attitudes n\u00e9gatives peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es et d\u00e9courag\u00e9es \u00bb (Action Travail des Femmes \u00e0 la p. 1139). C'est-\u00e0-dire que, pour que le Tribunal mette fin aux actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et les pr\u00e9vienne, il doit tenir compte de toute situation historique de discrimination afin d'\u00e9laborer des strat\u00e9gies judicieuses pour l'avenir (voir Action Travail des Femmes \u00e0 la p. 1141).\n[19] C'est en gardant \u00e0 l'esprit ces principes en mati\u00e8re de redressement que le Tribunal s'att\u00e8le \u00e0 la t\u00e2che qui consiste \u00e0 continuer d'\u00e9laborer une ordonnance efficace et significative pour rem\u00e9dier aux actes discriminatoires identifi\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision.\nA. Le Programme des SEFPN\n[20] Les principales conclusions du Tribunal concernant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9former et de repenser le Programme des SEFPN \u00e0 court et \u00e0 long terme ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es aux paragraphes 384 \u00e0 389 (voir aussi le par. 458) de la d\u00e9cision, et elles comprennent notamment les conclusions suivantes (non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original) :\n[384] Dans le cadre du programme des SEFPN, la Directive 20\u20111 pr\u00e9sente plusieurs lacunes et elle incite \u00e0 retirer les enfants de leur milieu familial et de leur collectivit\u00e9. La Directive 20\u20111 formule des hypoth\u00e8ses reposant sur des seuils de population et sur le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge pour financer les budgets d\u2019exploitation des organismes de SEFPN. Ces hypoth\u00e8ses ne tiennent pas compte de la v\u00e9ritable situation qui existe en mati\u00e8re de protection des enfants dans bon nombre des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves. Les budgets d\u2019exploitation sont fixes, tandis que les budgets d\u2019entretien pour la prise en charge des enfants sont remboursables au prix co\u00fbtant. Si un organisme de SEFPN ne dispose pas des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour offrir des services \u00e0 m\u00eame son budget d\u2019exploitation, la seule solution qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 lui dans bien des cas consiste \u00e0 ordonner la prise en charge de l\u2019enfant pour pouvoir lui fournir les services n\u00e9cessaires. Dans le cas des organismes petits et \u00e9loign\u00e9s, les seuils de population de la Directive 20\u20111 ont pour effet de r\u00e9duire de fa\u00e7on sensible les budgets d\u2019exploitation, en plus de nuire \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir des programmes efficaces et de r\u00e9pondre aux situations d\u2019urgence et, pour certaines d\u2019entre elles, de les obliger \u00e0 fermer leurs portes.\n[385] La Directive 20\u20111 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9ritablement mise \u00e0 jour depuis le milieu des ann\u00e9es 90, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 le sous-financement des organismes de SEFPN et une situation d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. De plus, la Directive 20\u20111 n\u2019est pas conforme aux lois et aux normes provinciales qui pr\u00e9conisent la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices pour les enfants et les familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, bon nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont priv\u00e9s d\u2019une chance \u00e9quitable de demeurer unis ou d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9unis en temps opportun. En 2008, au moment de la plainte, la vaste majorit\u00e9 des organismes de SEFPN du Canada \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111. \u00c0 la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019audience en 2014, la Directive 20\u20111 s\u2019appliquait encore \u00e0 trois provinces ainsi qu\u2019au Yukon.\n[386] AADNC a transpos\u00e9 certaines des m\u00eames lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111 dans l\u2019AAAP, notamment celles concernant les enfants pris en charge et les niveaux de population ainsi que celles concernant les volets fixes de financement pour les activit\u00e9s et la pr\u00e9vention. Malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait conscient de ces lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111 \u00e0 la suite de nombreux rapports, AADNC n\u2019a pas suivi des recommandations formul\u00e9es dans les rapports en question et a perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 la principale lacune du programme des SEFPN, en l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019incitation \u00e0 prendre les enfants en charge et \u00e0 les retirer de leur milieu familial.\n[387] De plus, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Directive 20\u20111, l\u2019AAAP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiquement mise \u00e0 jour pour tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9volution des lois et des normes des provinces concern\u00e9es. Une fois l\u2019AAAP mise en \u0153uvre, aucun rajustement n\u2019est apport\u00e9 au financement pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation ou du co\u00fbt de la vie ou des changements apport\u00e9s aux normes de service ainsi que de l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts avec le temps ou pour s\u2019assurer que les sommes consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention correspondent davantage \u00e0 toute la gamme des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts hors r\u00e9serve. En revanche, lorsqu\u2019AADNC finance directement les provinces, les augmentations attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019inflation ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres co\u00fbts g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sont remboursables, assurant ainsi une ad\u00e9quation plus \u00e9troite avec les normes de service de la province ou du territoire concern\u00e9.\n[388] Pour ce qui est de la question de s\u2019assurer que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts dans les r\u00e9serves sont raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux qui sont offerts hors r\u00e9serve, le programme des SEFPN pr\u00e9sente une lacune flagrante. Bien que les organismes de SEFPN soient tenus de se conformer aux lois et aux normes provinciales et territoriales, les autorisations de financement du programme des SEFPN ne sont pas accord\u00e9es en fonction des lois et des normes de services des provinces et des territoires. Elles sont plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9es sur des niveaux et des formules de financement qui ne sont pas conformes aux lois et aux normes applicables. Elles ne tiennent par ailleurs pas compte des besoins r\u00e9els des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations en mati\u00e8re de services, qui sont souvent plus lourds que ceux des personnes vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves. De plus, la fa\u00e7on dont les formules de financement et les autorisations des programmes fonctionnent emp\u00eache une comparaison efficace avec les syst\u00e8mes provinciaux. Il arrive souvent que les provinces et les territoires n\u2019utilisent pas de formule de financement et la fa\u00e7on dont les provinces et les territoires g\u00e8rent les variables relatives aux co\u00fbts est souvent tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente d\u2019une province et d\u2019un territoire \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Au lieu de modifier son syst\u00e8me pour l\u2019adapter de fa\u00e7on efficace aux syst\u00e8mes des provinces et des territoires pour assurer une comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable, AADNC a conserv\u00e9 ses formules de financement et y a incorpor\u00e9 quelques variables qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir des provinces et des territoires, notamment les salaires.\n[389] Compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas adapt\u00e9e pour tenir compte des lois et des normes provinciales et territoriales, la structure de financement actuelle du programme des SEFPN cr\u00e9e souvent des probl\u00e8mes de financement pour des postes comme les salaires et les avantages sociaux, la formation, les rajustements pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie, les frais juridiques, les primes d\u2019assurances, les frais de d\u00e9placement, les primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, les bureaux multiples, les grandes infrastructures, les programmes et les services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, les repr\u00e9sentants des bandes et les mesures les moins perturbatrices. Il est difficile, voire impossible, pour bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN de se conformer aux lois et aux normes provinciales et territoriales en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille s\u2019ils ne disposent pas d\u2019un financement suffisant pour ces postes ou, dans le cas de nombreux petits organismes \u00e9loign\u00e9s, de m\u00eame pouvoir fournir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De fait, les formules de financement des SEFPN ne procurent pas suffisamment de fonds \u00e0 bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de leur client\u00e8le. La m\u00e9thodologie de financement d\u2019AADNC contr\u00f4le sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles et d\u2019assurer qu\u2019on leur offre des services raisonnablement comparables tant dans les r\u00e9serves qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celles\u2011ci. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de nombreux rapports et \u00e9valuations sur le programme des SEFPN d\u00e9non\u00e7ant le fait que la norme de la \u00ab comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable \u00bb d\u2019AADNC n\u2019est pas suffisamment d\u00e9finie et mesur\u00e9e, ce probl\u00e8me n\u2019a toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\n[21] Les plaignants et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de supprimer imm\u00e9diatement les aspects les plus discriminatoires des r\u00e9gimes de financement qu'il utilise pour financer les organismes prestataires de SEFPN dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN; et, en r\u00e9ponse, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de mettre fin \u00e0 ses pratiques discriminatoires et de r\u00e9former le Programme des SEFPN de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tenir compte des conclusions formul\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision. Il est vrai que le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions relativement \u00e0 certaines questions touchant les redressements, et le Tribunal a compris que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aurait peut-\u00eatre besoin d'un certain temps pour examiner la d\u00e9cision et mettre au point une strat\u00e9gie pour y donner suite, mais c'\u00e9tait il y a trois mois, et il y a encore de l'incertitude dans l'esprit des parties et dans celui du Tribunal quant \u00e0 savoir comment la r\u00e9ponse du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision fait \u00e9cho aux conclusions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es. Le Tribunal comprend bien que certaines r\u00e9formes du Programme des SEFPN requerront une strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 plus long terme; toutefois, la question n'est toujours pas claire de savoir pourquoi ou en quoi il n'a toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 certaines des conclusions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es trois mois apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision. Au lieu de constituer des mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates, certaines de ces mesures pourraient maintenant devenir des mesures de redressement \u00e0 moyen terme.\n[22] Encore une fois, bien que le Tribunal appr\u00e9cie les engagements et les efforts du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e0 ce jour, le Tribunal aura besoin de plus de clart\u00e9 de la part d'AANC \u00e0 l'avenir pour s'assurer que ses ordonnances sont mises en \u0153uvre efficacement et significativement. Comme l'Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations l'a affirm\u00e9 dans ses observations : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [u]ne ordonnance prescrivant une mesure de redressement imm\u00e9diate touchant le Programme des SEFPN devrait \u00eatre significative, mais temporaire jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le Programme des SEFPN puisse \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9 de fond en comble \u00bb. Le Tribunal est d'accord avec cette affirmation. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal croit que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der consiste \u00e0 ce qu'AANC fasse r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement rapport au Tribunal. C'est-\u00e0-dire que le Tribunal contr\u00f4lera la mise en \u0153uvre de ses ordonnances au moyen de rapports d\u00e9taill\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers fournis par AANC, au sujet desquels les parties auront la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations.\n[23] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 AANC de prendre imm\u00e9diatement des mesures pour corriger les \u00e9l\u00e9ments soulign\u00e9s plus haut dans les conclusions formul\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision. AANC communiquera ensuite un rapport exhaustif, qui comportera des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur chaque conclusion soulign\u00e9e plus haut et expliquera comment il y est donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 court terme pour procurer un redressement imm\u00e9diat aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves. Le rapport devra \u00e9galement comporter des renseignements sur les budgets allou\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque organisme de SEFPN et des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers relatifs \u00e0 ces allocations, notamment des calculs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des montants que chaque organisme a re\u00e7us en 2015-2016, les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es pour faire ces calculs et les montants que chaque organisme a re\u00e7us ou recevra en 2016-2017, de m\u00eame qu'un calcul d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de tout rajustement effectu\u00e9 par suite de mesures imm\u00e9diates prises pour donner suite aux conclusions formul\u00e9es aux termes de la d\u00e9cision.\n[24] AANC devra fournir ce rapport dans les quatre semaines suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. \u00c0 la suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du rapport, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis la d\u00e9cision, une r\u00e9union de gestion de l'instance en personne aura alors lieu pour donner aux parties et au Tribunal l'occasion de discuter du rapport, de poser des questions et de formuler des observations, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Ensuite, le Tribunal prononcera une autre d\u00e9cision si n\u00e9cessaire. Le Tribunal consultera les parties pour obtenir leurs disponibilit\u00e9s afin de fixer des dates pour cette r\u00e9union de gestion de l'instance dans les jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[25] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet qu'AANC a fourni des renseignements additionnels concernant son allocation budg\u00e9taire de 2016 pour le Programme des SEFPN apr\u00e8s la fin de la pr\u00e9sentation d'observations aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et a invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 le rencontrer pour discuter de la question. Les plaignants ont soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations quant au moment o\u00f9 ces renseignements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au Tribunal et quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Ni l'un ni l'autre n'est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'il y ait une autre ronde d'observations sur la question \u00e0 ce stade. Le Tribunal n'a pas tenu compte des renseignements additionnels d'AANC concernant le budget de 2016 dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Toutefois, d'une mani\u00e8re beaucoup plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, ces renseignements feront probablement partie des renseignements \u00e0 inclure dans le rapport \u00e0 venir, et les autres parties auront la possibilit\u00e9 de formuler des observations \u00e0 leur sujet.\nB. L'Entente de 1965\n[26] La principale conclusion du Tribunal concernant l'Entente de 1965 \u00e9tait que celle-ci n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour pour s'assurer que les collectivit\u00e9s vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en Ontario pourraient se conformer \u00e0 la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, notamment quant \u00e0 la nomination de repr\u00e9sentants des bandes et \u00e0 la prestation de services de sant\u00e9 mentale (voir la d\u00e9cision aux par. 217-246 et 458).\n[27] Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a fait savoir qu'il avait rencontr\u00e9 le gouvernement de l'Ontario et avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de revoir l'Entente de 1965. Il soutient que ces rencontres pr\u00e9liminaires ont pav\u00e9 la voie \u00e0 des discussions plus \u00e9labor\u00e9es qui seront tenues avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[28] En outre, \u00e0 la suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision, et pendant que des observations \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour permission d'intervenir en qualit\u00e9 de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. NAN souhaite traiter de l'\u00e9laboration et de la mise en \u0153uvre des ordonnances du Tribunal dans le contexte particulier des collectivit\u00e9s recul\u00e9es et nordiques en Ontario.\n[29] Malgr\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de NAN, le Tribunal s'est engag\u00e9 envers les parties \u00e0 statuer rapidement sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui appellent des mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates, et il voulait statuer sur le plus grand nombre possible de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Toutefois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal statuera sur la requ\u00eate de NAN peu apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et qu'il se peut qu'il y ait d'autres observations \u00e0 prendre en compte au sujet de l'Entente de 1965, le Tribunal estime qu'il serait mieux indiqu\u00e9 de statuer sur tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment appelant des mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'Entente de 1965 apr\u00e8s qu'il aura re\u00e7u ces observations additionnelles des parties.\nC. Le principe de Jordan\n[30] Dans la d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u00e9finissait et mettait en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9troite et inad\u00e9quate, ce qui entra\u00eenait des lacunes dans les services et des retards dans la prestation de services et des refus de services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, des d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient inh\u00e9rents au processus de traitement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des cas potentiellement vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan, et l'on ne sait toujours pas avec certitude la raison pour laquelle la position du gouvernement est ax\u00e9e principalement sur les conflits intergouvernementaux dans les situations dans lesquelles un enfant a plusieurs handicaps, par opposition \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris entre minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux) mettant en cause des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et non uniquement ceux qui ont plusieurs handicaps (voir la d\u00e9cision aux par. 379-382 et 458).\n[31] Selon le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, AANC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont entam\u00e9 des discussions au sujet du processus visant \u00e0 \u00e9tendre la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan, \u00e0 en am\u00e9liorer la mise en \u0153uvre et \u00e0 recenser d'autres partenaires qui devraient prendre part \u00e0 ce processus. Aux cours des deux ou trois prochains mois, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral entamera ces discussions avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les provinces et territoires. Il pr\u00e9voit que des options de modifications au principe de Jordan pourraient \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9es dans les douze mois.\n[32] Toutefois, l'ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e9non\u00e7ait express\u00e9ment qu'AANC devait \u00ab appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens \u00bb (la d\u00e9cision au par. 481). Le Tribunal comprend qu'il a pu falloir un certain temps pour rencontrer des partenaires et des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et mettre un cadre en place, mais le Tribunal ne pr\u00e9voyait pas que cette ordonnance prendrait plus de trois mois \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre. Il est ordonn\u00e9 d'[TRADUCTION] \u00ab appliquer imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb, et non d'entamer imm\u00e9diatement des discussions en vue de revoir la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 long terme. Il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 une d\u00e9finition fonctionnelle du principe de Jordan qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la Chambre des communes. Bien que la r\u00e9vision de cette d\u00e9finition et le cadre du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour mener cette r\u00e9vision \u00e0 bien puissent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'un examen \u00e0 long terme, le Tribunal ne voit aucune raison pour laquelle la d\u00e9finition actuelle ne peut pas \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre maintenant.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne qu'AANC consid\u00e8re imm\u00e9diatement que le principe de Jordan inclut englobe tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (cela comprend les diff\u00e9rends entre minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et concerne tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (non uniquement ceux qui ont plusieurs handicaps). Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'esprit et \u00e0 l'objet du principe de Jordan, l'organisme gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier devrait payer le service sans devoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques ni tenir des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas avant qu'un financement soit fourni.\n[34] AANC fera rapport au Tribunal dans les deux semaines de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pour confirmer que cette ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u0153uvre.\nD. Autres questions en litige\n[35] Les plaignants ont formul\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes autres observations concernant la mise en \u0153uvre des ordonnances du Tribunal \u00e0 court terme. AANC a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 certaines de ces observations, mais \u00e0 d'autres non (voir par exemple le par. 16 des observations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations dat\u00e9es du 31 mars 2016 et les par. 12 \u00e0 15 des observations de l'Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations dat\u00e9es du 3 mars 2016). Il serait utile pour le Tribunal et les parties si AANC pouvait traiter de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments additionnels appelant des mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates dans le cadre de son rapport sur le Programme des SEFPN ordonn\u00e9 plus haut. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans son rapport sur le Programme des SEFPN, le Tribunal donne instruction \u00e0 AANC de traiter de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments appelant des mesures de redressement imm\u00e9diates selon les plaignants dont AANC n'a pas trait\u00e9 dans ses observations \u00e0 ce jour.\nE. R\u00e9serve de comp\u00e9tence\n[36] Les ordonnances de redressement visant \u00e0 s'attaquer \u00e0 des cas de discrimination syst\u00e9mique peuvent \u00eatre difficiles \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre, et, par cons\u00e9quent, il se peut qu'elles requi\u00e8rent un contr\u00f4le continu. En r\u00e9servant sa comp\u00e9tence dans ces circonstances, le Tribunal se donne les moyens de s'assurer que ses ordonnances de redressement sont mises en \u0153uvre efficacement (voir Grover aux par. 32-33).\n[37] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la nature continue des ordonnances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es plus haut, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal doit encore statuer sur d'autres demandes de redressement en suspens, le Tribunal continuera \u00e0 demeurer saisi de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Apr\u00e8s cela, tout maintien de comp\u00e9tence ult\u00e9rieur sera r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu'AANC aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autres rapports et que le Tribunal aura statu\u00e9 sur les autres demandes de redressement en suspens.\nIV. Observations finales de la pr\u00e9sidente de la formation\n[38] J'aimerais faire quelques observations finales aux parties. Le membre Lustig a lu ces observations et les appuie.\n[39] Les audiences dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues dans un esprit de r\u00e9conciliation, dans le but fondamental de maintenir une ambiance de paix et de respect. Le respect de toutes les parties en cause \u00e9tait primordial et, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la nature de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le respect des Autochtones, non seulement ceux qui prenaient part \u00e0 l'instance, mais aussi ceux qui suivaient l'instance en personne et sur le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones. Favoriser cette ambiance de paix et de respect est d'une importance primordiale consid\u00e9rant le r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9termination de droits fondamentaux de la personne et dans la sauvegarde de la confiance du public dans l'administration de la justice, surtout pour les Autochtones.\n[40] Lorsque nous traiterons des questions qui restent en litige concernant des redressements dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, nous devrions continuer \u00e0 viser la paix et le respect. Surtout, j'exhorte toutes les personnes en cause \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 ce que signifie v\u00e9ritablement la r\u00e9conciliation et \u00e0 comment nous pouvons la r\u00e9aliser. Je crois fermement que nous avons une occasion, nous tous ensemble, de donner un exemple positif aux enfants partout au Canada, et m\u00eame partout dans le monde, en d\u00e9montrant que nous sommes capables de faire notre part pour r\u00e9aliser la r\u00e9conciliation au Canada. Mon espoir et mon but sont que, pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00e0 venir, les gens consid\u00e9reront ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire comme un point tournant qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 des changements significatifs pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations partout dans ce pays. Nous, le Tribunal et les parties, sommes dans une position privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e pour continuer \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 ce changement d'une mani\u00e8re substantielle.\n[41] Au cours de ce p\u00e9riple vers le changement, j'esp\u00e8re que la confiance pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie entre les parties. Des communications efficaces et transparentes seront de la plus haute importance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les mots doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9s par des actes, et les actes ne seront pas compris s'ils ne sont pas communiqu\u00e9s. La r\u00e9conciliation n'est pas possible sans communication ou sans collaboration entre les parties. Bien que les circonstances qui ont men\u00e9 aux conclusions formul\u00e9es aux termes de la d\u00e9cision soient tr\u00e8s d\u00e9concertantes, l'occasion de donner suite \u00e0 ces conclusions en apportant des changements positifs se pr\u00e9sente maintenant. C'est la saison du changement. C'est maintenant le moment.\n[42] Enfin, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'esprit de r\u00e9conciliation et de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Tribunal avait esp\u00e9r\u00e9 que les parties se seraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9es quelques fois et auraient discut\u00e9 de redressements. Chaque partie poss\u00e8de des renseignements et une expertise qui faciliteraient ces discussions et seraient utiles pour r\u00e9gler la pr\u00e9sente affaire plus rapidement. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait tenu de rendre la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, mais il continue \u00e0 encourager les parties \u00e0 se rencontrer et \u00e0 discuter de la r\u00e9solution de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Comme toujours, le Tribunal est disponible pour pr\u00eater assistance, et il demeure d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 superviser la mise en \u0153uvre de ses ordonnances \u00e0 court et \u00e0 moyen terme.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nEdward P.

Requ\u00eate visant l\u2019obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\n[1] La Nishnawbe Aski Nation (la NAN), plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le comit\u00e9 des chefs de la NAN, sollicite l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019instance portant sur la r\u00e9paration, en tant que partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. La NAN est une organisation politique territoriale qui d\u00e9fend les int\u00e9r\u00eats socio\u00e9conomiques et politiques de 49 collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Nord de l\u2019Ontario.\n[2] En vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) et de l\u2019article 3 et du paragraphe 8(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104), l\u2019octroi du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal. Cela \u00e9tant, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle (voir Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1989] 1 RCS 560, p. 568-569; et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2013 TCDP 16, par. 50).\n[3] Les demandes visant l\u2019obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e sont tranch\u00e9es au cas par cas, en tenant compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019instance et des questions qui sont en train d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9es. Une personne ou une organisation peut se voir accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e si l\u2019instance a des incidences sur elle et si elle peut aider le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher les questions dont il est saisi. Cette aide doit apporter un \u00e9clairage diff\u00e9rent aux th\u00e8ses d\u00e9fendues par les autres parties et contribuer \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cision par le Tribunal. Par ailleurs, en vertu du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP, l\u2019un des principes qui doit sous-tendre la d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la participation d\u2019une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e est que le Tribunal doit instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (voir Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2000 CanLII 28883 (TCDP), par. 22-23; Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2001 CanLII 25862 (TCDP), par. 6; Warman c.

Toutefois, en tant que ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et vu les exigences de la LCDP, la formation doit \u00eatre convaincue que la NAN peut apporter une contribution utile \u00e0 l\u2019instance et aider le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher les questions dont il est saisi; si ces conditions sont r\u00e9unies, elle doit d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue que peut prendre la participation de la NAN.\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, la requ\u00eate de la NAN visant l\u2019obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e est accueillie. La participation de la NAN se limitera \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites concernant des consid\u00e9rations particuli\u00e8res touchant la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord de l\u2019Ontario et les mesures n\u00e9cessaires qui permettraient de fournir des services appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ces collectivit\u00e9s.\nII. Int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019instance et aide devant \u00eatre fournie\n[6] La NAN cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des documents \u00e9crits par suite de l\u2019ordonnance d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 CHRT 2 (la d\u00e9cision) rendue par la pr\u00e9sente formation. Dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a conclu, sur le fondement de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon sont priv\u00e9s de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux que re\u00e7oivent les autres membres de la population canadienne ou sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s dans la prestation de tels services. La formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AANDC), maintenant Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada (AANC), de cesser ses pratiques discriminatoires et de r\u00e9former le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (SEFPN) et le Protocole d\u2019entente sur les programmes d\u2019aide sociale pour les Indiens (l\u2019Entente de 1965) applicable en Ontario de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tenir compte des conclusions de la d\u00e9cision. Elle a aussi ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de cesser d\u2019appliquer une d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre imm\u00e9diatement des mesures pour pleinement mettre en \u0153uvre le sens et la port\u00e9e de ce principe.\n[7] Vu la complexit\u00e9 et les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une port\u00e9e consid\u00e9rable de ces ordonnances, la formation a demand\u00e9 des clarifications additionnelles aux parties sur la fa\u00e7on dont ces ordonnances pourraient \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre de fa\u00e7on pratique, valable et efficace, tant \u00e0 court qu\u2019\u00e0 long terme. Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 des clarifications suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet des demandes d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 des plaignants fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. La formation a conserv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence pour traiter de ces questions en suspens apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception des clarifications des parties.\n[8] La NAN veut apporter son aide pour clarifier ces questions relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration. Elle fait valoir que les mesures de r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9es par le Tribunal auront un impact direct sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans son territoire. Les collectivit\u00e9s de la NAN se trouvent typiquement dans des r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es, sans acc\u00e8s routier \u00e0 longueur d\u2019ann\u00e9e, et sont dispers\u00e9es sur un territoire qui couvre les deux tiers de l\u2019Ontario. Elle soutient avoir une expertise unique en ce qui concerne les consid\u00e9rations particuli\u00e8res propres \u00e0 la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et nordiques et les mesures n\u00e9cessaires qui doivent \u00eatre prises pour pouvoir fournir des services appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ces collectivit\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce chapitre, elle collabore aussi avec le gouvernement de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie sur les enfants et les jeunes Autochtones. Dans le cadre des discussions men\u00e9es \u00e0 cette fin, elle traite des m\u00eames sujets que ceux dont il est question dans la d\u00e9cision, notamment du principe de Jordan, de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario et du financement des programmes de pr\u00e9vention. La NAN veut partager son exp\u00e9rience et ses connaissances avec le Tribunal pour faire en sorte que toutes les mesures de r\u00e9paration ordonn\u00e9es soient con\u00e7ues et mises en \u0153uvre en tenant compte du contexte particulier des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et nordiques.\n[9] En fait, beaucoup des conclusions de la formation concernant l\u2019Entente de 1965 ont trait \u00e0 la situation des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es de l\u2019Ontario et aux d\u00e9fis auxquels elles sont confront\u00e9es. La formation a identifi\u00e9 divers facteurs qui ont une incidence sur la qualit\u00e9 des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts \u00e0 ces collectivit\u00e9s et qui peuvent avoir comme cons\u00e9quence que plus d\u2019enfants sont sortis de la collectivit\u00e9 pour recevoir ces services. Parmi ces facteurs, notons les co\u00fbts accrus, en temps et en argent, pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance qui doivent se rendre dans des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es; les d\u00e9fis auxquels sont confront\u00e9es les collectivit\u00e9s pour le recrutement et la r\u00e9tention de personnel dans un contexte o\u00f9 les besoins augmentent; la p\u00e9nurie de logements appropri\u00e9s, ce qui rend difficile de trouver des familles d\u2019accueil dans des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es; le manque de programmes de services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 disponibles pr\u00e8s des collectivit\u00e9s et l\u2019acc\u00e8s limit\u00e9 \u00e0 des services judiciaires pour ces collectivit\u00e9s; et les infrastructures d\u00e9ficientes et des lacunes sur le plan du renforcement des capacit\u00e9s limitent les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ainsi que la possibilit\u00e9 de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces difficult\u00e9s (voir la d\u00e9cision aux par. 231-235, 245 et 392).\n[10] En raison de son lien direct avec les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es qui sont expos\u00e9es \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes, la NAN pourra aider la formation \u00e0 comprendre les int\u00e9r\u00eats de ces collectivit\u00e9s et \u00e0 en tenir compte pour \u00e9laborer une r\u00e9ponse efficace et valable. Dans le m\u00eame esprit, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa collaboration avec le gouvernement de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie sur les enfants et les jeunes Autochtones, la NAN peut aider la formation \u00e0 concevoir des ordonnances valables pour faire suite aux conclusions que la formation a tir\u00e9es au sujet de l\u2019Entente de 1965; plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la formation a conclu que cette entente n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 revue depuis longtemps et ne tient pas compte des changements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s au fil des ans \u00e0 la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille concernant par exemple les repr\u00e9sentants des bandes et les services de sant\u00e9 mentale et de pr\u00e9vention. La formation a jug\u00e9 que les probl\u00e8mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question \u00e9taient aggrav\u00e9s par le manque de coordination entre les diff\u00e9rents programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux portant sur les services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 touchant les enfants et les familles dans le besoin, m\u00eame si ces programmes devraient \u00eatre mis en \u0153uvre de mani\u00e8re simultan\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario (voir la d\u00e9cision aux par. 228\u2011230, 235, 392 et 458).\n[11] Vu ces conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision et la r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Entente de 1965 ordonn\u00e9e par la formation pour faire en sorte que ce document r\u00e9ponde aux pr\u00e9occupations qui ont men\u00e9es \u00e0 ces conclusions, il est manifeste que la NAN a un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la pr\u00e9sente instance et, plus important encore, qu\u2019elle pourrait probablement apporter une contribution et une aide valables \u00e0 la formation pour les derni\u00e8res questions qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce concernant les mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nIII. \u00c9tendue de la participation\n[12] Malgr\u00e9 sa conclusion concernant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la NAN et la contribution qu\u2019elle est susceptible d\u2019apporter, la formation doit s\u2019assurer que l\u2019intervention propos\u00e9e ne porte pas atteinte de fa\u00e7on indue \u00e0 l\u2019exigence selon laquelle l\u2019instruction se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et qu\u2019elle ne porte pas pr\u00e9judice aux parties ou au Tribunal. Ainsi, la NAN propose de d\u00e9poser des observations \u00e9crites au sujet des mesures de r\u00e9paration dans lesquelles elle apportera son \u00e9clairage unique en tant que d\u00e9fenseur des collectivit\u00e9s nordiques et \u00e9loign\u00e9es de l\u2019Ontario, mais ne reprendra pas les observations d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[13] Pour respecter les droits des parties dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, qui compte d\u00e9j\u00e0 quatre parties et deux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, mais aussi pour bien utiliser les ressources et le temps limit\u00e9s du Tribunal, il a fallu relever de nombreux d\u00e9fis lors de la gestion de l\u2019instance et de l\u2019audience. L\u2019ajout d\u2019une autre partie, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 ce stade tardif, non seulement est rare, mais aussi complexifie encore davantage la gestion de l\u2019instance. Cela dit, la formation conclut que les avantages que procurerait l\u2019intervention propos\u00e9e par la NAN l\u2019emportent sur les d\u00e9fis additionnels pos\u00e9s sur le plan de la gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[14] Toutefois, comme nous sommes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la r\u00e9paration, les observations \u00e9crites de la NAN ne devraient porter que sur des mesures de r\u00e9paration qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es, et non sur les questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es. L\u2019audience relative au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte est termin\u00e9e et la preuve sur ces questions, close. Le r\u00f4le de la formation \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l\u2019instance est de concevoir une ordonnance qui tienne compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire et des conclusions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision. Les clarifications des mesures de r\u00e9parations accord\u00e9es et le processus de mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision dont s\u2019occupe le Tribunal ne doivent pas \u00eatre confondus avec le r\u00f4le d\u2019une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate ou d\u2019une tribune visant la consultation de l\u2019une ou de l\u2019ensemble des parties. Dans le cas contraire, chaque collectivit\u00e9 ou organisme des Premi\u00e8res Nations pourrait demander d\u2019intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente instance pour partager ses propres connaissances et exp\u00e9riences ainsi que sa culture et son histoire. Le traitement de telles demandes, \u00e0 plus forte raison l\u2019admission de nouvelles parties dans les proc\u00e9dures en cours, entraverait de fa\u00e7on importante la capacit\u00e9 de la formation de finaliser son ordonnance.\n[15] Par ailleurs, pour ne pas reprendre les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les autres parties, la NAN devrait limiter ses observations \u00e9crites aux sujets pour lesquels elle dit pouvoir apporter un \u00e9clairage diff\u00e9rent des autres parties, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en ce qui a express\u00e9ment trait aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord de l\u2019Ontario et les mesures n\u00e9cessaires qui permettraient de fournir des services appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ces collectivit\u00e9s. Vu l\u2019\u00e9clairage unique de la NAN sur ces questions, la formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que ses observations portent principalement sur l\u2019application et la r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Entente de 1965. En fait, dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente sur cette question (2016 CHRT 10), la formation a ordonn\u00e9 des mesures de r\u00e9paration imm\u00e9diates, mais a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait plus appropri\u00e9 d\u2019attendre que la requ\u00eate de la NAN soit tranch\u00e9e avant de se prononcer sur les mesures de r\u00e9paration touchant l\u2019Entente de 1965 (voir par. 28-29).\n[16] En limitant de cette fa\u00e7on les observations de la NAN, la formation reconna\u00eet la contribution qu\u2019elle peut apporter dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, mais aussi celle des organisations qui d\u00e9fendent d\u00e9j\u00e0 les principaux int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations et Chiefs of Ontario repr\u00e9sentent diverses collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations partout au Canada et en Ontario. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats des enfants, des jeunes et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, et des organismes qui leur offrent des services, sont d\u00e9fendus par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada. Par ailleurs, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) d\u00e9fend l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public et a produit la majorit\u00e9 de la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris la preuve sur laquelle s\u2019est fond\u00e9e la formation pour parvenir aux conclusions susmentionn\u00e9es tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision concernant les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es de l\u2019Ontario.\n[17] Avec l\u2019aide de ces parties et des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, ainsi que de la NAN et d\u2019AANC, la formation estime qu\u2019elle disposera de suffisamment d\u2019observations pour concevoir une ordonnance valable et efficace en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[18] La NAN sera ajout\u00e9e comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance. Elle peut d\u00e9poser des observations \u00e9crites sur les mesures de r\u00e9paration conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres d\u00e9finis pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[19] La NAN dispose d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de dix jours ouvrables pour produire ses observations \u00e9crites sur les mesures de r\u00e9paration imm\u00e9diates. AANC, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, l\u2019APN, Chiefs of Ontario et la Commission auront ensuite dix jours ouvrables pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces observations. La NAN pourra ensuite r\u00e9pliquer, dans un d\u00e9lai de sept jours ouvrables, \u00e0 toute r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par AANC ou les autres parties, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nEdward P.

Ordonnance 16\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur deux plaintes r\u00e9unies, la premi\u00e8re dat\u00e9e du 28 juillet 2011, contre le particulier intim\u00e9, M. Gagan Gill, et la seconde, dat\u00e9e du 16 juin 2012, contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, Gillco Inc. Ces plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Shelby Anne Opheim (la \u00ab plaignante \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab CCDP \u00bb) (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9es collectivement la \u00ab plainte \u00bb). Selon la plainte, les deux intim\u00e9s, M. Gagan Gill et Gillco Inc. (collectivement, les \u00ab intim\u00e9s \u00bb) ont agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante pour des motifs fond\u00e9s sur le sexe et sur l\u2019\u00e2ge pendant que celle-ci \u00e9tait \u00e0 leur emploi. Elle dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019actes de harc\u00e8lement de la part de M. Gill du fait de son sexe et de son \u00e2ge, y compris ce qui suit : un comportement sexuel importun, une demande de travail sexualis\u00e9e et humiliante, ainsi que des remarques, des demandes et des attouchements \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel. Toutes les all\u00e9gations d\u00e9coulent de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi de la plaignante, soit entre les mois de mai et de juin 2011.\n[2] Le 29 avril 2014, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), la CCDP a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[3] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions contenant les d\u00e9tails de sa plainte. Les intim\u00e9s, m\u00eame s\u2019ils ont eu l\u2019occasion de le faire, n\u2019ont fourni aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte, ni communiqu\u00e9 aucun document. La plaignante a comparu pour son propre compte \u00e0 l\u2019audience et elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. M. Gill repr\u00e9sentait les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. La plaignante et M. Gill ont pu fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve utiles lors de l\u2019audience. Aucun autre t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9. La CCDP n\u2019a pas comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et n\u2019a formul\u00e9 aucune observation.\nI. La d\u00e9cision\n[4] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai conclu que la partie de la plainte all\u00e9guant un harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e0 titre d\u2019acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP avait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e. De plus, pour les motifs indiqu\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai conclu que la partie de la plainte all\u00e9guant une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e. Enfin, pour les motifs indiqu\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai conclu que la partie de la plainte all\u00e9guant une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e, et elle est rejet\u00e9e.\nII. Les faits\n[5] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la d\u00e9termination des faits a pos\u00e9 des d\u00e9fis consid\u00e9rables. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur important, car la plaignante et les intim\u00e9s ne s\u2019entendaient quant \u00e0 savoir si les faits en litige s\u2019\u00e9taient produits, et ce, pour bon nombre d\u2019entre eux. De plus, comme les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas pris part au processus de communication pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience, de nombreux documents qui auraient pu aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les faits n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les intim\u00e9s ont fait mention de documents qui tendaient \u00e0 \u00e9tayer leur position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des faits, mais ils n\u2019en ont produit aucun pour examen. En me fondant sur la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve testimoniale entendue, et apr\u00e8s avoir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des deux t\u00e9moins quant \u00e0 divers points ainsi qu\u2019examin\u00e9 la preuve documentaire que la plaignante a produite, j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 les conclusions de fait qui suivent.\n[6] Le 2 mai 2011, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour travailler comme vendeuse et g\u00e9rante au magasin de d\u00e9tail de la cha\u00eene Mobilicity, poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et exploit\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s et situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse suivante : 17e Avenue SE, \u00e0 Calgary (Alberta) (la \u00ab boutique de Mobilicity \u00bb). La plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 y travailler \u00e0 ce titre le 4 mai 2011. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 ans. Pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la boutique de Mobilicity, le particulier intim\u00e9, M. Gill, travaillait sur place deux ou trois jours par semaine. Pendant une bonne partie du temps o\u00f9 M. Gill \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, Mme Opheim travaillait seule avec lui. Cependant, outre M. Gill, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de ce dernier, Jasmin Gill, travaillait elle aussi \u00e0 la boutique de Mobilicity \u00e0 des occasions o\u00f9 la plaignante et M. Gill \u00e9taient tous deux pr\u00e9sents.\n[7] Au cours des deux premi\u00e8res semaines de travail de la plaignante, M. Gill a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui faire des remarques sexuellement explicites, dont les suivantes : [traduction] \u00ab Comment va ma travailleuse sexy? \u00bb, [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour, sexy \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab Tu es \u00e0 croquer aujourd\u2019hui \u00bb. Ces remarques sont devenues plus fr\u00e9quentes au cours de ces deux semaines. La plaignante a essay\u00e9 d\u2019en faire abstraction, mais les remarques se sont poursuivies et leur caract\u00e8re sexuel s\u2019est intensifi\u00e9.\n[8] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le 8 juin 2011, M. Gill et la plaignante s\u2019occupaient d\u2019ouvrir la boutique de Mobilicity. La plaignante avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que la boutique allait embaucher plus de personnel et qu\u2019elle allait de ce fait superviser ces employ\u00e9s et intensifier la partie \u00ab gestion \u00bb de son travail. Elle a donc demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gill si elle pouvait avoir une augmentation. Ce dernier a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 condition de me faire une pipe. \u00bb Il a ensuite descendu la fermeture \u00e9clair de son pantalon et s\u2019est mis \u00e0 rire. La plaignante a refus\u00e9 et a quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce.\n[9] En plus de cette demande sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e survenue le 8 juin 2011, les remarques \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel de M. Gill \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Opheim se sont intensifi\u00e9es et, au d\u00e9but du mois de juin 2011, elles ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 inclure des attouchements sexuels non sollicit\u00e9s, tout cela pendant que la plaignante \u00e9tait au service des intim\u00e9s. Au d\u00e9but du mois de juin 2011, M. Gill mettait la main sur les fesses de la plaignante, lui donnait des tapes sur les fesses et tentait de la saisir par les hanches et de l\u2019asseoir sur ses genoux. Chaque fois, elle lui demandait d\u2019arr\u00eater et il se moquait d\u2019elle. Ces attouchements sexuels non sollicit\u00e9s ont persist\u00e9 et sont devenus de plus en plus s\u00e9rieux, car M. Gill a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 remonter les mains le long de la jupe de la plaignante et \u00e0 lui toucher les seins.\n[10] Le 25 juin 2011, la plaignante s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la boutique de Mobilicity pour y travailler. Ce jour-l\u00e0, la boutique tenait une vente promotionnelle. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, elle \u00e9tait mise [traduction] \u00ab sur son trente-et-un \u00bb en pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019occasion. Elle portait donc, notamment, une jupe et des chaussures \u00e0 talons hauts. Plut\u00f4t que de travailler dans la boutique comme elle le pr\u00e9voyait, la plaignante s\u2019est vu demander par M. Gill d\u2019arpenter le trottoir devant la boutique, afin de distribuer des prospectus annon\u00e7ant la vente. Il lui a dit que, ce jour-l\u00e0, elle ne recevrait que des commissions de clients r\u00e9pondant aux prospectus, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu\u2019elle avait dit \u00e0 plusieurs clients de Mobilicity avec lesquels elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait affaire de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la boutique ce jour-l\u00e0 pour y faire des achats dans le cadre de la vente annonc\u00e9e.\n[11] La plaignante a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de lui faire arpenter le trottoir avait pour but de la faire passer pour [traduction] \u00ab vulgaire \u00bb et cela la mettait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la rue en question \u00e9tait, selon elle, passablement [traduction] \u00ab dure \u00bb et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont elle \u00e9tait v\u00eatue. Elle a fait part de son sentiment de g\u00eane \u00e0 M. Gill.\n[12] Il y a quelques divergences entre les intim\u00e9s et la plaignante \u00e0 propos de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e du 25 juin 2011, mais il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 un certain moment de la journ\u00e9e, Mme Opheim est all\u00e9e \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence, qui se trouvait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de la boutique de Mobilicity, pour y prendre des chaussures plus convenables, et que M. Gill le lui a reproch\u00e9. Mme Opheim a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait sentie oblig\u00e9e d\u2019aller chez elle pour changer de chaussures, car, dans ses chaussures \u00e0 talons hauts, elle n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 arpenter le trottoir. M. Gill a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne se conformait pas aux instructions qu\u2019il lui avait donn\u00e9es au sujet de son travail. Il est clair qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du quart de travail de la plaignante, le 25 juin 2011, cette derni\u00e8re et M. Gill ont eu, dans la boutique de Mobilicity, une discussion sur son travail ce jour-l\u00e0, ainsi que sur sa d\u00e9cision de quitter les lieux pour aller changer de chaussures.\n[13] Lors de cette discussion, la plaignante avait avec elle un agenda dans lequel elle consignait ses heures de travail. M. Gill a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de lui laisser l\u2019agenda afin qu\u2019il puisse consigner ses heures. Elle a refus\u00e9, disant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un bien personnel. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir quitt\u00e9 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle exer\u00e7ait aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s parce que, lors de cette discussion du 25 juin 2011, M. Gill avait menac\u00e9 de la cong\u00e9dier si elle ne lui laissait pas son agenda. Les intim\u00e9s affirment que M. Gill a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la plaignante lors de cette r\u00e9union \u00e0 cause du probl\u00e8me concernant son changement de chaussures et son refus de remettre l\u2019agenda.\n[14] Les parties conviennent qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la r\u00e9union, la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait plus au service des intim\u00e9s. Comme le fait de savoir si la plaignante a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 ou si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de cette r\u00e9union avec M. Gill ne tranche aucune des questions en litige, aucune d\u00e9cision n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[15] Mme Opheim a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en quittant la boutique le 25 juin 2011, elle s\u2019est entretenue avec l\u2019\u00e9pouse de M. Gill, Jasmin Gill, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente sur les lieux \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle lui a parl\u00e9 des commentaires, des demandes et des attouchements \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la part de M. Gill. La plaignante est ensuite partie. Les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas appel\u00e9 Jasmin Gill \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ni expliqu\u00e9 de quelque mani\u00e8re son absence.\n[16] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s ont embauch\u00e9 la plaignante, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que celle-ci gagnerait 10 $ par heure de travail effectu\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 44 heures par semaine, qu\u2019elle serait pay\u00e9e \u00e0 temps et demi pour les heures de travail effectu\u00e9es chaque semaine au-del\u00e0 du nombre de 44 heures et qu\u2019elle toucherait une commission de 10 % sur toutes les ventes qu\u2019elle effectuerait. Ces faits ne sont pas contest\u00e9s.\n[17] Tous les jours, \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la boutique de Mobilicity, Mme Opheim pr\u00e9parait la boutique en vue de son ouverture et se connectait \u00e0 son ordinateur, s\u2019inscrivant ainsi pour les besoins du syst\u00e8me de paie de l\u2019entreprise. Ce syst\u00e8me, exploit\u00e9 par le logiciel R24, s\u2019occupait de calculer les heures de travail \u00e0 payer en fonction des p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 la plaignante se connectait \u00e0 son ordinateur et s\u2019en d\u00e9connectait et il consignait aussi les commissions \u00e0 payer. Le syst\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9rait pour l\u2019employ\u00e9e des \u00ab Payroll Deductions Online Calculator Results \u00bb [R\u00e9sultats du calcul en ligne des retenues salariales]. Outre le syst\u00e8me R24 qu\u2019utilisaient les intim\u00e9s, la plaignante consignait \u00e9galement tous ses quarts de travail ainsi que ses heures de travail r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et accumul\u00e9es dans un agenda, qu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. C\u2019est cet agenda qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de son diff\u00e9rend avec M. Gill le 25 juin 2011.\n[18] Pour calculer ses dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour perte de salaire, la plaignante s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur plusieurs documents qu\u2019elle avait produits, dont les suivants : son agenda, le dossier R24, des copies de ch\u00e8ques qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7us de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, ses relev\u00e9s bancaires et deux calculs distincts des dommages subis, qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en vue de l\u2019audience. La plaignante disait avoir effectu\u00e9 38,5 heures de travail pour lesquelles elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. Elle a qualifi\u00e9 ces heures [traduction] d\u2019\u00ab heures accumul\u00e9es \u00bb. Cependant, elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve sur ce qu\u2019\u00e9taient les heures accumul\u00e9es, sur la mani\u00e8re dont celles-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 acquises, sur la mani\u00e8re dont ils (la plaignante ou les intim\u00e9s) \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s les utiliser, ainsi que sur le mode de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. La plaignante a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que certaines des heures accumul\u00e9es \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, mais elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve pour expliquer pourquoi elle r\u00e9clamait le paiement d\u2019heures accumul\u00e9es qui s\u2019ajoutaient au nombre total d\u2019heures de travail indiqu\u00e9 dans les dossiers R24.\n[19] Lorsqu\u2019on la consid\u00e8re dans son ensemble, la preuve documentaire est insuffisante pour montrer les montants qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 payer pour les heures accumul\u00e9es. Les quarts de travail que la plaignante a consign\u00e9s dans son agenda pour l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s concordent avec les inscriptions faites dans le dossier R24 pour lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e. La plaignante a produit des documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en vue de l\u2019audience et dans lesquels elle a inclus des calculs relatifs \u00e0 des montants qui lui \u00e9taient dus \u00e0 titre d\u2019heures accumul\u00e9es. Ces calculs ne peuvent pas \u00eatre concili\u00e9s avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui figurent dans l\u2019agenda et dans les dossiers R24. La plaignante n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve additionnelle qui justifiait la demande relative aux heures accumul\u00e9es. Je conclus donc que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e int\u00e9gralement pour la totalit\u00e9 des heures de travail r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et les commissions qu\u2019elle acquises au cours de son emploi aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s, et que la preuve n\u2019est pas suffisantes pour conclure qu\u2019une somme additionnelle lui est due \u00e0 titre d\u2019heures accumul\u00e9es.\n[20] Selon la preuve de la plaignante, preuve que les intim\u00e9s ne contestent pas, \u00e0 la fin de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s, elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi et n\u2019a donc pas pu demander des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi; elle a plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte d\u2019emprunter de l\u2019argent \u00e0 sa famille. La plaignante n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve au sujet des sommes qu\u2019il lui a fallu emprunter. Elle n\u2019a pas non plus fourni de preuve qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de ce qu\u2019elle avait v\u00e9cu aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s, elle \u00e9tait devenue d\u00e9prim\u00e9e et anxieuse, et qu\u2019elle avait pris des antid\u00e9presseurs en ao\u00fbt 2011. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de commencer \u00e0 prendre des antid\u00e9presseurs en ao\u00fbt 2011, il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de retourner travailler.\n[21] En ao\u00fbt 2011, la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans l\u2019entreprise familiale. Elle gagnait 15 $ l\u2019heure, mais ne travaillait que dix heures par semaine. En novembre 2011, le poste qui lui rapportait 15 $ l\u2019heure est devenu \u00e0 temps plein. La plaignante n\u2019a produit aucune preuve expliquant pourquoi elle avait travaill\u00e9 moins qu\u2019\u00e0 temps plein entre les mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt et de novembre 2011, et cela n\u2019inclut aucune preuve au sujet de l\u2019effet possible d\u2019une affection m\u00e9dicale quelconque. La plaignante a fourni des documents financiers concernant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s, mais elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve \u2013 sous la forme de d\u00e9clarations de revenus, de relev\u00e9s bancaires ou d\u2019autres documents financiers \u2013 \u00e0 l\u2019appui du revenu qu\u2019elle avait cens\u00e9ment perdu entre les mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt et de novembre 2011. De plus, elle n\u2019a produit aucune preuve au sujet des efforts qu\u2019elle avait faits pour trouver un emploi \u00e0 temps plein au cours de cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode.\nIII. Le droit applicable\n[22] Selon l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP, le sexe et l\u2019\u00e2ge sont des motifs de distinction illicite.\n[23] L\u2019article 14 de la LCDP \u00e9nonce l\u2019acte discriminatoire qui est li\u00e9 au harc\u00e8lement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 :\n14. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\n[\u2026]\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n(2) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu\u2019en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[24] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie au titre de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir que le particulier intim\u00e9 l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9crit le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en ces termes :\nSans chercher \u00e0 fournir une d\u00e9finition exhaustive de cette expression, j\u2019estime que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut se d\u00e9finir de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour les victimes du harc\u00e8lement. [\u2026] Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est une pratique d\u00e9gradante, qui inflige un grave affront \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s forc\u00e9s de le subir. En imposant \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 de faire face \u00e0 des gestes sexuels importuns ou \u00e0 des demandes sexuelles explicites, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel sur le lieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi, \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain.\n[25] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a explicit\u00e9 le raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et ce, dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, 1999 CanLII 18902 (CF), [1999] 3 RCF 653. Elle a conclu que, pour qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel soit confirm\u00e9e, les points qui suivent doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis :\n1) les actes qui constituent le fondement de la plainte doivent \u00eatre importuns, ou devraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9s importuns par une personne raisonnable;\n2) la conduite doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle;\n3) Normalement, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel exige un degr\u00e9 de persistance ou de gravit\u00e9 de la conduite, mais, dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9 ou hostile;\n4) lorsque le harc\u00e8lement sexuel a lieu dans un milieu de travail et que l\u2019employeur a un service du personnel et une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement sexuel efficace, la victime de harc\u00e8lement doit aviser l\u2019employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante.\n[26] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un autre acte discriminatoire li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n[\u2026]\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[27] Afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir que :\n(i) l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi;\n(ii) il existe un lien entre \u2013 d\u2019une part \u2013 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable de cette personne et \u2013 d\u2019autre part \u2013 un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP (voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39 (CanLII), au par. 52).\n[28] \u00c0 ce dernier \u00e9gard, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que des consid\u00e9rations de nature discriminatoire soient l\u2019unique motif des actes en litige pour qu\u2019une plainte soit retenue. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un facteur dans les gestes que pose l\u2019employeur ou les d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il prend (ibidem; Holden c. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.)).\n[29] Une preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9. \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons\u2011Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la p. 558). Une fois qu\u2019une plainte \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration en l\u2019absence de justification de la part de l\u2019employeur (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la p. 208; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au par. 18).\n[30] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a trait\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment du degr\u00e9 de preuve applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, dans le contexte de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec. La Cour a confirm\u00e9 que le plaignant devait satisfaire \u00e0 la norme de preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, et que le renvoi \u00e0 une preuve prima facie ne d\u00e9notait pas l\u2019existence d\u2019un fardeau de preuve moins lourd :\n[65] En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u00ab discrimination prima facie \u00bb ne doit pas \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 un all\u00e8gement de l\u2019obligation du demandeur de convaincre le tribunal selon la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, laquelle continue toujours de lui incomber. Le passage de l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley cit\u00e9 plus haut appuie d\u2019ailleurs cette conclusion. La Cour y affirme qu\u2019il faut une preuve \u00ab compl\u00e8te et suffisante \u00bb, soit une preuve qui correspond au degr\u00e9 de preuve requis en droit civil. Sauf exception pr\u00e9vue par la loi, il n\u2019existe en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qu\u2019un seul degr\u00e9 de preuve en mati\u00e8re civile, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s : art. 2804 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec; voir aussi Banque Canadienne Nationale c.

Les questions en litige\nDans quelle mesure la preuve de la plaignante \u00e9taye-t-elle l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de harc\u00e8lement sexuel en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, au sens de l\u2019article 14?\nDans quelle mesure la preuve de la plaignante \u00e9taye-t-elle l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b)?\nDans quelle mesure la preuve de la plaignante \u00e9taye-t-elle l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et de l\u2019article 14?\nS\u2019il est conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, la plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, au titre de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP?\ni) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP?\nii) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir cess\u00e9 de travailler pour les intim\u00e9s, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP?\niii) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour frais m\u00e9dicaux, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) de la LCDP?\niv) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP?\nv) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le comportement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s, au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP?\nV. Analyse\nA. La preuve prima facie de harc\u00e8lement sexuel\n[31] La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve claire et pr\u00e9cise, qui concordait avec les all\u00e9gations, formul\u00e9es dans sa plainte, au sujet du comportement sexuel, tant verbal que physique, auquel elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. Ce comportement sexuel se composait des gestes non sollicit\u00e9s et importuns qui suivent : des remarques, des attouchements et des demandes \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel ainsi que la demande sexualis\u00e9e et humiliante d\u2019arpenter le trottoir devant la boutique de Mobilicity. Le comportement en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois fr\u00e9quent et constant, pendant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service des intim\u00e9s. De plus, \u00e0 plusieurs occasions o\u00f9 le comportement sexuel a constitu\u00e9 une agression (cela inclut le fait d\u2019avoir touch\u00e9 les seins et les fesses de la plaignante ainsi que de remonter la main sous sa jupe), ce comportement a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment s\u00e9rieux pour constituer un harc\u00e8lement sexuel fond\u00e9 sur une occasion unique. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aviser l\u2019employeur de la situation, car il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve que l\u2019entreprise de Mobilicity avait soit un service du personnel soit une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Je conclus n\u00e9anmoins que la notification requise a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement donn\u00e9e, puisque M. Gill \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois l\u2019employeur responsable et le harceleur. Ce dernier \u00e9tait clairement au courant du comportement qui avait lieu ainsi que des objections formul\u00e9es par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce comportement.\n[32] Les intim\u00e9s ont fourni peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de fond pour r\u00e9futer le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. La seule preuve que M. Gill a donn\u00e9e lors de son interrogatoire principal sur ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 de dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait [traduction] \u00ab rien de sexuel \u00bb avec la plaignante et qu\u2019il ne [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019avait jamais touch\u00e9e \u00bb. Les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas contest\u00e9 la preuve de la plaignante lors du contre-interrogatoire de cette derni\u00e8re. Ils n\u2019ont pas trait\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019une quelconque des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises de remarques ou de demandes \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel, et M. Gill n\u2019a pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise, lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal ou en contre-interrogatoire, aux faits que la plaignante avait \u00e9tablis.\n[33] De plus, la seule autre personne \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de ces faits \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9pouse du particulier intim\u00e9, Jasmin Gill, mais les intim\u00e9s ne l\u2019ont pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. En particulier, ils ne l\u2019ont pas appel\u00e9e pour contester la preuve de la plaignante selon laquelle, le 25 juin 2011, cette derni\u00e8re lui avait d\u00e9voil\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de comportement sexuel qui constituent le fondement de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[34] Enfin, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont fourni aucune preuve documentaire tendant \u00e0 r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, ils ont dit qu\u2019ils avaient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des enregistrements vid\u00e9o de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, film\u00e9s dans la boutique de Mobilicity, qui exon\u00e9reraient M. Gill, mais ils n\u2019ont pas communiqu\u00e9 ces enregistrements avant l\u2019audience et ne les ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 cette occasion.\n[35] Je conclus que la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9taill\u00e9e au sujet des faits en question et que les d\u00e9tails concordaient avec ceux qu\u2019elle avait fournis dans sa plainte initiale ainsi que dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Je conclus aussi que la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re franche et directe, et que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tr\u00e8s restreints. Par ailleurs, j\u2019ai des r\u00e9serves au sujet du fait que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas appel\u00e9 Jasmin Gill, le seul autre t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9tendu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et du fait de ne pas avoir produit \u00e0 l\u2019audience les enregistrements vid\u00e9o qui, ont-ils indiqu\u00e9, les exon\u00e9reraient par rapport aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es. Compte tenu de tout cela, pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, y compris le comportement non sollicit\u00e9 et importun, comprenant des remarques, des attouchements et des demandes \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel ainsi que la demande de travail sexualis\u00e9e et humiliante, je privil\u00e9gie la preuve de la plaignante et je conclus que le particulier intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire en harcelant sexuellement la plaignante. Je conclus que, de plus, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la LCDP, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel de la plaignante aux mains du particulier intim\u00e9, est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e.\n[36] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en plus de toute pr\u00e9tention formul\u00e9e en accord avec l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel peut constituer une distinction d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP : Robichaud c. Brennan [1984] 2 C.F. 799, inf. pour d'autres motifs par [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Robichaud, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clairement indiqu\u00e9 que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e9tait un acte de discrimination fond\u00e9 sur le sexe (Janzen c. Platy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[37] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s dans les conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent au sujet de l\u2019article 14, je conclus que la mani\u00e8re dont les intim\u00e9s ont trait\u00e9 la plaignante constitue \u00e9galement une distinction d\u00e9favorable prima facie en cours d\u2019emploi, due au motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est le sexe, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\n[38] La plaignante indique aussi que la discrimination exerc\u00e9e, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, constitue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la caract\u00e9ristique de l\u2019\u00e2ge. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait que 18 ans \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le harc\u00e8lement a eu lieu. Cependant, \u00e0 part indiquer l\u2019\u00e2ge qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, la plaignante n\u2019a produit aucune autre preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il y avait un lien entre son \u00e2ge et un comportement quelconque de la part des intim\u00e9s. Une indication de son \u00e2ge, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e isol\u00e9ment, ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la norme de preuve \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination que la plaignante fonde sur le motif illicite de l\u2019\u00e2ge est rejet\u00e9e.\n[39] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime des actes discriminatoires que sont le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au titre de l\u2019article 14 et d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b), elle peut \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9. La plaignante demande un certain nombre de mesures de r\u00e9paration. Sa premi\u00e8re demande a trait \u00e0 des montants qui lui seraient dus sous la forme d\u2019un revenu impay\u00e9 au cours de sa p\u00e9riode de travail aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s. Ces montants ne peuvent pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9, car, au vu des faits, il semble qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a quitt\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s, la totalit\u00e9 des montants qui lui \u00e9taient dus lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de toute autre demande pour revenu impay\u00e9 au cours de son emploi \u00e9tait insuffisante.\n[40] Pour ce qui est des demandes concernant les montants \u00e0 lui payer pour le salaire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant du 25 juin au 1er novembre 2011, la plaignante n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de montant particulier. Elle n\u2019a pas non plus produit de preuve au sujet des efforts qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes en cherchant un emploi \u00e0 temps plein entre le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2011, o\u00f9 elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel, et le 1er novembre 2011, o\u00f9 elle avait obtenu un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a toutefois t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et je souscris \u00e0 ses propos, qu\u2019elle avait trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile la p\u00e9riode pass\u00e9e avec M. Gill et qu\u2019il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de retourner travailler avant qu\u2019elle commence \u00e0 prendre des antid\u00e9presseurs en ao\u00fbt 2011. Cependant, elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve sur la raison pour laquelle elle n\u2019avait fait que dix heures de travail par semaine entre le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt et le 1er novembre 2011. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible de travailler \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 cause d\u2019une affection m\u00e9dicale (que nous analyserons plus loin) ou qu\u2019elle avait cherch\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 temps plein, mais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d\u2019en trouver un.\n[41] Au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, ainsi que de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant \u00e0 ses gains ant\u00e9rieurs, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de la plaignante pour le salaire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e sera donc limit\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019un mois suivant la fin de son emploi aupr\u00e8s des intim\u00e9s. La plaignante a donc droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de 1 788 $ de la part des intim\u00e9s pour cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019un mois.\n[42] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait sentie d\u00e9prim\u00e9e et anxieuse apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part des intim\u00e9s, et qu\u2019elle aura \u00e0 prendre des antid\u00e9presseurs durant le reste de sa vie, \u00e0 un co\u00fbt d\u2019environ 135 $ par mois. Elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 toutefois que cette affection m\u00e9dicale avait entrav\u00e9 de quelque mani\u00e8re sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2011. De plus, elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve au sujet des points suivants : l\u2019apparition de cette affection, les sympt\u00f4mes qu\u2019elle subissait, si et quand elle avait obtenu un diagnostic \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette affection, et qu\u2019elles en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 les manifestations depuis qu\u2019elle avait cess\u00e9 de travailler pour les intim\u00e9s. De plus, la plaignante n\u2019a fourni aucun document m\u00e9dical confirmant le diagnostic ou les frais associ\u00e9s au traitement pour lesquels elle demande une indemnit\u00e9. Un manque de documents m\u00e9dicaux ne porte pas en soi un coup fatal \u00e0 une demande : voir la d\u00e9cision Canada (P.G.) c. Hicks, 2015 CF 599, au paragraphe 80. Cependant, le peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui \u00e9tayent cette all\u00e9gation dans son ensemble \u2013 y compris des documents m\u00e9dicaux confirmant le diagnostic et des documents financiers confirmant le co\u00fbt du traitement \u2013 est significatif. Je souscris au t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la situation. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas fourni suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention qu\u2019elle souffrait d\u2019une affection chronique et permanente, ainsi que des frais de traitement connexes. Par ailleurs, la preuve selon laquelle les frais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s \u2013 et continueront de l\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 \u00e0 cause des actes discriminatoires est insuffisante. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, il n\u2019y avait pas non plus de preuve suffisante pour montrer que la perte de revenus, apr\u00e8s le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2011, \u00e9tait due aux actes discriminatoires.\n[43] Je conclus que la plaignante a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de 7 500 $ de la part des intim\u00e9s, au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Pour ordonner le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 de ce montant, j\u2019ai tenu compte tout d\u2019abord du fait que, bien que la plaignante n\u2019ait pas pu d\u00e9montrer le co\u00fbt de son traitement contre la d\u00e9pression et l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, elle a manifestement souffert de cette affection \u00e0 cause du comportement des intim\u00e9s, et ce fait contribue \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019il convient de lui attribuer au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e). Voir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la d\u00e9cision Hunt c. Transport One, 2008 TCDP 23, aux paragraphes 45 \u00e0 47. De plus, bien que la plaignante n\u2019ait pas pu \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e2ge, son tr\u00e8s jeune \u00e2ge et l\u2019\u00e9tat de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 dans lequel elle se trouvait donc \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des faits en question sont des facteurs pertinents en vue de l\u2019attribution d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice psychologique dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Voir la d\u00e9cision Bouvier c. Metro Express, 1992 CanLII 1429 (TCDP), conf. par Canada (C.C.D.P.) c. Canada (T.D.P.) (1993) 72 F.T.R.\n[44] La plaignante a en outre droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de 12 000 $ de la part des intim\u00e9s au titre du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Ce montant de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats est accord\u00e9 au motif que les actes des intim\u00e9s, qui ont harcel\u00e9 sexuellement \u00e0 maintes reprises la plaignante et fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit du fait de son sexe, constituent un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Pour arriver \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai tenu compte du fait que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas un employeur de grande taille ou averti, et que le harc\u00e8lement s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode relativement br\u00e8ve. En revanche, j\u2019ai aussi tenu compte du fait que le harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieux et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait poursuivi malgr\u00e9 les demandes de la plaignante pour qu\u2019il cesse. Voir Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 21, au paragraphe 145.\n[45] Au vu de la conclusion que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 65 de la LCDP, \u00e0 savoir que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait responsable des actes du particulier intim\u00e9, les deux intim\u00e9s sont solidairement responsables de toutes les formes d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, voir la d\u00e9cision Bushey, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 16, ainsi que la d\u00e9cision Bouvier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[46] Ayant conclu que les all\u00e9gations que la plaignante avait formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9es en partie, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP, le Tribunal ordonne, en vertu de l\u2019article 53, ce qui suit :\nB. La preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe\nC. La preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge\nD. La r\u00e9paration\nVI.

Plainte accueillie 6\nVI. Ordonnance 7\nI. Plainte\n[1] Christina Green est la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle soutient que Trevor Thomas, l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement pendant un voyage li\u00e9 au travail, dans le camion de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en 2008. M. Thomas nie les all\u00e9gations.\n[2] La plainte est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [1] . L\u2019article 14 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu. Le paragraphe 14(2) pr\u00e9voit que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[3] Les deux parties ont agi pour leur propre compte \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les deux parties ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et elles ont chacune \u00e9t\u00e9 leur seul t\u00e9moin.\nII. \u00c9l\u00e9ments de harc\u00e8lement et de harc\u00e8lement sexuel\n[4] Mme Green doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement. Constitue du harc\u00e8lement n\u2019importe quel mot ou comportement qui est importun ou qui devrait \u00eatre connu comme tel. Il s\u2019agit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u2019actes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s ou persistants, bien qu\u2019un seul \u00e9v\u00e9nement puisse \u00eatre suffisant pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Le harc\u00e8lement est \u00e9tabli au cas par cas en appliquant la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), 1999 CanLII 18902 (CF) [Franke]).\n[5] Pour qu\u2019il constitue du harc\u00e8lement sexuel, le harc\u00e8lement doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle et il comprend : une demande et une proposition de faveurs sexuelles; le fait de pincer, empoigner, \u00e9treindre, embrasser et envoyer des regards concupiscents; le fait de prof\u00e9rer des insultes fond\u00e9es sur le sexe ou des remarques portant sur l\u2019apparence ou les habitudes sexuelles d\u2019une personne.\n[6] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd [2] .\n[L]e harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut se d\u00e9finir de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour les victimes du harc\u00e8lement. [\u2026] [L]e harc\u00e8lement sexuel sur le lieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi, \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain.\n[7] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, Section de premi\u00e8re instance, a \u00e9tabli la d\u00e9finition suivante dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (CDP) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke [3] . La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour qu\u2019une plainte de harc\u00e8lement soit fond\u00e9e, il faut d\u00e9montrer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n[traduction]\n(i) Le comportement contest\u00e9 doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle. Les demandes ou les propositions de faveurs sexuelles sont de nature sexuelle et constituent une forme psychologique de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Le harc\u00e8lement peut aussi \u00eatre physique, par exemple le fait de pincer, d\u2019empoigner, d\u2019\u00e9treindre, d\u2019embrasser ou d\u2019envoyer des regards concupiscents. Les actes peuvent \u00eatre de nature verbale, comprenant des insultes sexistes ou des remarques au sujet de l\u2019apparence ou des habitudes sexuelles d\u2019une personne. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 ce qui est de \u00ab nature sexuelle \u00bb est fond\u00e9e sur la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire, en fonction des normes sociales dominantes.\n(ii) La conduite qui fait l\u2019objet de la plainte \u00e9tait importune. En d\u2019autres mots, il faut d\u00e9terminer si la conduite du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 harceleur \u00e9tait d\u00e9sir\u00e9e ou sollicit\u00e9e. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la conduite est importune, le Tribunal tient compte de la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement en question s\u2019est produit et d\u00e9termine si celle\u2011ci a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9montr\u00e9, par son comportement, que la conduite \u00e9tait importune. La Cour a cependant reconnu qu\u2019un refus verbal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire dans tous les cas et que le fait d\u2019omettre \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires suggestifs signale \u00e0 l\u2019auteur du harc\u00e8lement que sa conduite est importune. En pareil cas, la norme \u00e0 appliquer en vue d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la conduite est celle de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances.\n(iii) D\u2019habitude, le harc\u00e8lement exige la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, m\u00eame si dans certaines circonstances un seul incident suffit, par exemple une agression physique, peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Ici encore, le juge des faits appliquera la norme de la personne raisonnable dans le contexte de l\u2019affaire.\n[8] Ensemble, l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen et la d\u00e9cision Franke d\u00e9finissent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis dans la preuve de Mme Green pour que je puisse conclure que M. Thomas l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement pendant leur voyage li\u00e9 au travail, dans son camion, en avril 2008.\nIII. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Green\n[9] Mme Green \u00e9tait camionneuse en Alberta. Elle avait un contrat avec KEE Management Solutions Inc., qui embauchait des camionneurs pour Quik\u2011X Transportation. M. Thomas avait aussi un contrat avec KEE, mais il conduisait pour TransX Limited.\n[10] Aucune question n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e au sujet de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019entendre la plainte, y compris le fait que la plainte comportait des litiges en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e non plus.\n[11] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Green, le 1er avril 2008, elle s\u2019est rendue au bureau de KEE \u00e0 Calgary pour obtenir un billet d\u2019avion pour se rendre \u00e0 Langley, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, o\u00f9 elle devait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un camion en attente et ramener son chargement \u00e0 Calgary. Le gestionnaire de bureau de KEE a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Green que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui avait dit, Quik-X n\u2019avait pas laiss\u00e9 de billet d\u2019avion pour elle.\n[12] M. Thomas se trouvait au bureau de KEE au m\u00eame moment. Il a entendu la conversation et il a offert d\u2019amener Mme Green \u00e0 Langley dans son camion, puisqu\u2019il devait s\u2019y rendre dans les prochains jours. Mme Green a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre avec r\u00e9ticence, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autre moyen de se rendre \u00e0 Langley. Ils ont pris le camion de M. Thomas et sont partis dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi du 1er avril 2008.\n[13] Mme Green soutient qu\u2019au d\u00e9part, le voyage s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 sans probl\u00e8me, ils discutaient de questions li\u00e9es au travail de camionneur. Cependant, elle d\u00e9clare qu\u2019avant qu\u2019ils arrivent \u00e0 Banff, la discussion a chang\u00e9 vers un sujet sexuel et que M. Thomas lui a demand\u00e9 de lui faire une fellation. Mme Green d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a repouss\u00e9 ses avances, a jur\u00e9 et l\u2019a menac\u00e9 de porter plainte contre lui s\u2019il continuait.\n[14] Mme Green soutient que, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, elle a voulu se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la cabine du camion pour se reposer. Elle explique qu\u2019alors qu\u2019elle se dirigeait vers l\u2019arri\u00e8re du camion, M. Thomas lui a montr\u00e9 des photos d\u2019une femme aux cheveux bruns et du p\u00e9nis d\u2019un homme. Mme Green d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a expliqu\u00e9 que les personnes sur les photos \u00e9taient son \u00e9pouse et lui-m\u00eame. Elle soutient que M. Thomas a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des commentaires sexuels au sujet, notamment, de la taille de son p\u00e9nis et des seins de Mme Green. Elle d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a aussi offert d\u2019arr\u00eater le camion sur le bord de la route et de lui faire un cunnilingus. Elle a refus\u00e9 et elle s\u2019est rendue \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du camion pour se reposer.\n[15] Mme Green soutient que, lorsqu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de retourner \u00e0 l\u2019avant pour s\u2019asseoir dans le si\u00e8ge du passager, M. Thomas lui a pris la fesse gauche avec sa main. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle a repouss\u00e9 sa main. Elle d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a attrap\u00e9 sa fesse une deuxi\u00e8me fois et l\u2019a serr\u00e9e. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle s\u2019est lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle s\u2019est assise dans le si\u00e8ge du passager.\n[16] M. Thomas a arr\u00eat\u00e9 le camion \u00e0 Golden, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, pour un court repos. Mme Green a dormi dans le lit du haut et M. Thomas a dormi dans le lit du bas. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il dormait nu. Aucune autre interaction verbale ou physique n\u2019a eu lieu pendant cet arr\u00eat.\n[17] Le voyage s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils s\u2019arr\u00eatent pour dormir au relais routier Husky \u00e0 Sicamous, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, t\u00f4t le 2 avril. Mme Green soutient que, lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e, elle a tent\u00e9 de descendre silencieusement du lit du haut sans r\u00e9veiller M. Thomas. Elle dit que, alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 mi-chemin, elle s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019il se tenait derri\u00e8re elle. Il a mis ses mains sur la taille de Mme Green et lui a dit qu\u2019il l\u2019aiderait \u00e0 descendre. Mme Green d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de remonter sur le lit du haut, mais qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas se lib\u00e9rer, il la tenait par la taille. Mme Green soutient qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas \u00eatre pr\u00e8s de M. Thomas, parce qu\u2019elle croyait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait nu.\n[18] Mme Green soutient qu\u2019elle a saut\u00e9 en bas du lit en tournant le dos \u00e0 M. Thomas. M. Thomas la tenait toujours par la taille. Elle d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il frottait son p\u00e9nis en \u00e9rection contre son dos et qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la soulever du sol. Elle a cri\u00e9, a jur\u00e9 et lui a ordonn\u00e9 de la rel\u00e2cher. Elle craignait qu\u2019il la viole, une agression qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 subie lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait adolescente. Apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9battue, elle s\u2019est lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et a couru se r\u00e9fugier dans la toilette du relais routier Husky. Elle \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9e et pleurait.\n[19] Mme Green a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son conjoint Chris May et lui a dit ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Elle ne voulait pas causer de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 M. Thomas, malgr\u00e9 ce qui venait de se produire. Elle craignait aussi de perdre son emploi et elle avait besoin de son salaire. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retourner au camion et de terminer le voyage. Suivant les conseils de M. May, elle a compos\u00e9 le 911 sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et elle a dit \u00e0 M. Thomas qu\u2019elle appellerait les secours s\u2019il tentait de lui faire d\u2019autres avances sexuelles. Ils se sont rendus \u00e0 Langley sans autre incident.\n[20] Mme Green a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait par la suite rapport\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 KEE et \u00e0 Quik\u2011X. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aux policiers.\n[21] Mme Green a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pris trois mois de cong\u00e9 pour se remettre de cet incident. Lorsqu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec KEE apr\u00e8s trois mois, on lui a dit qu\u2019elle ne travaillait plus pour l\u2019entreprise. Elle n\u2019a plus travaill\u00e9 dans le domaine du camionnage depuis et elle a eu beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se trouver un emploi ou \u00e0 garder les emplois qu\u2019elle a obtenus.\nIV. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Thomas\n[22] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Thomas concorde avec celui de Mme Green au sujet du d\u00e9but du voyage. Il a reconnu qu\u2019il lui avait offert de la transporter dans son camion jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Langley alors qu\u2019ils se trouvaient dans le bureau de KEE \u00e0 Calgary.\n[23] M. Thomas a admis que, pendant le voyage, certaines de ses paroles \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel envers Mme Green \u00e9taient inappropri\u00e9es. Il a admis lui avoir dit qu\u2019il dormait nu dans son camion. Quant aux actes pr\u00e9cis de harc\u00e8lement sexuel que Mme Green a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, il nie avoir agi de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[24] Par exemple, il nie avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Green de lui faire une fellation ou de lui avoir offert un cunnilingus. Il nie lui avoir montr\u00e9 des photos nues de son \u00e9pouse et de lui\u2011m\u00eame. Il nie s\u2019\u00eatre tenu derri\u00e8re elle nu et l\u2019avoir attrap\u00e9 par la taille alors qu\u2019elle tentait de descendre du lit du haut dans le camion.\n[25] M. Thomas soutient que, quand le voyage s\u2019est termin\u00e9 \u00e0 Langley, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 Mme Green \u00e0 sa destination et ils se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on normale.\nV. Plainte accueillie\n[26] Je suis convaincu en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qu\u2019il y a bien eu du harc\u00e8lement sexuel comme le soutient Mme Green. Ses observations et sa preuve au cours du processus de plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e9taient claires et coh\u00e9rentes. Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, elle a fourni des d\u00e9tails du harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re franche, sans enjolivement ni incoh\u00e9rence.\n[27] M. Thomas a \u00e9t\u00e9 un participant r\u00e9ticent dans le processus. Il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et a fourni tr\u00e8s peu de d\u00e9tails lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Ses deux admissions au sujet de discussions sexuelles inappropri\u00e9es et de sa pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 dormir nu dans son camion concordent avec la version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de Mme Green. Autrement, il n\u2019a fait que nier que les incidents d\u00e9crits par Mme Green se sont produits.\n[28] Lorsqu\u2019il a eu l\u2019occasion de contester le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Green en contre\u2011interrogatoire, il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Il lui a simplement demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas imm\u00e9diatement appel\u00e9 la police.\n[29] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, il a sous-entendu que Mme Green avait la possibilit\u00e9 de se rendre \u00e0 Langley le lendemain avec un ami qui travaillait pour Quik\u2011X, mais qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019y rendre avec lui le 1er avril. Cependant, m\u00eame si ce fait \u00e9tait vrai, cela ne changerait pas mon appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, y compris les affirmations de Mme Green selon lesquelles elle a dit \u00e0 M. Thomas que son comportement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bienvenu.\n[30] Je ne suis pas convaincu par le d\u00e9ni g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Thomas que la majorit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de Mme Green ne se sont pas produites. Je suis plut\u00f4t convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les paroles et les actes de M. Thomas lors de ce voyage li\u00e9 au travail \u00e9taient de nature sexuelle, qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient persistants et qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient mal re\u00e7us par Mme Green. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comment elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9motionnellement affect\u00e9e par le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, qui a eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur sa dignit\u00e9 et son respect de soi en tant qu\u2019\u00eatre humain.\n[31] En fonction de toute la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je conclus que M. Thomas a harcel\u00e9 sexuellement Mme Green, en contravention de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\nVI. Ordonnance\n[32] Mme Green demande 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 par M. Thomas, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, et 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), parce que les actes \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[33] Mme Green n\u2019a plus travaill\u00e9 dans un poste similaire dans l\u2019industrie du camionnage depuis le harc\u00e8lement sexuel qu\u2019elle a subi en 2008. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison du harc\u00e8lement sexuel, elle a eu besoin de prendre trois mois de cong\u00e9 pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se trouver un emploi semblable lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de reprendre sa carri\u00e8re. Elle a travaill\u00e9 dans divers autres emplois moins r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateurs. Son union de fait s\u2019est dissoute, et elle a souffert de divers probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[34] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire et j\u2019ai tenu compte de la jurisprudence dominante sur les dommages non p\u00e9cuniaires dans les d\u00e9cisions Goodwin c. Birkett [4] et Boushey c. Sharma [5] . Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Robichaud c Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), la loi ne vise pas \u00e0 punir la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, mais \u00e0 \u00e9liminer, autant que possible, les effets discriminatoires de l\u2019acte [6] . J\u2019ai tenu compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Je conclus que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel dont a fait preuve M. Thomas a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 Mme Green. Les paroles et les actes de M. Thomas ont caus\u00e9 du stress, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et un choc \u00e9motionnel \u00e0 Mme Green lors du voyage et pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s le voyage, au point o\u00f9 elle a senti qu\u2019elle devait prendre trois mois de cong\u00e9. Bien que le harc\u00e8lement ne se soit produit que pendant le voyage, ses effets sur Mme Green ont dur\u00e9 plus longtemps que cette p\u00e9riode et ont eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur sa sant\u00e9 mentale. Le harc\u00e8lement peut avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de sa relation avec son conjoint de fait et \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 subs\u00e9quents. Pour le pr\u00e9judice moral, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 Mme Green la somme de 5000 $ \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9dommagement.\n[35] Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les actes de M. Thomas \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les directives de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone [7] ,\nPour conclure que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, il faut que l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne aient \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels. On entend par \u00ab acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante.\nJe ne crois pas que les actes de M. Thomas \u00e9taient intentionnels, mais il n\u2019a pas tenu compte des effets de ses actes sur Mme Green, ou il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 ce sujet. Le harc\u00e8lement s\u2019est limit\u00e9 au voyage et ne s\u2019est pas reproduit, mais il a eu des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives sur Mme Green. Je conclus que le comportement de M. Thomas \u00e9tait inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 Mme Green la somme de 2500 $.\n[36] Mme Green a aussi r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un montant pour la perte du salaire qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7u si le harc\u00e8lement sexuel n\u2019avait pas eu lieu. Je conclus que, si M. Thomas n\u2019avait pas agi de la sorte, Mme Green n\u2019aurait pas pris trois mois de cong\u00e9 en 2008. Je lui accorde trois mois de pertes de salaire. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de revenu que Mme Green a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve et j\u2019utilise sa d\u00e9claration de revenus de 2007 comme base pour quantifier le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. En 2007, son revenu \u00e9tait de 22 773 $, sa moyenne mensuelle \u00e9tait donc de 1897,75 $. J\u2019ai \u00e9tabli le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire pendant trois mois \u00e0 5693,25 $. Je conclus que la perte de salaire que Mme Green a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e pour les p\u00e9riodes subs\u00e9quentes est trop \u00e9loign\u00e9e pour \u00eatre li\u00e9e au harc\u00e8lement sexuel qu\u2019elle a subi en 2008. Je note qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de se trouver divers autres emplois. Je note aussi que son m\u00e9decin a \u00e9tabli \u00e0 son endroit un diagnostic de fibromyalgie et de lupus en 2010, maladies qui peuvent avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver et \u00e0 garder un emploi stable.\n[37] Mme Green a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations pour divers autres frais accessoires, comme des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et des frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa recherche d\u2019emploi. Je conclus que ces frais sont aussi trop \u00e9loign\u00e9s pour \u00eatre li\u00e9s au harc\u00e8lement qu\u2019elle a subi, et je n\u2019accorde aucune indemnit\u00e9 pour ces r\u00e9clamations.\n[38] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples seront applicables aux indemnit\u00e9s p\u00e9cuniaires, calcul\u00e9s annuellement, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d\u2019escompte (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sera appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du 4 avril 2008 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\nSign\u00e9 par\nAlex G.

Introduction\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) et selon laquelle l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant du fait de son \u00e2ge et de sa d\u00e9ficience en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de r\u00e9duction du nombre d\u2019heures de travail. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 a fait preuve d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement, l\u2019a licenci\u00e9 et a \u00e9tabli une ligne de conduite discriminatoire, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 la Loi. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 28 mai 2015, et cette derni\u00e8re a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle prendrait part \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nII. Le contexte\n[2] Le plaignant a tout d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Mme Kathy Finstad (non-avocate). L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tout au long de l\u2019affaire par Me Aaron Crangle. L\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite au r\u00f4le pour instruction du 6 au 10 juin ainsi que les 13 et 17 juin 2016, \u00e0 Toronto, en Ontario. Me Daniel Poulin est avocat au service de la Commission. Il a r\u00e9cemment fait savoir que cette derni\u00e8re avait r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa position et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[3] Le 28 avril 2016, Me Nikolay Chsherbinin a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission que l\u2019on avait retenu ses services pour repr\u00e9senter le plaignant.\n[4] Le 30 mai 2016, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit au Tribunal et aux autres avocats pour demander que l\u2019on ajourne les dates d\u2019instruction pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 cause de renseignements qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7us de l\u2019avocat du plaignant le 19 mai 2016. Le plaignant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement, et une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (\u00ab CTGI \u00bb) a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e pour le 2 juin 2016.\n[5] \u00c0 la CTGI du 2 juin 2016, les avocats ont convenu d\u2019annuler la premi\u00e8re semaine de l\u2019instruction, soit la p\u00e9riode du 6 au 10 juin 2016. Une autre CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour le 9 juin 2016 en vue de confirmer que l\u2019\u00e9change des listes de t\u00e9moins, des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s et de renseignements \u00e9tait termin\u00e9, de sorte que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019instruction du 13 au 17 juin 2016 pouvait avoir lieu en vue d\u2019entendre les preuves du plaignant et de la Commission et de fixer, au besoin, d\u2019autres jours d\u2019instruction en ao\u00fbt 2016 pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse pr\u00e9senter sa position.\n[6] Le 7 juin 2016, en pr\u00e9vision de la CTGI pr\u00e9vue pour le 9 juin 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal et aux autres avocats pour signaler que le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant, la Dre Filomena Bautista, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrite sur la liste des t\u00e9moins du plaignant. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Le contenu des rapports de ce m\u00e9decin est tr\u00e8s contest\u00e9 et a trait \u00e0 une question centrale de la demande. La justice naturelle exige que l\u2019on donne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier la fiabilit\u00e9 et la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la preuve du demandeur dans le cadre d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire \u00bb.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal refuse d\u2019admettre en preuve les dossiers et les rapports m\u00e9dicaux de la Dre Bautista et qu\u2019il envisage, d\u2019une part, de rejeter le dossier du plaignant parce que ce dernier avait omis d\u2019appeler la Dre Bautista comme t\u00e9moin et, d\u2019autre part, d\u2019exclure ses dossiers et ses rapports m\u00e9dicaux, ce qui ne lui donnerait aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[8] Le 9 juin 2016, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 si l\u2019on r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9occupations si le plaignant faisait en sorte que la Dre Bautista puisse \u00eatre contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e, et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il en serait satisfait. Le plaignant a convenu de coordonner la date du contre-interrogatoire avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Dre Bautista, lequel allait vraisemblablement avoir lieu au cours de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019instruction fix\u00e9e en ao\u00fbt 2016. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas tenue de me prononcer sur la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[9] Le 8 juin 2016, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait savoir qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de retenir les services du Dr Brett Belchetz, \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert, en vue de passer en revue et de critiquer les documents m\u00e9dicaux, les constatations, les opinions, etc. de la Dre Bautista, le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant, et ce, dans un rapport \u00e9crit qui serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le cadre de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2016.\n[10] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris que l\u2019intim\u00e9 qualifie la preuve du Dr Belchetz de [traduction] \u00ab preuve d\u2019expert \u00bb car il avait fait savoir plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une preuve de cette nature. L\u2019avocat du plaignant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 au rapport d\u2019expert propos\u00e9 et il s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de sa preuve le 13 juin 2016 sans qu\u2019il ait re\u00e7u et examin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable le rapport d\u2019expert. L\u2019avocat de la Commission ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande du plaignant au sujet d\u2019un ajournement de l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2016 et il a fait savoir qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le rapport d\u2019expert serait produit bien avant les dates d\u2019instruction fix\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016, ce rapport \u00e9tait fourni conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles et il n\u2019y voyait aucune objection.\n[11] \u00c0 la CTGI du 9 juin 2016, les dates d\u2019instruction du 13 au 17 juin 2016 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau report\u00e9es \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode du 22 au 26 ao\u00fbt et du 29 ao\u00fbt au 2 septembre 2016, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner le rapport d\u2019expert du Dr Belchetz et de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019exclure le rapport et la preuve de l\u2019expert. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 fournir le rapport d\u2019expert avant le 24 juin 2016. Les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience, s\u2019il y en avait, devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant le 8 juillet 2016. La CTGI suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 11 juillet 2016. Le Tribunal a remis aux avocats le texte d\u2019un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (la \u00ab CSC \u00bb) : White Burgess Langille Inman c. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 CSC 23 (\u00ab White Burgess \u00bb), relativement au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, en vue d\u2019exclure la preuve d\u2019expert du Dr Belchetz.\n[12] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate le 8 juillet 2016, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai pour pouvoir d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse. Le 11 juillet 2016, une br\u00e8ve CTGI a eu lieu pour confirmer les dates auxquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission r\u00e9pondraient \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, et une CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 20 juillet 2016 en vue de discuter de la requ\u00eate et, peut-\u00eatre, de la trancher.\n[13] Le 20 juillet 2016, j\u2019ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont je comprenais la requ\u00eate et les r\u00e9ponses en vue d\u2019\u00eatre certaine de bien saisir les arguments des parties. Les avocats ont confirm\u00e9 ce que j\u2019avais compris et ils ont explicit\u00e9 leurs observations. J\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 que j\u2019avais besoin de plus de temps pour examiner la jurisprudence et me prononcer sur la requ\u00eate. J\u2019ai fait savoir que je ferais de mon mieux pour rendre la d\u00e9cision avant le 8 ao\u00fbt 2016, et j\u2019ai invit\u00e9 les avocats \u00e0 me soumettre d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments jurisprudentiels, s\u2019il y en avait, avant le 29 juillet 2016.\nIII. La requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 exclure la preuve du Dr Belchetz (la \u00ab requ\u00eate \u00bb)\n[14] La requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance excluant la lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 juillet 2016 (le \u00ab rapport \u00bb) et le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix du Dr Brett Belchetz, que celui-ci soit reconnu comme [traduction] \u00ab expert \u00bb ou pas.\n[15] Les motifs de la requ\u00eate sont les suivants :\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, dat\u00e9 du 9 novembre 2015, que le plaignant avait fourni assez de documents m\u00e9dicaux pour indiquer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 conduire, de sorte qu\u2019il ne devrait plus s\u2019agir d\u2019une question litigieuse;\ncontrairement \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 a qualifi\u00e9 la preuve du Dr Belchetz lors de la CTGI du 9 juin 2016, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une critique du diagnostic, du pronostic, des \u00e9valuations et de la tenue de documents de la Dre Bautista, la lettre du Dr Belchetz \u00e9tait plus qu\u2019une simple critique et critiquait s\u00e9v\u00e8rement le diagnostic, le pronostic, les \u00e9valuations et la tenue de documents de la Dre Bautista;\nle curriculum vit\u00e6 du Dr Belchetz ne faisait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune formation ou exp\u00e9rience en formation ou en \u00e9valuation du niveau de soins d\u2019un autre m\u00e9decin;\nle Dr Belchetz a critiqu\u00e9 les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de la Dre Bautista mais il n\u2019a pas fait de commentaires sur l\u2019exactitude de son diagnostic concernant le plaignant, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019a lui-m\u00eame \u00e9valu\u00e9 le diagnostic ou l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 travailler du plaignant pendant une dur\u00e9e de 40 \u00e0 45 heures par semaine, voire pas du tout;\nle Dr Belchetz n\u2019est pas le m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant et n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 aucune \u00e9valuation ou recherche par lui-m\u00eame, pas plus qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est entretenu avec la Dre Bautista. Son rapport repose sur des hypoth\u00e8ses, des conjectures et du ou\u00ef-dire;\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a retenu les services du Dr Belchetz que pour fournir une preuve d\u2019opinion dans le cadre du proc\u00e8s, et il est donc un [traduction] \u00ab homme de main \u00bb, qui a con\u00e7u son rapport en vue de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et non pour aider le Tribunal.\n[16] Le plaignant a appuy\u00e9 son argumentation sur les d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles suivantes : White Burgess, Meady c. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp., 2015 ONCA 6, Westerhoff, et Anderson c. Canada.\n[17] Le plaignant a pri\u00e9 le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport et du t\u00e9moignage de vive voix du Dr Belchetz avant l\u2019instruction, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019admettre le rapport ou le t\u00e9moignage et de d\u00e9terminer quel poids, si poids il y avait, devrait leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction. Il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux arr\u00eats White Burgess et Meady \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande en vue d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve avant l\u2019instruction.\n[18] Le plaignant a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess : 1) la pertinence; 2) la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits; 3) l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion; 4) la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert.\n[19] Citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Westerhoff, le plaignant fait une distinction entre la Dre Bautista, la m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant, et le Dr Belchetz, qui est un [traduction] \u00ab expert en mati\u00e8re de litige \u00bb. Le plaignant soutient que la Dre Bautista est un t\u00e9moin expert participant qui peut fournir une preuve de fait et une preuve d\u2019opinion en se basant sur sa connaissance du plaignant et sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de son \u00e9tat, en tant que m\u00e9decin traitant. Les services du Dr Belchetz ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus en juin 2016 \u00e0 seule fin d\u2019exprimer une preuve d\u2019opinion destin\u00e9e \u00e0 aider l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Dr Belchetz n\u2019a eu aucun rapport direct avec le plaignant ou l\u2019intim\u00e9, pendant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement. Le plaignant soutient que, dans son rapport, le Dr Belchetz s\u2019attribue manifestement le r\u00f4le de d\u00e9fenseur de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[20] Le plaignant met en doute la pertinence et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la preuve du Dr Belchetz \u00e0 cause du r\u00f4le manifeste de d\u00e9fenseur qu\u2019il joue pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de l\u2019absence de titres de comp\u00e9tence qui lui permettraient de donner un avis critique sur la norme de soins et les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s diagnostiques de la Dre Bautista. Le plaignant demande au Tribunal d\u2019exclure la preuve du Dr Belchetz, qu\u2019il soit reconnu comme expert ou pas, car les critiques n\u00e9gatives, peu fiables et injustifi\u00e9es que ce dernier a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 propos de la Dre Bautista lui portent pr\u00e9judice.\nIV. Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 exclure la preuve du Dr Belchetz\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les notes et les rapports de la Dre Bautista qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb; ils font plut\u00f4t r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 du stress, de la fatigue et de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Il explique que pour pouvoir se d\u00e9fendre contre la plainte, il a demand\u00e9 en 2015 qu\u2019on lui communique les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la Dre Bautista qui \u00e9tayent les notes et les rapports que celle-ci lui avait transmis. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu avoir re\u00e7u les documents en septembre 2015 et s\u2019\u00eatre report\u00e9 aux notes et aux rapports de la Dre Bautista pour r\u00e9diger l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (l\u2019\u00ab EP \u00bb) ainsi que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 (l\u2019\u00ab EPM) de son client.\n[22] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique qu\u2019il a :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] retenu les services du Dr Brett Belchetz pour examiner, \u00e0 titre d\u2019homologue, les notes cliniques et les dossiers de la Dre Bautista. Dans son rapport, le Dr Belchetz a soulev\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieux doutes \u00e0 propos du fait que la Dre Bautista n\u2019avait consign\u00e9 aucun diagnostic objectif dans ses notes cliniques et ses dossiers, lesquels servent de fondement aux notes de m\u00e9decin fournies \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour demander que l\u2019on prenne des mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[23] L\u2019intim\u00e9 signale par ailleurs que le Dr Belchetz a eu de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves quant au fait que la Dre Bautista n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou au minist\u00e8re des Transports des renseignements indiquant que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas apte \u00e0 travailler ou \u00e0 travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la preuve du Dr Belchetz \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab extr\u00eamement pertinente \u00bb, qu\u2019elle contenait des renseignements qui d\u00e9bordaient vraisemblablement le cadre de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et des connaissances du Tribunal, et qu\u2019elle aiderait celui-ci \u00e0 comprendre [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] les notes m\u00e9dicales et les questions soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant, de m\u00eame que l\u2019obligation qu\u2019avait l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement ou non, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal puisse avoir tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour trancher l\u2019affaire de mani\u00e8re objective \u00bb.\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 que les R\u00e8gles autorisent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des preuves et des renseignements qu\u2019un tribunal peut d\u00e9cider de ne pas admettre.\n[26] Comme l\u2019indique l\u2019intim\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab [d]e plus, un t\u00e9moin expert peut \u00eatre un m\u00e9decin qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un examen du type \u201cexamen par les pairs\u201d. Les commentaires critiques du Dr Belchetz sont utiles au Tribunal, et le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Il y aurait donc lieu d\u2019autoriser l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9poser son rapport \u00e0 l\u2019instruction et \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre pleinement. \u00bb\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 cite la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Kelsh c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique, 2016 TCDP 9 (\u00ab Kelsh \u00bb), aux paragraphes 17 \u00e0 22, ainsi que l\u2019examen du paragraphe 50(1), de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (3)c) et du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, de m\u00eame que l\u2019article 1 des R\u00e8gles \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son affirmation selon laquelle la preuve du Dr Belchetz qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e cadre avec son droit de jouir d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de formuler des observations \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a rendue la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Nassiah c. Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 HRTO 18 (CanLII), au paragraphe 354, \u00e0 l\u2019appui du principe suivant :\n[traduction]\nToute incertitude quant au fait de savoir si la preuve peut \u00eatre pertinente doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solue en faveur de son admission et de la possibilit\u00e9 de la v\u00e9rifier par un contre-interrogatoire. Le fait d\u2019admettre la preuve n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la Commission de d\u00e9terminer par la suite que cette preuve n\u2019est pas pertinente ou de ne lui attribuer aucun poids [\u2026] il n\u2019y a pas lieu de juger la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une norme trop stricte.\n[citant les par. 31 et 33 de la d\u00e9cision Radek c. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. [2004] B.C.H.R.T.D. No 364]\n[29] Se fondant sur la d\u00e9cision Kelsh, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019on ne cause aucun pr\u00e9judice au plaignant, car celui-ci a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser un rapport de r\u00e9ponse, mais il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[30] Citant la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2012 TCDP 28 (SSEFPN), aux paragraphes 11, 14, 15, et 18, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir ceci :\n[traduction]\nIl convient particuli\u00e8rement d\u2019attendre que le t\u00e9moin soit cit\u00e9 avant de se prononcer sur les questions ayant trait \u00e0 la pertinence et \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert. Le membre instructeur peut ensuite d\u00e9cider quel poids il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la preuve des m\u00e9decins respectifs. La requ\u00eate du plaignant est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, et il faudrait la rejeter.\n[31] En ce qui concerne les affaires mentionn\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 les a rejet\u00e9es pour cause d\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9, car il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9manant d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice, dont les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont plus stricts que ceux du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[32] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que la preuve du Dr Belchetz est pertinente et n\u00e9cessaire puisque les questions soulev\u00e9es d\u00e9bordent vraisemblablement le cadre de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et des connaissances du Tribunal. Il a fait remarquer que le Dr Belchetz a produit un formulaire d\u2019attestation de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert sign\u00e9 de sa main, qui indique qu\u2019il fournira un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion impartial, et que la Dre Bautista ne l\u2019a pas fait.\nV. Les observations de la Commission sur la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 exclure la preuve du Dr Belchetz\n[33] La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la preuve du Dr Belchetz. Elle a fait remarquer que son rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re prescrite par l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles. Elle a fait valoir que le Tribunal se doit de d\u00e9cider quel poids il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 cette preuve.\n[34] La Commission a soutenu par ailleurs :\n[traduction]\nRejeter le ou les rapports, comme le demande le plaignant, imposerait de strictes obligations aux parties qui compara\u00eetraient plus tard devant le Tribunal et sur-judiciariserait le processus suivi devant ce dernier. En fin de compte, cette mesure serait incompatible avec la souplesse que doivent comporter les proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal et elle cr\u00e9erait ult\u00e9rieurement des obstacles pour les plaignants non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[35] La Commission a soutenu qu\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert peut \u00eatre utile au juge des faits en lui fournissant des termes ou des aspects techniques ou scientifiques n\u00e9cessaires, pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 \u00e9valuer convenablement les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[36] La Commission a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux propos du juge Dickson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24, au paragraphe 42, pour laisser entendre que le r\u00f4le de l\u2019expert consiste \u00e0 fournir au juge des faits une conclusion toute faite que ce dernier, en raison de la nature technique des faits en question, est incapable de formuler.\n[37] La Commission a cit\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, au paragraphe 22, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la th\u00e8se selon laquelle la preuve d\u2019expert doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire au juge des faits, et ce, selon le cas :\n(i) pour appr\u00e9cier les faits \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 leur nature technique;\n(ii) pour former un jugement juste s\u2019il est peu probable que des personnes ordinaires puissent le faire sans l\u2019assistance de personnes poss\u00e9dant des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales.\n[38] Pour ce qui est de la pertinence, la Commission a cit\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Pascoe (1997) 32 O.R. (3d) 37 (C.A.), au paragraphe 27, pour faire valoir que m\u00eame une preuve potentiellement pertinente peut \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e si elle a plus d\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable que de valeur probante.\n[39] La Commission a ajout\u00e9 que si le rapport du Dr Belchetz r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence et a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme aux R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, il convient dans ce cas de l\u2019admettre. Elle indique, au paragraphe 11, que si le rapport du Dr Belchetz ne porte pas sur la question pr\u00e9cise dont le Tribunal est saisi et n\u2019est ni pertinent ni n\u00e9cessaire, il pr\u00e9sente tout de m\u00eame une [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9alit\u00e9 contextuelle \u00bb.\n[40] La Commission est d\u2019avis que le Tribunal ait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019exclure une preuve pertinente si sa valeur probante est trompeuse ou si le temps requis pour la pr\u00e9senter est disproportionn\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 sa valeur probante, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan.\n[41] Aux dires de la Commission, on ne peut pas accueillir la requ\u00eate du plaignant sans permettre au juge des faits de soupeser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que fourniront les t\u00e9moins, et elle cite \u00e0 cet effet la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN. Comme elle l\u2019indique : [traduction] \u00ab les R\u00e8gles ne contiennent pas de disposition portant sur l\u2019exclusion d\u2019un rapport d\u2019expert, et le Tribunal se doit de prendre garde de ne pas recourir \u00e0 une mesure extraordinaire, comme radier une large tranche de la preuve d\u2019une partie \u00bb.\n[42] La Commission fait \u00e9galement valoir que le Tribunal ne dispose que de dix articles dans ses R\u00e8gles, tandis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en a plus de cinq cents, ce qui, soutient-elle, repose sur le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi : \u00ab L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. La Commission signale que les R\u00e8gles des cours sup\u00e9rieures des provinces ne lient pas le Tribunal.\n[43] La Commission est d\u2019avis que le rapport du Dr Belchetz peut \u00e9tayer la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu\u2019il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans son EP et son EPM, et elle cite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2014 CAF 131 :\n[21] Je pense comme le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er un droit proc\u00e9dural distinct en mati\u00e8re d\u2019adaptation. La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re tient en une seule question : l\u2019employeur a\u2011t\u2011il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00ab qu\u2019il [lui] est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans [subir] une contrainte excessive \u00bb? D\u00e8s qu\u2019il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 ce fait, l\u2019employeur a rempli la condition de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape. En supposant que les conditions des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes sont aussi remplies (et elles l\u2019\u00e9taient dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce), la norme en cause peut se d\u00e9finir comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e et ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire.\nVI. Les discussions tenues lors des CTGI sur la preuve d\u2019expert et la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 l\u2019exclure\n[44] Lors de la CTGI du 9 juin 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que le plaignant ne souffrait pas d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, comme il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte, et il a laiss\u00e9 entendre que sans d\u00e9ficience il ne pouvait pas y avoir d\u2019acte discriminatoire. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait retenu les services du Dr Belchetz pour critiquer les notes et les rapports que la Dre Bautista lui avait transmis, relativement \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience diagnostiqu\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019absence de pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 l\u2019aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 travailler ou \u00e0 travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, au vu des sympt\u00f4mes d\u00e9clar\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que les questions qu\u2019il a pos\u00e9es au Dr Belchetz, de m\u00eame que les r\u00e9ponses de ce dernier, sont \u00e9galement consign\u00e9es dans son EP et son EPM.\n[45] Lors de la CTGI du 20 juillet 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que les articles 48.9 et 50 de la Loi conf\u00e8rent au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019inclure des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais non d\u2019en exclure. Il a \u00e9galement soutenu que, si le rapport du Dr Belchetz a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles, son admissibilit\u00e9 est donc automatique, et je n\u2019ai pas le pouvoir de l\u2019exclure. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant que l\u2019on \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 reconna\u00eetre le Dr Belchetz comme expert dans les limites de son opinion d\u2019expert, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme un examen du type [traduction] \u00ab examen par les pairs \u00bb et par le Dr Belchetz comme l\u2019opinion d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab expert objectif en la mati\u00e8re \u00bb.\n[46] Dans leurs observations, la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas trait\u00e9 d\u2019un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada : White Burgess. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a laiss\u00e9 entendre que les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure ne s\u2019appliquent pas au Tribunal, et qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 celui-ci.\n[47] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est montr\u00e9 r\u00e9ceptif \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de citer le Dr Belchetz \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner de vive voix \u00e0 l\u2019audience, \u00e0 titre de non-expert. Le plaignant souhaitait que l\u2019on donne suite \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 exclure la preuve du Dr Belchetz, qu\u2019il soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un expert comp\u00e9tent ou non, et il a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de prendre en compte l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess.\nVII. Le rapport et le curriculum vit\u00e6 du Dr Belchetz\n[48] Le Tribunal a pass\u00e9 en revue le rapport du Dr Belchetz, de m\u00eame que son curriculum vit\u00e6. Le rapport se compose d\u2019une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 juin 2016 qui r\u00e9pond directement \u00e0 des questions de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Dr Belchetz indique qu\u2019on lui demande [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert objectif en la mati\u00e8re, de r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui suivent sur M. Michael Christoforou et les notes cliniques r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par son m\u00e9decin, la Dre Bautista \u00bb. Les r\u00e9ponses du Dr Belchetz figurent dans l\u2019ordre, sous les questions.\n[49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu lors d\u2019une CTGI que les questions que son avocat avait pos\u00e9es au Dr Belchetz \u00e9taient des points soulev\u00e9s dans son EP et son EPM et qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention d\u2019en traiter davantage lors du contre-interrogatoire de la Dre Bautista, ainsi que dans ses observations.\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que le Dr Belchetz n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 ou \u00e9valu\u00e9 le plaignant et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas retenu ses services \u00e0 titre consultatif avant et apr\u00e8s le licenciement du plaignant.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu de plus que l\u2019objet de la preuve du Dr Belchetz est de pr\u00e9senter certains des doutes \u00e9voqu\u00e9s dans son EP et son EPM dans le cadre du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion d\u2019un sp\u00e9cialiste en m\u00e9decine.\nVIII. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives, la jurisprudence et les r\u00e8gles applicables\n[52] Le premier point dont je traiterai est l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel les d\u00e9cisions des cours sup\u00e9rieures au sujet de preuves ou de t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert ne s\u2019appliquent pas au TCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en raison de la nature administrative ou non judiciaire du Tribunal, la Loi habilite seulement ce dernier \u00e0 permettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas admissibles devant un tribunal judiciaire, et non pas \u00e0 exclure des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (\u00e0 part une communication confidentielle, express\u00e9ment interdite au paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi).\n[53] Selon une observation semblable de la Commission, le Tribunal ne devrait pas conduire sa proc\u00e9dure d\u2019une mani\u00e8re semblable \u00e0 celle d\u2019un tribunal judiciaire, car cela compliquerait trop la t\u00e2che des personnes qui se repr\u00e9sentent elles-m\u00eames. Elle a invit\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 admettre la preuve d\u2019expert et \u00e0 en d\u00e9terminer le poids apr\u00e8s l\u2019instruction, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve de mani\u00e8re pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[54] La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions suivantes de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019existence d\u2019un seuil d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 fort peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u2013 sinon nul :\n48.9 (1) L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n(2) Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant, notamment :\na) l\u2019envoi des avis aux parties;\nb) l\u2019adjonction de parties ou d\u2019intervenants \u00e0 l\u2019affaire;\nc) l\u2019assignation des t\u00e9moins;\nd) la production et la signification de documents;\ne) les enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9alables;\nf) les conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires;\ng) la pr\u00e9sentation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve;\nh) le d\u00e9lai d\u2019audition et le d\u00e9lai pour rendre les d\u00e9cisions;\ni) l\u2019adjudication des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[\u2026.]\n50. (1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n(2) Il tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie.\n(3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\na) d\u2019assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit sous la foi du serment et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019archives;\nb) de faire pr\u00eater serment;\nc) de recevoir, sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (4) et (5), des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire;\nd) de modifier les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus par les r\u00e8gles de pratique;\ne) de trancher toute question de proc\u00e9dure ou de preuve.\n(4) Il ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[55] Le paragraphe 50(2) habilite le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher toutes les questions de droit ou de fait qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire. Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a), le Tribunal peut agir au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019archives pour ce qui est d\u2019assigner un t\u00e9moin et de lui ordonner de produire les pi\u00e8ces n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 un examen complet de la plainte. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) habilite le Tribunal \u00e0 recevoir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou les autres renseignements que le membre instructeur estime indiqu\u00e9s.\n[56] Au vu des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal et des d\u00e9cisions des cours sup\u00e9rieures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que rien n\u2019\u00e9taye l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel, d\u2019une part, l\u2019article 50 permet au Tribunal d\u2019admettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et, d\u2019autre part, ce dernier n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 en exclure.\n[57] La Commission convient que les arr\u00eats Abbey et Mohan de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019appliquent au Tribunal. Elle a cit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal dans lesquelles l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration et appliqu\u00e9. L\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess d\u00e9veloppe les arr\u00eats Abbey et Mohan, et je conclus qu\u2019il s\u2019applique au Tribunal.\n[58] La v\u00e9ritable question consiste \u00e0 savoir si le Tribunal peut se prononcer sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction ou si la Loi exige que l\u2019on admette la totalit\u00e9 des preuves cens\u00e9ment pertinentes, ce qui inclut les preuves d\u2019expert, et que, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019instruction, on d\u00e9cide quel poids, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il convient de leur accorder.\n[59] La pr\u00e9sente affaire est cens\u00e9e \u00eatre instruite \u00e0 la fin du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016. La preuve d\u2019expert du Dr Belchetz a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e en juin 2016, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a obtenu le report au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine d\u2019instruction pr\u00e9vue pour le mois de juin. Le plaignant souhaite obtenir le plus t\u00f4t possible une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il puisse d\u00e9terminer la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve.\n[60] La Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher les questions de proc\u00e9dure et d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui concorde avec les principes de justice naturelle pour toutes les parties, et les d\u00e9cisions que rend le Tribunal doivent mettre en balance les droits de toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable du point de vue proc\u00e9dural.\n[61] La Loi et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale am\u00e8nent souvent le Tribunal \u00e0 autoriser l\u2019introduction continue de questions litigieuses et de requ\u00eates de la part des parties, et ce, au-del\u00e0 des dates fix\u00e9es \u00e0 cet effet, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 assouplir l\u2019application des R\u00e8gles, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que toutes les parties aient la possibilit\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elles doivent r\u00e9futer et d\u2019offrir une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te. Tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont on peut soutenir la pertinence et qui \u00e9manent de t\u00e9moins des faits, ou de personnes t\u00e9moignant sur leurs observations ou sur leur participation, sont habituellement admis, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la Loi, et surtout le paragraphe 50(1) et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a). Il est d\u2019usage de d\u00e9terminer le poids des preuves \u00e0 la conclusion de l\u2019instruction, plut\u00f4t que de limiter ou de restreindre les preuves de fait qu\u2019une partie quelconque souhaite pr\u00e9senter, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces derni\u00e8res sont cens\u00e9ment pertinentes.\n[62] Les preuves (ou les t\u00e9moignages) d\u2019expert et les preuves (ou les t\u00e9moignages) d\u2019opinion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont diff\u00e9rentes des preuves de fait, ainsi que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, 1982 CanLII 25 (CSC), [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24, \u00e0 la p. 42 :\nLe t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion\nLes t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posent quant aux faits. Le juge ou le jury tire des conclusions \u00e0 partir des faits. [traduction] \u00ab Dans le droit de la preuve, \u201copinion\u201d s\u2019entend de toute conclusion qu\u2019on tire d\u2019un fait observ\u00e9, et le droit dans ce domaine d\u00e9rive de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les t\u00e9moins doivent uniquement parler de ce qu\u2019ils ont observ\u00e9 directement \u00bb (Cross on Evidence, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 442). Lorsqu\u2019il est possible de s\u00e9parer les faits des conclusions tir\u00e9es de ces faits, le t\u00e9moin ne peut t\u00e9moigner que sur les faits. Toutefois, cela n\u2019est pas toujours possible et [traduction] \u00ab le droit fait preuve de souplesse dans ces cas limites en permettant aux t\u00e9moins d\u2019exprimer leur opinion relativement \u00e0 des questions qui n\u2019exigent pas de connaissances particuli\u00e8res, chaque fois qu\u2019il leur serait virtuellement impossible de s\u00e9parer leurs conclusions des faits sur lesquels celles-ci se fondent \u00bb (ibid.).\nQuant aux questions qui exigent des connaissances particuli\u00e8res, un expert dans le domaine peut tirer des conclusions et exprimer son avis. Le r\u00f4le d\u2019un expert est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de fournir au juge et au jury une conclusion toute faite que ces derniers, en raison de la technicit\u00e9 des faits, sont incapables de formuler. [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019opinion d\u2019un expert est recevable pour donner \u00e0 la cour des renseignements scientifiques qui, selon toute vraisemblance, d\u00e9passent l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d\u2019un juge ou d\u2019un jury. Si, \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis par la preuve, un juge ou un jury peut \u00e0 lui seul tirer ses propres conclusions, alors l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, \u00e0 la p. 83, le lord juge Lawton).\n[63] Dans certains cas, le Tribunal a report\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert au moment de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve (p. ex. la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN). Toutefois, s\u2019il est possible d\u2019\u00e9valuer les pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert et de d\u00e9terminer cette admissibilit\u00e9 en examinant le rapport, la d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre rendue avant que le t\u00e9moin expert soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ou avant d\u2019entendre sa preuve : Brooks c. P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans, 2004 TCDP 20 (\u00ab Brooks \u00bb); Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 40 (\u00ab Gaucher \u00bb); Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Ministre du Personnel du Gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, 2001 CanLII 25850 (TCDP) (\u00ab AFPC \u00bb).\n[64] Dans la d\u00e9cision AFPC, le Tribunal a pris en consid\u00e9ration des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada portant sur des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert au moment de trancher une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019autorisation de citer plus que les cinq t\u00e9moins experts qu\u2019autorise la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u20115. Voici les passages de la d\u00e9cision AFPC qui confirment que le Tribunal, malgr\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 explicite de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c), a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suivre des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure et d\u2019une cour d\u2019appel dans des instances de nature civile et p\u00e9nale, relativement aux t\u00e9moins experts :\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents : R. c. Mohan [1994] A.C.S. no 36, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9 et R. v. Morin [1991] O.J. no 2528 (Div. g\u00e9n., Cour de l\u2019Ont.). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019affaires criminelles. Dans Morin, le Tribunal a simplement statu\u00e9 que des motifs raisonnables doivent militer en faveur de la citation de t\u00e9moins experts. L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan traite des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9terminer si un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert est admissible, \u00e0 savoir la pertinence de ce t\u00e9moignage et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour le juge des faits de l\u2019entendre pour \u00e9tablir les faits entourant l\u2019affaire.\n[3] Alan Mewett et Peter Sankoff ont \u00e9crit que le r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du t\u00e9moin expert [traduction] \u00ab diff\u00e8re de celui du t\u00e9moin profane ordinaire en ce sens que le premier t\u00e9moigne afin d\u2019aider le juge des faits \u00e0 tirer une conclusion \u00e0 partir des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, tandis que le dernier t\u00e9moigne au sujet de ces m\u00eames faits \u00bb. Mewett et Sankoff pr\u00e9cisent que le recours \u00e0 des t\u00e9moins experts \u00ab remonte aussi loin dans l\u2019histoire que le processus judiciaire proprement dit \u00bb. Ils signalent que ce type de t\u00e9moignages a suscit\u00e9 historiquement deux pr\u00e9occupations : d\u2019une part, cela complique le processus judiciaire du fait que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00ab redondants et superflus \u00bb sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s; d\u2019autre part, on a facilement tendance \u00e0 exag\u00e9rer l\u2019importance du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert, ce qui risque de miner le r\u00f4le du juge des faits. Bien qu\u2019ils aient tergivers\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, les tribunaux \u00ab ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tent\u00e9 de faire appel \u00e0 des experts que dans les cas o\u00f9 cela \u00e9tait vraiment n\u00e9cessaire. \u00bb\n[4] L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan \u00e9nonce certains principaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pertinents. La preuve d\u2019expert a pour objet d\u2019aider un organisme ayant le pouvoir de rendre la justice \u00e0 se prononcer sur les faits entourant une affaire. Elle aide en fournissant au juge des faits les renseignements et conclusions toutes faites qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre de leur exp\u00e9rience. Il s\u2019ensuit que les experts ont un r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial dans les litiges faisant appel \u00e0 une preuve statistique ou scientifique. Il s\u2019agit dans chaque cas de se demander si le t\u00e9moignage est \u00ab n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb pour trancher les points en litige. Toutefois, le crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 est appliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on relativement souple et on ne doit pas y accorder une importance exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Au paragraphe 24, le juge Sopinka fait \u00e9galement remarquer qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s ne devrait pas devenir \u00ab un simple concours d\u2019experts, dont le juge des faits se ferait l\u2019arbitre en d\u00e9cidant quel expert accepter. \u00bb\n[\u2026]\n[6] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sembl\u00e9 adopter la position voulant que la question pertinente consiste \u00e0 se demander si le t\u00e9moignage envisag\u00e9 aurait un effet important en ce qui touche un point litigieux particulier. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec cette interpr\u00e9tation. Le tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure si un t\u00e9moin qu\u2019on veut citer est digne de foi; il ne peut que d\u00e9terminer si son t\u00e9moignage pourrait logiquement contribuer \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. Il suffit donc de pouvoir dire raisonnablement que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher une des questions de fait. Cela exclut les t\u00e9moignages qui minent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure ou qui retardent ind\u00fbment son d\u00e9roulement.\n[\u2026]\n[16] L\u2019impression de justice est importante dans notre droit et le Tribunal doit \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme l\u2019auteur de ses propres d\u00e9cisions. Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne conf\u00e8re au tribunal le pouvoir de trancher \u00ab les questions de droit et les questions de fait \u00bb dans les affaires dont il est saisi. Les membres de ce tribunal se sont vu confier ce mandat. Nous avons l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9cider des questions de droit et nous ne pouvons d\u00e9l\u00e9guer cette responsabilit\u00e9 aux t\u00e9moins experts, si savants soient-ils. Les tribunaux se sont toujours inqui\u00e9t\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert qui empi\u00e8tent sur des questions sur lesquelles le juge est plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de se prononcer.\n[17] Nous ne voulons pas emp\u00eacher les parties de d\u00e9battre toutes les questions de droit qui sont pertinentes pour rendre notre d\u00e9cision. Rien n\u2019emp\u00eache l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter un m\u00e9moire sur le droit international, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les textes de loi pertinents nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eache non plus de retenir les services d\u2019experts \u2013 peut-\u00eatre ceux des experts en question \u2013 pour fournir aux avocats l\u2019information n\u00e9cessaire. Toutefois, les questions de droit ressortissent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des avocats et du tribunal, et nous croyons fermement qu\u2019elles devraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la pr\u00e9sentation des arguments plut\u00f4t que dans le cadre de la preuve d\u2019expert ou d\u2019opinion. Nous laissons \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le soin de d\u00e9cider qui nous exposera ces arguments.\n[\u2026]\n[20] Nous admettons que M. Weiler a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert dans AFPC c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il a besoin de son t\u00e9moignage pour r\u00e9pliquer \u00e0 la plainte dont nous sommes saisis. Il sera \u00e9vident que nous ne jugeons pas opportun de recueillir son opinion au sujet du droit. \u00c0 notre avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a donc pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Weiler aiderait le tribunal \u00e0 se prononcer sur les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[65] Les t\u00e9moins experts ne devraient aider le Tribunal qu\u2019\u00e0 tirer des inf\u00e9rences sur des faits techniques qui d\u00e9passent ses connaissances, et ils ne devraient pas fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion sur des questions de droit qui rel\u00e8vent du mandat et de l\u2019expertise du Tribunal. Ce dernier examinera si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le but d\u2019usurper le r\u00f4le qu\u2019a le Tribunal de se prononcer sur la \u00ab question fondamentale \u00bb qui est soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire : Brooks, au paragraphe 13, et Gaucher, au paragraphe 12.\n[66] Dans la d\u00e9cision Keith c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2015 TCDP 4 (\u00ab Keith \u00bb), le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 sur une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 exclure un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert et il a signal\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi, les arr\u00eats Mohan et Abbey s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 lui :\n[21] Cette requ\u00eate, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, vise \u00e0 retirer \u00e0 David Jacobs la qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert relativement au dossier du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la preuve d\u2019expert devrait uniquement \u00eatre admise si la question en cause n\u00e9cessite une expertise sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre les accises factuelles, en vue de lui permettre de tirer une conclusion appropri\u00e9e.\n[22] Selon le plaignant, le rapport de M. Jacobs (le rapport) est n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du Coll\u00e8ge royal est une EPJ pour le poste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature; de plus, le rapport porte sur un objet technique, qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de l\u2019expertise ou des connaissances du Tribunal.\n[23] Selon les documents contenus dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant, le rapport fournit des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9glementation des activit\u00e9s des m\u00e9decins par l\u2019OMCO, son r\u00f4le, ses pouvoirs, et son devoir envers le public. Il traite de la question de la reconnaissance des sp\u00e9cialistes par l\u2019OMCO et de la mani\u00e8re dont cette reconnaissance est li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation par le CRMCC.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend, \u00e0 la page 2 de son dossier de requ\u00eate, que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion [traduction] \u00ab consiste principalement en un expos\u00e9 du cadre l\u00e9gal et r\u00e9glementaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation de la m\u00e9decine \u00bb et que le rapport est [traduction] \u00ab analogue \u00e0 une preuve d\u2019expert sur des questions de droit interne \u00bb, ce qui [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019est pas \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du TCDP \u00bb.\n[25] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, accorde au Tribunal davantage de latitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019admission d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que celle accord\u00e9e aux tribunaux judiciaires. N\u00e9anmoins, les deux parties ont renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe R. c. Mohan [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, lequel \u00e9nonce, au paragraphe 17, que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert varie selon l\u2019application des facteurs suivants : a) la pertinence; b) la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits; c) l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion; d) la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert. L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24, \u00e0 titre d\u2019illustration du crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9.\n[26] Je crois que le Tribunal devrait suivre l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation retenue par le juge Dickson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, selon lequel le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au juge des faits d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019objet du litige en raison de sa nature technique. Pour que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert soit admissible, le litige doit \u00eatre tel \u00ab qu\u2019il est peu probable que des personnes ordinaires puissent former un jugement juste \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sans l\u2019assistance de personnes poss\u00e9dant des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales \u00bb (voir Beven on Negligence (4e \u00e9d. 1928), cit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan et dans la d\u00e9cision Rosin c. Canadian Armed Forces, 1989 CanLII 149 (TCDP), conf. par [1991] 1 C.F. 391 (C.A.)). \u00ab [L]a \u201csimple utilit\u00e9\u201d est un seuil trop bas pour justifier l\u2019acceptation des dangers inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019admission de la preuve d\u2019expert \u00bb (voir R. c. D.D. 2000 CSC, au paragraphe 47, renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohanet, \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 TCDP 46, au paragraphe 8).\n[27] Le plaignant a laiss\u00e9 entendre que le domaine d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de connaissance du Tribunal \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il visait sp\u00e9cifiquement l\u2019examen de la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu de la discrimination et l\u2019octroi du redressement appropri\u00e9. Il cite la d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 40, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette affirmation. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le plaignant, le rapport du Dr Jacobs ne rel\u00e8ve pas de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et des connaissances techniques du Tribunal.\n[28] Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que le membre instructeur \u00ab tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie \u00bb. Je crois que le meilleur \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la conclusion du Tribunal en ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de recevoir en preuve le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert quant au droit se trouve dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 26, aux paragraphes 16 et 17. Le Tribunal a pour mandat de trancher des questions de fait et de droit, et il ne devrait pas d\u00e9l\u00e9guer cette responsabilit\u00e9 aux t\u00e9moins experts : \u00ab les questions de droit ressortissent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des avocats et du tribunal [...] elles devraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la pr\u00e9sentation des arguments plut\u00f4t que dans le cadre de la preuve d\u2019expert ou d\u2019opinion \u00bb.\n[29] Je souscris \u00e0 la qualification du rapport par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon laquelle celui\u2011ci consiste principalement en une r\u00e9citation des cadres l\u00e9gaux et r\u00e9glementaires. Je crois que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait. Le rapport du Dr Jacobs rel\u00e8ve de la connaissance et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du Tribunal, et les questions de droit qui y sont abord\u00e9es ne devraient pas \u00eatre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin expert, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[30] Pour les motifs ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019ORDONNE que le rapport du Dr Jacobs ne soit pas admis en preuve.\n[67] Dans la d\u00e9cision Croteau c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2014 TCDP 16 (\u00ab Croteau \u00bb), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019un expert \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une preuve d\u2019expert. Les passages pertinents de cette d\u00e9cision sont les suivants :\n[67] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que M. AB soit reconnu comme qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une preuve d\u2019expert sur les aspects suivants : [traduction] \u00ab trouble de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9; TSPT; trouble d\u2019adaptation; crises de panique et effets de ces derni\u00e8res sur des individus et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Croteau; causes de ces troubles; capacit\u00e9 des personnes souffrant d\u2019un TSPT \u00e0 revenir au travail de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Croteau; les mesures \u00e0 prendre pour que le plaignant puisse retourner au travail; [et] commentaires sur les EMI du Dr Chad. \u00bb\n[68] L\u2019avocat du CN s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que M. AB soit qualifi\u00e9 comme expert. Il ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que ce dernier t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 titre de psychologue soignant du plaignant, mais il a fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait [traduction] \u00ab h\u00e9siter \u00e0 se fier aux choses qu\u2019il a dites \u00bb. Les motifs du CN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont les suivants :\n[traduction]\n(1) le diagnostic que M. [AB] a pos\u00e9 au sujet de M. Croteau est, de son propre aveu, en contradiction avec les exigences du DSM\u2011IV et avec l\u2019opinion pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante dans la profession de la psychiatrie\/psychologie (du moins en ce qui concerne le trouble de stress post-traumatique);\n(2) la relation professionnelle qu\u2019il entretient avec M. Croteau a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les bornes et s\u2019est mu\u00e9e en un r\u00f4le de d\u00e9fense sans r\u00e9serve en faveur de M. Croteau, et il n\u2019a pas l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 que les arbitres exigent des sp\u00e9cialistes en m\u00e9decine;\n(3) dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. [AB] a refus\u00e9 de changer d\u2019avis ou d\u2019opinion, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre rendu compte que les faits sur lesquels reposait au d\u00e9part son opinion \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents de ce qu\u2019il avait compris.\n[69] Compte tenu des deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me arguments qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je refuse de reconna\u00eetre que M. AB est qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une preuve d\u2019expert sur les questions demand\u00e9es. Cependant, je prendrai en consid\u00e9ration son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 titre de psychologue soignant de M. Croteau, et je lui accorderai le poids qui convient.\n[70] Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue l\u2019arr\u00eat cl\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui porte sur la nature et la recevabilit\u00e9 des preuves d\u2019expert : R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9 \u2013 de m\u00eame que les quatre crit\u00e8res qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. D\u00e9tail int\u00e9ressant, les crit\u00e8res n\u2019incluent pas une exigence distincte d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et d\u2019impartialit\u00e9. Cependant, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019inf\u00e8rent les tribunaux canadiens : voir, par exemple, R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, au paragraphe 87, note de bas de page no 8, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel rejet\u00e9e par [2010] C.S.C.R. no 125; ainsi qu\u2019Es-Sayyid c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2012 CAF 59, au paragraphe 43, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel rejet\u00e9e par [2012] C.S.C.R. no 116.\n[68] Un examen des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal Brooks, Gaucher, AFPC, Keith et Croteau, dans lesquelles sont appliqu\u00e9s les arr\u00eats Abbey et Mohan, confirme que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi, les principes qui suivent s\u2019appliquent aux preuves ou aux t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert qui rel\u00e8vent du TCDP :\nl\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess s\u2019applique au Tribunal, parce qu\u2019il d\u00e9veloppe deux arr\u00eats ant\u00e9rieurs de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada : Abbey et Mohan;\nle Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer si le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert est n\u00e9cessaire, du fait de la nature technique ou scientifique des faits, pour que le Tribunal tire l\u2019inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9cessaire au sujet des faits ou rende la conclusion juridique requise. Si la preuve factuelle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e est suffisante pour que le Tribunal tire ses propres inf\u00e9rences et conclusions, sans le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert, ce t\u00e9moignage est alors inutile;\nle Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019autoriser tous les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties et de se prononcer ensuite sur leur poids et leur acceptation. Si une simple lecture du rapport r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les questions et les pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont \u00e9videntes, il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019on peut \u00e9valuer les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sans entendre le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert propos\u00e9;\nle Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert propos\u00e9 r\u00e9pond aux conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les arr\u00eats Mohan et White Burgess;\nle Tribunal doit \u00e9galement prendre en compte l\u2019analyse co\u00fbts-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices du fait de savoir si le fait d\u2019autoriser le t\u00e9moignage l\u2019emporte sur un risque quelconque de porter pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction, et ce, en soupesant les questions suivantes : 1) un manque d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019autre partie, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, cette partie est-elle en mesure de contre-interroger l\u2019expert ou d\u2019introduire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui traitent du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert de la partie adverse?; 2) le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert a-t-il pour objet d\u2019usurper la fonction de l\u2019arbitre, laquelle consiste \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, \u00e0 constater les faits et \u00e0 trancher les questions de nature factuelle et juridique; 3) le t\u00e9moignage prolongera-t-il l\u2019instruction, occasionnera-t-il des d\u00e9lais et fera-t-il augmenter les frais juridiques et d\u2019autres co\u00fbts?\n[69] J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue plusieurs d\u00e9cisions rendues par des cours sup\u00e9rieures apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess pour comprendre la mani\u00e8re dont elles interpr\u00e8tent et appliquent cet arr\u00eat. Je rel\u00e8ve ci-apr\u00e8s plusieurs d\u00e9cisions instructives.\n[70] L\u2019arr\u00eat Kon Construction Ltd. c. Terranova Developments Ltd., 2015 ABCA 249 (CanLII) (\u00ab Kon Construction \u00bb) illustre la mani\u00e8re d\u2019appliquer l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, aux paragraphes 21, 30 et 35 \u00e0 38 :\n[traduction]\n[21] Il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion est inadmissible [selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) et le paragraphe (4) de la Loi, il n\u2019existe aucune preuve cens\u00e9ment inadmissible, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des \u00e9l\u00e9ments confidentiels, devant le TCDP], sous r\u00e9serve de quelques exceptions. La plus importante de ces derni\u00e8res est le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert sur des questions qui requi\u00e8rent des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es : White Burgess Langille Inman c Abbott and Haliburton Co. [2015] 2 R.C.S. 182, aux par. 14-15, 470 NR 324. Dans le cas d\u2019une opinion fond\u00e9e sur une science nouvelle ou contest\u00e9e ou sur une science utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins nouvelles, il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer la fiabilit\u00e9 des principes scientifiques qui \u00e9tayent la preuve : White Burgess, au par. 23. \u00c0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9ventail, il y a les \u00ab opinions \u00bb, qui ne sont qu\u2019une simple compilation d\u2019observations ordinaires, et elles sont admissibles m\u00eame si elles sont formul\u00e9es par un t\u00e9moin profane : Graat c La Reine, 1982 CanLII 33 (CSC), [1982] 2 R.C.S. 819. Le droit de la preuve proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une analyse co\u00fbts-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices globale du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion en le comparant au pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moignage pour le proc\u00e8s : White Burgess, au par. 24.\n[\u2026]\nLes t\u00e9moins experts\n[30] Lorsqu\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9, les R\u00e8gles de la Cour exigent que les parties en donnent avis \u00e0 leurs adversaires. Quand le t\u00e9moin est appel\u00e9, le juge du proc\u00e8s entend les observations et applique le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (CSC), [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9 en vue de d\u00e9terminer si ce t\u00e9moin est qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert. Le t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le juge des faits. Celui-ci doit \u00e9galement d\u00e9cider si le t\u00e9moin poss\u00e8de bel et bien les connaissances sp\u00e9ciales requises. Une fois reconnu comme tel, le t\u00e9moin expert est alors autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion.\n[\u2026]\n[35] Il semble donc y avoir au moins trois cat\u00e9gories de \u00ab t\u00e9moins experts \u00bb qui, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, sont des t\u00e9moins des faits et, \u00e0 d\u2019autres, des t\u00e9moins d\u2019opinion :\na) les experts ind\u00e9pendants dont on retient les services pour faire part d\u2019une opinion sur des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le litige mais qui, par ailleurs, n\u2019ont pas pris part aux faits sous-jacents. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la cat\u00e9gorie de t\u00e9moin expert qui est envisag\u00e9e par les arr\u00eats White Burgess et Mohan;\nb) les t\u00e9moins experts qui ont pris part aux faits sous-jacents au litige mais qui ne sont pas eux-m\u00eames parties. Un exemple est celui du m\u00e9decin de famille dans une affaire de l\u00e9sion corporelle qui est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur ce qu\u2019il a observ\u00e9 chez le plaignant, ainsi que sur le traitement dispens\u00e9;\nc) les parties (y compris les cadres et les employ\u00e9s de parties qui sont des personnes morales) qui jouissent d\u2019une certaine expertise et qui ont concr\u00e8tement pris part aux faits sous-jacents au litige. C\u2019est dans cette cat\u00e9gorie que se rangent Marinus Scheffer et Klaver.\nLes r\u00e8gles de preuve et de proc\u00e9dure civile qui se rapportent aux t\u00e9moins experts sont principalement con\u00e7ues pour traiter de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie de t\u00e9moin expert\n[36] La premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019\u00ab experts ind\u00e9pendants \u00bb doit toujours \u00eatre reconnue par le juge du proc\u00e8s selon la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, et il est n\u00e9cessaire, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les R\u00e8gles de la Cour, de donner pr\u00e9alablement avis de leurs opinions. Les t\u00e9moins experts externes \u00e0 qui l\u2019on ne reconna\u00eet pas cette qualit\u00e9 ne sont pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion qui requiert une expertise sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e. Ils sont cens\u00e9s faire preuve d\u2019un niveau minimum d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et d\u2019objectivit\u00e9.\n[37] D\u2019aucuns soutiennent parfois que les t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins de la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie ne sont pas des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019\u00ab opinion \u00bb : Westerhoff, aux par. 60-61. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point, ces personnes t\u00e9moignent sur ce qu\u2019elles ont observ\u00e9, et sur ce qu\u2019elles ont fait concr\u00e8tement. En ce sens, il ne s\u2019agit pas de t\u00e9moins d\u2019opinion. En revanche, il est difficile pour ces t\u00e9moins d\u2019expliquer pourquoi ils ont agi comme ils l\u2019ont fait sans mettre en cause leur expertise professionnelle. Ainsi, un m\u00e9decin de famille ne peut pas expliquer pourquoi il a souscrit \u00e0 un traitement particulier sans exprimer sur ce dernier une opinion m\u00e9dicale. Il est difficile de fixer la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre ce qu\u2019ils ont fait et leurs opinions d\u2019expert sur ce qu\u2019il aurait fallu faire. Lorsque des t\u00e9moins experts (qui ne sont pas parties \u00e0 une instance) doivent t\u00e9moigner sur des faits qui rel\u00e8vent de leur expertise, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prudent de les reconna\u00eetre officiellement comme tels, surtout s\u2019ils proposent d\u2019exprimer des opinions sur des questions connexes, telles que les perspectives d\u2019emploi d\u2019un patient. De plus, l\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la communication compl\u00e8te dont il est question aux alin\u00e9as 5.1(1)c) et d) des R\u00e8gles appuie la communication, avant le proc\u00e8s, des opinions des experts participants.\n[38] La derni\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie des t\u00e9moins-parties experts ne correspond pas parfaitement \u00e0 l\u2019analyse faite dans les arr\u00eats White Burgess et Mohan. Tout d\u2019abord, il est inutile de prouver que ces t\u00e9moins sont impartiaux et ind\u00e9pendants, comme il est dit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess. On n\u2019exclut plus de parties comme t\u00e9moins \u00e0 cause de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9vident dans l\u2019affaire.\n[71] Dans la d\u00e9cision Allard c. Canada, 2016 CF 236 (CanLII) (\u00ab Allard \u00bb), aux paragraphes 102 et 103, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a trait\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9volution des arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada sur les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert, le dernier \u00e9tant White Burgess :\n[102] Il est important de d\u00e9terminer la norme applicable \u00e0 l\u2019admission de t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert.\n[traduction]\n50 Les tribunaux doivent prendre soin d\u2019\u00e9carter ces t\u00e9moignages inadmissibles. Il est bien reconnu en droit que les t\u00e9moins experts ne devraient pas formuler des opinions sur des sujets \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels ils ne poss\u00e8dent aucune comp\u00e9tence, connaissance ou formation particuli\u00e8res, ni sur des sujets courants qui n\u2019exigent aucune comp\u00e9tence, connaissance ou formation particuli\u00e8res.\n(Johnson c Milton (Town), 2008 ONCA 440)\n[103] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe R c Mohan, [1994] 2 RCS 9 [Mohan], la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res applicables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019admission des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts qui avancent une nouvelle th\u00e9orie scientifique. Bien que les experts dans le pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s n\u2019aient pas avanc\u00e9 une nouvelle th\u00e9orie scientifique et que leurs comp\u00e9tences n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es durant le proc\u00e8s, il demeure n\u00e9anmoins n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer leur valeur probante, et, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, les tribunaux ont donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation.\n[72] Dans la d\u00e9cision Anderson c. Pieters, 2016 BCSC 889 (CanLII), aux paragraphes 42, 44 et 49, la Cour a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux arr\u00eats de principe concernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert et a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9volution de cet aspect jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, inclusivement :\n[traduction]\n[42] Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour a fait \u00e9tat des principes juridiques qui r\u00e9gissent l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards. Premi\u00e8rement, elle a formul\u00e9 un nouveau crit\u00e8re de base initial, qui vise \u00e0 garantir l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 d\u2019un expert. Le fait que l\u2019expert atteste dans un rapport \u00e9crit qu\u2019il est conscient de son obligation envers le tribunal, ou qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne sous serment \u00e0 cet effet, transf\u00e8re \u00e0 la partie adverse le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il est r\u00e9aliste de dire qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas admettre l\u2019opinion parce que le t\u00e9moin expert ne peut pas ou ne veut pas se conformer \u00e0 cette obligation. Si la partie adverse le fait, le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 continuera de peser sur les \u00e9paules de la partie qui propose de produire le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion. Cependant, \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire, le t\u00e9moignage ne sera \u00e9cart\u00e9 que :\n[\u2026] dans les cas manifestes o\u00f9 l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 ne peut ou ne veut fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale.\n(White Burgess, au par. 49).\n[43] Si l\u2019opinion r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce premier crit\u00e8re de base, le juge du proc\u00e8s doit dans ce cas d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de cette opinion en fonction d\u2019un cadre d\u2019analyse reformul\u00e9, dans lequel la fonction de gardien comporte deux \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re est l\u2019application des quatre crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan \u2013 la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert \u2013 et auxquels s\u2019ajoute un cinqui\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, appliqu\u00e9 dans le cas d\u2019une science nouvelle ou contest\u00e9e, soit la fiabilit\u00e9 des principes scientifiques sous-jacents.\n[44] La seconde \u00e9tape comporte l\u2019exercice de pond\u00e9ration ou l\u2019analyse co\u00fbts-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices. Le juge Cromwell a adopt\u00e9 la description du processus formul\u00e9 par le juge Doherty dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII), au par. 76 :\n[\u2026] le juge du proc\u00e8s doit d\u00e9cider si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert qui r\u00e9pond aux conditions pr\u00e9alables de son admissibilit\u00e9 est suffisamment avantageux pour le proc\u00e8s pour qu\u2019il soit justifi\u00e9 de l\u2019admettre, malgr\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert pourrait causer au proc\u00e8s.\n[45] Le juge Cromwell a d\u00e9crit comme suit l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du t\u00e9moignage :\n[\u2026] la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019absence de parti pris peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie d\u2019une \u00e9chelle mobile dans laquelle il faut d\u2019abord franchir un niveau de base pour pouvoir atteindre le seuil d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et continuer ensuite \u00e0 jouer un r\u00f4le dans la pond\u00e9ration des consid\u00e9rations concurrentes globales relatives \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 ce second stade de la fonction de gardien qu\u2019il faut traiter des pr\u00e9occupations r\u00e9siduelles concernant l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 \u2013 celles qui d\u00e9coulent du fait que le t\u00e9moin, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, ne veut pas ou ne peut pas s\u2019acquitter de son obligation (arr\u00eat White Burgess, aux par. 49 et 54).\n[49] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de la fonction de gardien comporte la prise en consid\u00e9ration de quatre facteurs \u2013 la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert \u2013 de m\u00eame qu\u2019un cinqui\u00e8me facteur appliqu\u00e9 aux opinions fond\u00e9es sur une science nouvelle ou contest\u00e9e, la fiabilit\u00e9. Un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert qui soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations suffisamment s\u00e9rieuses en lien avec l\u2019un quelconque de ces facteurs \u2013 p. ex., l\u2019opinion n\u2019est manifestement pas pertinente ou n\u2019est manifestement pas n\u00e9cessaire pour que les jur\u00e9s, faisant appel \u00e0 leur propre exp\u00e9rience, tirent du t\u00e9moignage des inf\u00e9rences appropri\u00e9es \u2013 doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9. La seconde \u00e9tape consiste ensuite \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration non seulement la totalit\u00e9 de ces facteurs, mais aussi toute autre pr\u00e9occupation relative au poids du t\u00e9moignage qui est susceptible de mettre en p\u00e9ril la capacit\u00e9 du jury de s\u2019acquitter convenablement de sa t\u00e2che, eu \u00e9gard aux co\u00fbts ou aux effets pr\u00e9judiciables possibles. Ces autres pr\u00e9occupations englobent des questions telles que la fiabilit\u00e9, les qualifications, l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et le parti pris. L\u2019analyse a pour but non pas d\u2019usurper la fonction du jury, qui consiste \u00e0 soupeser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais de l\u2019aider en veillant, dans toute la mesure du possible, \u00e0 ce que la preuve qui lui est soumise puisse \u00eatre convenablement soupes\u00e9e pendant qu\u2019il s\u2019acquitte de son obligation de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e et efficace.\n[73] De plus, je citerai quelques paragraphes tir\u00e9s de l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess qui, selon moi, sont pertinents pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente analyse :\n(2) Le cadre juridique actuel r\u00e9gissant le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion d\u2019un expert\n[16] Depuis au moins le milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990, la Cour a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 nombre de pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019incidence d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert d\u2019une valeur douteuse sur le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance. La jurisprudence a clarifi\u00e9 et resserr\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, \u00e9tabli de nouvelles exigences de fiabilit\u00e9, notamment en ce qui concerne la preuve issue de sciences nouvelles, et renforc\u00e9 l\u2019important r\u00f4le de \u00ab gardien \u00bb du juge qui consiste \u00e0 \u00e9carter d\u2019embl\u00e9e les t\u00e9moignages dont la valeur ne justifie pas la confusion, la lenteur et les frais que leur admission risque de causer. [1] Le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert peut constituer la pi\u00e8ce ma\u00eetresse dans la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 tout comme il peut pr\u00e9senter des dangers particuliers. Pour se pr\u00e9munir contre ces dangers, la Cour depuis une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es resserre graduellement les r\u00e8gles d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et renforce le r\u00f4le de gardien du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Ainsi, l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert est subordonn\u00e9e au respect de certaines normes fondamentales. [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\n[17] Nous pouvons prendre comme point de d\u00e9part de cette nouvelle tendance la d\u00e9cision de la Cour dans l\u2019affaire R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9. Cet arr\u00eat a mis en lumi\u00e8re les dangers du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert et \u00e9tabli un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 quatre volets pour en \u00e9valuer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Ces dangers sont bien connus. Il y a notamment le risque que le juge des faits s\u2019en remette inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert au lieu de l\u2019\u00e9valuer avec circonspection. [\u2026]\n[18] Il s\u2019agit de pr\u00e9server le proc\u00e8s devant juge et jury, et non pas d\u2019y substituer le proc\u00e8s instruit par des experts. Il y a un risque que le jury [traduction] \u00ab soit incapable de faire un examen critique et efficace de la preuve \u00bb (R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, 97 O.R. (3d) 330, par. 90, autorisation d\u2019appel refus\u00e9e, [2010] 2 R.C.S. v). Le juge des faits doit faire appel \u00e0 son \u00ab jugement \u00e9clair\u00e9 \u00bb plut\u00f4t que simplement trancher la question sur le fondement d\u2019un \u00ab acte de confiance \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert (J.-L.J., par. 56). Le danger de \u00ab s\u2019en remettre \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert \u00bb est \u00e9galement exacerb\u00e9 par le fait que la preuve d\u2019expert est imperm\u00e9able au contre-interrogatoire efficace par des avocats qui ne sont pas des experts dans ce domaine (D.D., par. 54). La jurisprudence aborde un certain nombre d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes connexes : le pr\u00e9judice qui pourrait \u00e9ventuellement d\u00e9couler d\u2019une opinion d\u2019expert fond\u00e9e sur des informations qui ne sont pas attest\u00e9es sous serment et qui ne peuvent pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire (D.D., par. 55); le danger d\u2019admettre en preuve de la \u00ab science de pacotille \u00bb (J.-L.J., par. 25); le risque qu\u2019un \u00ab concours d\u2019experts \u00bb ne distraie le juge des faits au lieu de l\u2019aider (Mohan, p. 24). Un autre danger bien connu associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019admission de la preuve d\u2019expert est le fait qu\u2019elle peut exiger un d\u00e9lai et des frais d\u00e9mesur\u00e9s (Mohan, p. 21; D.D., par. 56; Masterpiece Inc. c. Alavida Lifestyles Inc., 2011 CSC 27, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 387, par. 76).\n[19] Pour parer \u00e0 ces dangers, la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan a \u00e9tabli une structure de base \u00e0 deux volets d\u00e9finissant les r\u00e8gles d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion d\u2019un expert. En premier lieu, celui qui cherche \u00e0 faire admettre une preuve d\u2019opinion \u00e9manant d\u2019un expert doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle satisfait \u00e0 quatre crit\u00e8res : (1) la pertinence; (2) la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits; (3) l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion; (4) la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert (Mohan, p. 20-25; voir \u00e9galement Sekhon, par. 43). L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan insiste par ailleurs sur le r\u00f4le important du juge du proc\u00e8s pour d\u00e9terminer si une preuve d\u2019expert par ailleurs admissible devrait \u00eatre exclue parce que sa valeur probante est surpass\u00e9e par son effet pr\u00e9judiciable \u2014 un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel permettant d\u2019exclure une preuve \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une analyse co\u00fbt-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices (p. 21). Il s\u2019agit du second volet de la structure, mis en \u00e9vidence par la jurisprudence ult\u00e9rieure (Lederman, Bryant et Fuerst, p. 789-790; J.-L.J., par. 28).\n[20] L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan et la jurisprudence ult\u00e9rieure ne pr\u00e9cisent toutefois pas comment cette analyse \u00ab du co\u00fbt et des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00bb s\u2019inscrit dans l\u2019analyse globale. La Cour dans cet arr\u00eat proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019analyse co\u00fbt-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices relativement \u00e0 certains des quatre crit\u00e8res, mais elle fait aussi observer qu\u2019une telle analyse peut relever de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui permet d\u2019exclure une preuve dont la valeur probante ne justifie pas son admission, compte tenu de ses effets potentiellement pr\u00e9judiciables (p. 21). Depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, la jurisprudence s\u2019est \u00e9galement int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 des aspects particuliers du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion d\u2019un expert, mais souvent sans expliciter la place qu\u2019occupent ces autres pr\u00e9occupations dans l\u2019analyse. Cependant, la jurisprudence, dans son ensemble, tend indubitablement \u00e0 resserrer les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 renforcer le r\u00f4le de gardien du juge.\n[21] Par exemple, le crit\u00e8re de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u00e9vidence dans des d\u00e9cisions telles que D.D. La majorit\u00e9 y souligne que l\u2019exigence de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00ab vise \u00e0 ce que les dangers li\u00e9s \u00e0 la preuve d\u2019expert ne soient pas trait\u00e9s \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re \u00bb, ajoutant que \u00ab [l]a simple pertinence ou \u201cutilit\u00e9\u201d ne suffit pas \u00bb (par. 46). D\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions ont abord\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 des principes scientifiques \u00e0 la base d\u2019une opinion et, en fait, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve techniques en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (J.-L.J.; R. c. Trochym, 2007 CSC 6, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 239). Toutefois, on ne sait toujours pas o\u00f9 exactement, dans l\u2019analyse globale, s\u2019inscrivent l\u2019analyse co\u00fbt-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et les pr\u00e9occupations comme celles relatives \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9.\n[22] L\u2019arr\u00eat Abbey (ONCA) a apport\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions utiles en scindant la d\u00e9marche en deux temps. Je suis d\u2019avis de l\u2019adopter, \u00e0 peu de choses pr\u00e8s.\n[23] Dans un premier temps, celui qui veut pr\u00e9senter le t\u00e9moignage doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il satisfait aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, soit les quatre crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, \u00e0 savoir la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert. De plus, dans le cas d\u2019une opinion fond\u00e9e sur une science nouvelle ou contest\u00e9e ou sur une science utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins nouvelles, la fiabilit\u00e9 des principes scientifiques \u00e9tayant la preuve doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e (J.-L.J., par. 33, 35-36 et 47;Trochym, par. 27; Lederman, Bryant et Fuerst, p. 788-789 et 800-801). Le crit\u00e8re de la pertinence, \u00e0 ce stade, s\u2019entend de la pertinence logique (Abbey (ONCA), par. 82; J.-L.J., par. 47). Tout t\u00e9moignage qui ne satisfait pas \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res devrait \u00eatre exclu. Il est \u00e0 noter qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 demeure un crit\u00e8re (D.D., par. 57; voir D. M. Paciocco et L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (7e \u00e9d. 2015), p. 209-210; R. c. Boswell, 2011 ONCA 283, 85 C.R. (6th) 290, par. 13; R. c. C. (M.), 2014 ONCA 611, 13 C.R. (7th) 396, par. 72).\n[24] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, le juge-gardien exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en soupesant les risques et les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels que pr\u00e9sente l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moignage, afin de d\u00e9cider si les premiers sont justifi\u00e9s par les seconds. Cet exercice n\u00e9cessaire de pond\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, le juge Sopinka parle du \u00ab facteur fiabilit\u00e9-effet \u00bb (p. 21), tandis que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.-L.J., le juge Binnie renvoie \u00e0 \u00ab la pertinence, la fiabilit\u00e9 et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 par rapport au d\u00e9lai, au pr\u00e9judice, \u00e0 la confusion qui peuvent r\u00e9sulter \u00bb (par. 47). Le juge Doherty r\u00e9sume bien la question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Abbey, lorsqu\u2019il explique que [traduction] \u00ab le juge du proc\u00e8s doit d\u00e9cider si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert qui satisfait aux conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 est assez avantageux pour le proc\u00e8s pour justifier son admission malgr\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice potentiel, pour le proc\u00e8s, qui peut d\u00e9couler de son admission \u00bb (par. 76).\n[25] Le cadre analytique ainsi d\u00e9limit\u00e9, penchons-nous sur la nature de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert envers le tribunal et voyons comment elle s\u2019inscrit dans ce cadre.\n[\u2026]\n[32] Trois concepts apparent\u00e9s sont \u00e0 la base des diverses d\u00e9finitions de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019impartialit\u00e9, l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019absence de parti pris. L\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert doit \u00eatre impartiale, en ce sens qu\u2019elle d\u00e9coule d\u2019un examen objectif des questions \u00e0 trancher. Elle doit \u00eatre ind\u00e9pendante, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre le fruit du jugement ind\u00e9pendant de l\u2019expert, non influenc\u00e9e par la partie pour qui il t\u00e9moigne ou l\u2019issue du litige. Elle doit \u00eatre exempte de parti pris, en ce sens qu\u2019elle ne doit pas favoriser injustement la position d\u2019une partie au d\u00e9triment de celle de l\u2019autre. Le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9cisif est que l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert ne changerait pas, peu importe la partie qui aurait retenu ses services (P. Michell et R. Mandhane, \u00ab The Uncertain Duty of the Expert Witness \u00bb (2005), 42 Alta. L. Rev. 635, p. 638-639). Ces concepts, il va sans dire, doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s du d\u00e9bat contradictoire. Les experts sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement engag\u00e9s, mandat\u00e9s et pay\u00e9s par l\u2019un des adversaires. Ces faits, \u00e0 eux seuls, ne compromettent pas l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance, l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 ni l\u2019absence de parti pris de l\u2019expert.\n[\u2026]\n[34] Dans la pr\u00e9sente section, j\u2019explique pourquoi je r\u00e9ponds par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 ces deux questions : l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 de l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 jouent au regard de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage plut\u00f4t que simplement de la valeur probante de celui-ci, et l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert constitue un crit\u00e8re d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Une fois qu\u2019il est satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re, toute r\u00e9serve qui demeure quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019expert s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse co\u00fbt-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu\u2019effectue le juge dans l\u2019exercice de son r\u00f4le de gardien.\n[\u2026]\n[45] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui me semble le courant pr\u00e9dominant dans la jurisprudence canadienne, je suis d\u2019avis que le manque d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 d\u2019un expert joue au regard tant de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage que de la valeur du t\u00e9moignage, s\u2019il est admis. Cette fa\u00e7on de voir semble s\u2019accorder davantage avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de notre droit en ce qui concerne les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts et l\u2019importance que notre jurisprudence accorde au r\u00f4le de gardien exerc\u00e9 par les juges de premi\u00e8re instance. Le juge Binnie cerne bien l\u2019optique canadienne dans l\u2019arr\u00eat J.-L.J. : \u00ab La question de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e minutieusement au moment o\u00f9 elle est soulev\u00e9e, et cette preuve ne devrait pas \u00eatre admise trop facilement pour le motif que toutes ses faiblesses peuvent en fin de compte avoir une incidence sur son poids plut\u00f4t que sur son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 28).\n[\u2026]\n[49] Ce crit\u00e8re n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement exigeant, et il sera probablement tr\u00e8s rare que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 soit jug\u00e9 inadmissible au motif qu\u2019il ne satisfait pas au crit\u00e8re. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance doit d\u00e9terminer, compte tenu tant de la situation particuli\u00e8re de l\u2019expert que de la teneur du t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9, si l\u2019expert peut ou veut s\u2019acquitter de sa principale obligation envers le tribunal. Par exemple, c\u2019est la nature et le degr\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou des rapports qu\u2019a l\u2019expert avec l\u2019instance ou une partie qui importent, et non leur simple existence : un int\u00e9r\u00eat ou un rapport quelconque ne rend pas d\u2019embl\u00e9e la preuve de l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 inadmissible. Dans la plupart des cas, l\u2019existence d\u2019une simple relation d\u2019emploi entre l\u2019expert et la partie qui le cite n\u2019emporte pas l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve. En revanche, un int\u00e9r\u00eat financier direct dans l\u2019issue du litige suscite des pr\u00e9occupations. Il en va ainsi des liens familiaux \u00e9troits avec une partie et des situations o\u00f9 l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 s\u2019expose \u00e0 une responsabilit\u00e9 professionnelle si le tribunal ne retient pas son opinion. De m\u00eame, l\u2019expert qui, dans sa d\u00e9position ou d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re, se fait le d\u00e9fenseur d\u2019une partie ne peut ou ne veut manifestement pas s\u2019acquitter de sa principale obligation envers le tribunal. Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019exclure le t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse pour non-conformit\u00e9 aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ne devrait \u00eatre prise que dans les cas manifestes o\u00f9 l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 ne peut ou ne veut fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale. Dans les autres cas, le t\u00e9moignage ne devrait pas \u00eatre exclu d\u2019office, et son admissibilit\u00e9 sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une pond\u00e9ration globale du co\u00fbt et des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de son admission.\n[\u2026]\n(2) Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du juge en tant que \u00ab gardien \u00bb\n[54] La constatation que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert satisfait aux crit\u00e8res ne met pas fin \u00e0 l\u2019analyse. Conform\u00e9ment au cadre \u00e9tabli dans la foul\u00e9e de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan dont nous avons discut\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le juge doit encore tenir compte des r\u00e9serves \u00e9mises quant \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et \u00e0 l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 de l\u2019expert lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9value la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape o\u00f9 il exerce son r\u00f4le de gardien. Il peut \u00eatre utile de concevoir la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019absence de parti pris comme autant d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019un examen en deux temps, qui entrent en ligne de compte \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, celle qui sert \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est satisfait aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, et jouent \u00e9galement un r\u00f4le \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me, dans la pond\u00e9ration des consid\u00e9rations concurrentes globales relatives \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Au bout du compte, le juge doit \u00eatre convaincu que les risques li\u00e9s au t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert ne l\u2019emportent pas sur l\u2019utilit\u00e9 possible de celui-ci.\nIX. L\u2019analyse\n[74] Je confirme que l\u2019analyse expos\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess s\u2019applique au Tribunal dans le contexte de la Loi. Des arbitres ant\u00e9rieurs du Tribunal ont mis en balance les arr\u00eats Mohan et Abbey et la Loi, et je suis \u00e9clair\u00e9e et guid\u00e9e par ces d\u00e9cisions dans la pr\u00e9sente analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess. Je suis tenue par la Loi d\u2019analyser en d\u00e9tail le rapport du Dr Belchetz et les titres de comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans son curriculum vit\u00e6, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, en vue de d\u00e9terminer si le Dr Belchetz devrait fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert, voire un t\u00e9moignage quelconque \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\nA. L\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9\n[75] Le Dr Belchetz a sign\u00e9 un formulaire d\u2019attestation de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert, reconnaissant ainsi qu\u2019il est tenu de fournir un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion \u00e9quitable, objectif et impartial et un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion qui ne porte que sur des questions relevant de son domaine de comp\u00e9tence. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment de la signature de cette attestation, le rapport du Dr Belchetz n\u2019est ni ind\u00e9pendant ni impartial.\n[76] Le Dr Belchetz est un m\u00e9decin dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 a retenu les services pour les seuls besoins de la pr\u00e9sente instruction, ce qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 35 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Kon Construction, est le type de t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert auquel s\u2019applique l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le risque de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019instance est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans le cas des [traduction] \u00ab experts en mati\u00e8re de litige \u00bb.\n[77] Le Dr Belchetz reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant ou la Dre Bautista, pas plus qu\u2019il ne leur a parl\u00e9. Les commentaires qu\u2019il fait dans sa lettre du 21 juin 2016 r\u00e9pondent directement \u00e0 des questions suggestives et pointues qui, le reconna\u00eet l\u2019intim\u00e9, font \u00e9tat des m\u00eames critiques \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la Dre Bautista que celles qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans son EP et son EPM. Le Dr Belchetz souscrit aux questions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur les lacunes relev\u00e9es dans la norme de soins, le processus diagnostique, les notes, le rapport et la tenue de dossiers de la Dre Bautista.\n[78] Le Dr Belchetz ne fournit aucune observation ou opinion spontan\u00e9e et ind\u00e9pendante. Son t\u00e9moignage ne semble pas \u00eatre \u00ab [\u2026] le fruit du jugement ind\u00e9pendant de l\u2019expert, non influenc[\u00e9] par la partie pour qui il t\u00e9moigne [\u2026] \u00bb. L\u2019accord qu\u2019exprime le Dr Belchetz \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des critiques que formule l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la Dre Bautista semble int\u00e9ress\u00e9 et d\u00e9fend la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nB. La pertinence et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits\n[79] L\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission soutiennent que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion du Dr Belchetz peut \u00eatre pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9ponde enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la plainte et pr\u00e9sente une explication ou une justification quelconque au sujet de ses pratiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n[80] Je prendrai en consid\u00e9ration le rapport du Dr Belchetz ainsi que la l\u00e9gislation et la jurisprudence applicables pour d\u00e9terminer si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion du Dr Belchetz est cens\u00e9ment pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre question et s\u2019il peut aider \u00e0 avancer la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sans usurper le r\u00f4le d\u2019arbitre que je joue en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[81] La plainte dont il est ici question est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu des articles 3, 7 et 10 de la Loi :\n3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[\u2026]\n3.1 Il est entendu que les actes discriminatoires comprennent les actes fond\u00e9s sur un ou plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite ou l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de plusieurs motifs.\n[\u2026]\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[\u2026]\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[82] Le terme \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb est d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi :\nd\u00e9ficience D\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l\u2019alcool ou la drogue.\n[83] Dans son EP et son EPM, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience du type \u00ab stress \u00bb du plaignant, ce qui sous-entend qu\u2019il ne pensait pas que la Dre Bautista avait diagnostiqu\u00e9 convenablement ou enti\u00e8rement le plaignant et que celui-ci ne souffrait peut-\u00eatre pas d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience l\u00e9gitime. Lors des CTGI, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que le plaignant souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi, et il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas pu se livrer \u00e0 des pratiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qui constituaient un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[84] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, et cela inclut le fait de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant souffre d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[85] Dans la d\u00e9cision Audet c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 25, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi d\u00e9signe \u00ab tout handicap physique ou mental qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d\u2019un handicap \u00bb. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019employeur a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie dont souffrait M. Audet, ainsi que les crises qui en d\u00e9coulaient, l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de fonctionner dans un poste critique sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que son \u00e9tat \u00e9tait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[86] L\u2019arr\u00eat Desormeaux c. Commission de transport d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton, 2005 CarswellNat 2005 CAF 311, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel refus\u00e9e par 2006 CarswellNat 621, 2006 CarswellNat 620 (C.S.C.), avait trait \u00e0 un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, qui avait annul\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision par laquelle le Tribunal avait confirm\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination pour cause de d\u00e9ficience. La plainte avait pris naissance apr\u00e8s qu\u2019OC Transpo avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Desormeaux pour absent\u00e9isme innocent d\u00fb \u00e0 ses migraines. Le Tribunal avait conclu que les maux de t\u00eate de Mme Desormeaux constituaient une d\u00e9ficience pour les besoins de la Loi et, au stade du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait statu\u00e9 que la conclusion du Tribunal sur la d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[87] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli l\u2019appel et a fait remarquer que le Tribunal avait droit \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable, compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux maux de t\u00eate de la plaignante qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis; elle a conclu que le Tribunal aurait pu conclure raisonnablement qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience en raison des maux de t\u00eate, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de migraines, de c\u00e9phal\u00e9es de tension ou de quelque autre genre de dysfonctionnement de cette nature.\n[88] Dans la d\u00e9cision Dupuis c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 511, la Cour a confirm\u00e9 que la maladie mentale, qui peut rev\u00eatir des formes diverses et variables, ou la perception que l\u2019employeur en a, est une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi. Elle a fait remarquer qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 peut ne pas \u00eatre conscient qu\u2019il souffre d\u2019une maladie mentale, de sorte qu\u2019il est possible que cet employ\u00e9 ne consulte jamais un m\u00e9decin ou n\u2019avise jamais l\u2019employeur qu\u2019il a besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si un gestionnaire est en mesure de d\u00e9celer un changement de comportement qui peut \u00eatre attribuable \u00e0 un trouble d\u2019ordre mental, il lui incombe de d\u00e9terminer si des mesures d\u2019accommodement sont n\u00e9cessaires.\n[89] Dans la d\u00e9cision Desrosiers c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2003 TCDP 26, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les maux de dos du plaignant \u00e9taient une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 34 :\n[\u2026] [U]ne d\u00e9ficience peut r\u00e9sulter aussi bien d\u2019une limitation physique que d\u2019une perception de limitation ou d\u2019une combinaison des deux. [Voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J. c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, par. 79.] Le tribunal doit donc dans sa d\u00e9termination de la question \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il existe ou non une d\u00e9ficience tenir compte non seulement de la situation m\u00e9dicale du plaignant mais aussi des circonstances dans lesquelles une distinction est faite. En d\u2019autres mots, dans le cadre de l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 un employeur, le tribunal doit se demander, entre autres, si une affectation r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue engendre pour le plaignant la perte ou la diminution des possibilit\u00e9s de participer \u00e0 la vie collective au m\u00eame titre que les autres. [\u2026]\n[90] Au vu des d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es, la question de savoir si le plaignant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ou si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a per\u00e7u qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi, est une conclusion de fait que le Tribunal doit tirer en se fondant sur les t\u00e9moins qui fournissent des preuves sur les limites du plaignant, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ainsi que sur la perception qu\u2019a l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ces limites, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[91] La question de savoir si le plaignant souffre d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience requiert une analyse juridique qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Ce dernier ne d\u00e9l\u00e8guera pas la d\u00e9termination de la d\u00e9ficience aux t\u00e9moins. Conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9cisions que le Tribunal a rendues dans les affaires Brooks, Gaucher et AFPC, les preuves qui visent \u00e0 usurper la fonction de recherche de faits et d\u2019analyse juridique du Tribunal sont inadmissibles.\n[92] Si le plaignant \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est peut-\u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir que ses pratiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e et n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas discriminatoires au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi :\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[\u2026]\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[93] La Commission a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la question de savoir si le plaignant pouvait travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est pertinente pour la d\u00e9fense d\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e qu\u2019invoque l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[94] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que le Dr Belchetz n\u2019a jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le consultatif dans le cadre des faits qui ont men\u00e9 au licenciement du plaignant. Il n\u2019y a aucune pertinence \u00e9vidente du rapport du Dr Belchetz vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019article 15, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune pertinence vis-\u00e0-vis de cet article dans son EP, son EPM ou ses observations.\n[95] Selon l\u2019EP et l\u2019EPM de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ainsi que le rapport du Dr Belchetz, l\u2019intim\u00e9 produira des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou contre-interrogera la Dre Bautista au sujet de son diagnostic de l\u2019\u00e9tat du plaignant et le fondement de sa demande d\u2019effectuer un nombre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 d\u2019heures de travail. Avant 2010, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un plafond de 45 heures par semaine et, en 2010, d\u2019une plage de 40 \u00e0 42 heures.\n[96] Dans son EP et son EPM, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le manque d\u2019\u00e9valuations et de preuves m\u00e9dicales permettant d\u2019\u00e9tayer l\u2019opinion de la Dre Bautista selon laquelle le plaignant avait besoin d\u2019une limite hebdomadaire de 40 \u00e0 42 heures de travail l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander si le plaignant \u00e9tait m\u00eame apte \u00e0 travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 produira une preuve sur sa r\u00e9action aux notes et aux rapports de la Dre Bautista ainsi que sur les mesures qui en ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9, ce qui est pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 15.\n[97] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019EP, l\u2019EPM et les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le rapport du Dr Belchetz semble avoir pour objet de discr\u00e9diter la Dre Bautista en critiquant son diagnostic de l\u2019\u00e9tat du plaignant, ou l\u2019absence de diagnostic, et de mettre en doute le fondement de l\u2019opinion de la Dre Bautista selon laquelle le plaignant avait besoin d\u2019un nombre r\u00e9duit d\u2019heures de travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en cause, ou le fait de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait m\u00eame apte \u00e0 travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 contre-interrogera la Dre Bautista sur ces points. Le Tribunal exercera sa fonction pour \u00e9valuer la fiabilit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la Dre Bautista et d\u00e9terminer le poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage, dans la mesure o\u00f9 celui-ci est pertinent pour la mani\u00e8re dont le Tribunal tranchera les questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[98] Dans son rapport, le Dr Belchetz a convenu avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que les notes et les rapports de la Dre Bautista l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander si le plaignant pouvait accomplir son travail en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, m\u00eame si l\u2019on r\u00e9duisait le nombre d\u2019heures. Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz a pour but d\u2019\u00e9tayer, de mani\u00e8re int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, le contre\u2011interrogatoire auquel l\u2019intim\u00e9 soumettra la Dre Bautista ainsi que d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins du plaignant, de m\u00eame que la preuve qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sentera. Cela est peut-\u00eatre bien pertinent et utile pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019une preuve int\u00e9ress\u00e9e qui appuie la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous le couvert d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert.\n[99] Le rapport de la Dre Bautista ne contient pas de renseignements scientifiques ou techniques qui exigent le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert pour \u00e9clairer le Tribunal. Le rapport du Dr Belchetz n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur une \u00e9valuation ou des recherches objectives \u2013 ses observations pourraient \u00eatre faites par un profane. L\u2019intim\u00e9 peut critiquer la Dre Bautista en recourant au t\u00e9moignage de ses t\u00e9moins, au contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins du plaignant, ainsi qu\u2019aux observations de son avocat.\n[100] Je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est ni pertinent ni n\u00e9cessaire pour faire avancer la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que le Tribunal n\u2019en a pas besoin pour \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 de la Dre Bautista. Le rapport du Dr Belchetz n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Tribunal tire des inf\u00e9rences et des conclusions de fait en vue de trancher les questions qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je consid\u00e8re que la pr\u00e9sentation des inf\u00e9rences toutes faites du Dr Belchetz, qui sont fond\u00e9es sur des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9, sont une tentative pour usurper le r\u00f4le que joue le Tribunal en tant que juge des faits.\nC. L\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion\n[101] Il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion. Le rapport du Dr Belchetz concorde avec la forme qu\u2019exige le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles.\nD. La qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert\n[102] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qualifie le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz [traduction] \u00ab [d\u2019]examen effectu\u00e9 par un pair expert \u00bb et le Dr Belchetz dit que l\u2019on a retenu ses services \u00e0 titre [traduction] \u00ab [d\u2019]expert objectif en la mati\u00e8re \u00bb. Ces termes sont trop g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et vagues pour \u00eatre d\u00e9crits comme des [traduction] \u00ab domaines de comp\u00e9tence \u00bb.\n[103] Le curriculum vit\u00e6 du Dr Belchetz indique qu\u2019il a obtenu son dipl\u00f4me de m\u00e9decine en 2000 et qu\u2019il a termin\u00e9 une r\u00e9sidence en m\u00e9decine familiale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9\u00e9 par le Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins de famille du Canada en 2004. Depuis lors, il a travaill\u00e9 comme urgentiste et a suivi une formation suppl\u00e9mentaire en traumatologie et en r\u00e9animation cardiaque avanc\u00e9e.\n[104] Le Dr Belchetz dit qu\u2019il est un [traduction] \u00ab expert invit\u00e9 \u00bb aupr\u00e8s de Global News et CTV\/Bell Media, et il \u00e9num\u00e8re ses articles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s dans des journaux. Il n\u2019indique aucune recherche, aucun texte universitaire ni aucune exp\u00e9rience de l\u2019enseignement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen par les pairs dans le domaine de la m\u00e9decine familiale. Il ne fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune formation ou exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des examens par les pairs en m\u00e9decine familiale.\n[105] Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que le Dr Belchetz est un expert qui poss\u00e8de une qualification suffisante pour fournir la preuve d\u2019opinion incluse dans son rapport, principalement parce que, selon moi, son opinion n\u2019est rien de plus qu\u2019une inf\u00e9rence toute faite de doutes quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 des notes et des rapports de la Dre Bautista, une inf\u00e9rence qui d\u00e9coule des critiques sur la mani\u00e8re dont cette derni\u00e8re exerce la m\u00e9decine. Je crois qu\u2019un profane \u00e9clair\u00e9 pourrait faire les m\u00eames critiques et arriver aux m\u00eames conclusions, surtout si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 les points pr\u00e9occupants, comme il l\u2019a fait, au Dr Belchetz.\nE. L\u2019analyse co\u00fbts-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices\n[106] Apr\u00e8s une gestion d\u2019instance ordinaire en 2015 et en 2016, au mois d\u2019avril 2016 l\u2019instruction a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e de deux semaines d\u00e9butant le 6 juin 2016. Le 2 juin 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 et obtenu un ajournement jusqu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2016. \u00c0 la CTGI du 9 juin 2016, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait retenu les services du Dr Belchetz pour critiquer les rapports et les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la Dre Bautista qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis en septembre 2015. En r\u00e9ponse, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019instruction soit ajourn\u00e9e du 13 juin jusqu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2016, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9.\n[107] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il avait command\u00e9 le rapport du Dr Belchetz \u00e0 un moment aussi proche de l\u2019instruction, ni expliqu\u00e9 en quoi le rapport \u00e9tait pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 sa cause. Le nouveau rapport du Dr Belchetz a eu pour effet de retarder l\u2019instruction jusqu\u2019au moins le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 et d\u2019augmenter les frais juridiques de toutes les parties, en raison de cette requ\u00eate interlocutoire du plaignant.\n[108] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c), je devrais de toute fa\u00e7on autoriser le Dr Belchetz \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019a pas la qualification d\u2019un expert, et d\u00e9cider plus tard quel poids accorder \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage.\n[109] L\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess impose une fonction de \u00ab gardien \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les facteurs de l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9, de la pertinence, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et de la qualification de l\u2019expert, il faut prendre aussi en compte les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices du t\u00e9moignage, y compris sa valeur probante, par rapport au risque de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019instruction ou pour les autres parties. \u00c0 ce stade, on examine de nouveau l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 du Dr Belchetz dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse des co\u00fbts-b\u00e9n\u00e9fices (paragraphe 34 de l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess). Le paragraphe 18 de l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess \u00e9num\u00e8re les risques possibles pour l\u2019instruction, dont une instruction retard\u00e9e, un ajournement, une hausse des co\u00fbts, des audiences plus longues, un degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence inappropri\u00e9 envers l\u2019expert, la science de pacotille et les batailles d\u2019experts.\n[110] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait \u00e9tat de mon inqui\u00e9tude que le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz est une tentative pour usurper la fonction d\u2019inf\u00e9rence et de recherche de faits du Tribunal en demandant \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019accepter les critiques du Dr Belchetz \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la Dre Bautista, des critiques qui, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, sont celles de l\u2019intim\u00e9 envers la Dre Bautista.\n[111] Le paragraphe 48.9(1) exige que l\u2019instruction se d\u00e9roule de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle. Si je fais droit au t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz, il est possible que le plaignant sollicite un autre ajournement. Il est possible aussi que le plaignant engage d\u2019autres d\u00e9penses pour fournir une preuve en r\u00e9ponse, vraisemblablement de la part d\u2019un troisi\u00e8me m\u00e9decin, en vue de traiter de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz. Ce serait l\u00e0 une bataille d\u2019experts au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 de chaque m\u00e9decin, ce qui n\u2019a aucune pertinence manifeste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions que le Tribunal doit trancher.\n[112] \u00c0 mon avis, la prolongation, le retard et le co\u00fbt accru de l\u2019instruction qu\u2019entra\u00eenerait le fait d\u2019autoriser le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz et de donner au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre sont un risque inutile pour l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus d\u2019instruction et le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au plaignant, compte tenu de l\u2019utilit\u00e9 restreinte du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Belchetz.\nX. Conclusion\n[113] La requ\u00eate du plaignant en vue de faire exclure le rapport et le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix du Dr Belchetz est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

Dans ce dossier la plaignante soumet qu\u2019elle a subi une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite (art. 7 Loi canadienne des droits de la personne) dans le cadre de son processus d\u2019embauche. Elle pr\u00e9tend s\u2019\u00eatre vue refuser le poste pour lequel elle avait postul\u00e9 pour motif de discrimination fond\u00e9 sur le fait que sa candidature aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son lien d\u2019affiliation avec le directeur du Centre pour lequel elle appliquait.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 dans ce dossier pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019audition de la plainte devrait avoir lieu \u00e0 Sorel-Tracy, situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d\u2019Odanak, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la plainte origine et o\u00f9 la grande majorit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins r\u00e9sident.\n[3] La plaignante plaide plut\u00f4t pour que l\u2019audition ait lieu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9side actuellement. Elle pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement avoir des moyens financiers plus restreints qui la place dans une position plus difficile que l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[4] Le Tribunal tient habituellement ses audiences \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e. Le Tribunal s\u2019efforce \u00e9galement de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties lorsqu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de le faire (Warman c. Canadian Heritage Alliance et Melissa Guille, 2006 TCDP 17, au paragraphe 4).\n[5] Le Tribunal peut tenir compte de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 vivent les parties impliqu\u00e9es au dossier, de m\u00eame que des t\u00e9moins qui seront amen\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal peut \u00e9galement tenir compte des moyens financiers dont dispose les parties.\n[6] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plainte origine d\u2019Odanak, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ une trentaine de minutes de Sorel-Tracy. Il est vrai que la plaignante r\u00e9side actuellement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, mais les t\u00e9moins qui seront appel\u00e9s par celle-ci \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans sa cause, et dont elle devra assumer les frais, sont tous r\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Odanak.\n[7] De l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont tous r\u00e9sidents d\u2019Odanak de m\u00eame que les t\u00e9moins que ce dernier d\u00e9sire appeler \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[8] La distance entre Montr\u00e9al et Sorel-Tracy est d\u2019environ 92 km, soit environ une heure. Quant \u00e0 la distance s\u00e9parant la r\u00e9serve d\u2019Odanak et Sorel-Tracy, elle est de 31 km, soit environ 30 minutes.\n[9] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la plainte origine de la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Odanak, que la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins sont r\u00e9sidents de cette r\u00e9gion, dont les t\u00e9moins de la plaignante, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 de plus que tous auront un d\u00e9placement a effectu\u00e9 en se rendant \u00e0 Sorel-Tracy, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il y a plus d\u2019inconv\u00e9nients, incluant les co\u00fbts pour la plaignante, \u00e0 tenir l\u2019audience \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qu\u2019\u00e0 Sorel-Tracy.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte ait lieu \u00e0 Sorel-Tracy, Qu\u00e9bec, dans un endroit o\u00f9 il sera possible de tenir l\u2019audience selon les dispositions que le Tribunal pourra prendre.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n2 septembre 2016",

Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de cesser d\u2019appliquer une d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre des mesures pour appliquer imm\u00e9diatement la pleine signification et la port\u00e9e du principe. L\u2019ordonnance et les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision sont les points de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence principaux sur lesquels se base la formation pour toutes les autres ordonnances \u00e0 venir.\n[3] Suite \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9cision, dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et autres c. le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada), 2016 TCDP 10, la formation a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 et a soulign\u00e9 certains r\u00e9sultats et effets n\u00e9gatifs de la d\u00e9cision et a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de prendre les mesures pour s\u2019y attaquer imm\u00e9diatement. Pour aider la formation \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision et l\u2019ordonnance ult\u00e9rieure, AANC a re\u00e7u la directive de fournir un rapport d\u00e9taill\u00e9 indiquant comment les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es afin de fournir une aide imm\u00e9diate aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[4] En r\u00e9ponse aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de reddition de compte qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es \u00e0 AANC et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019autres soumissions des parties \u00e0 ce sujet, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate actualise l\u2019ordonnance de la formation pour donner suite aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 court terme. D\u2019autres r\u00e9formes \u00e0 court, moyen et long terme du Programme des SEFPN et de l\u2019Entente de 1965, ainsi que d\u2019autres demandes d\u2019indemnisation en vertu des articles 53(2)(e) et 53(3) de la LCDP, seront trait\u00e9es \u00e0 un stade ult\u00e9rieur.\n[5] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN), ainsi que la Commission et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es participant \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019organisme Chiefs of Ontario (COO) et la Nation Nishnawbe Aski (NNA), s\u2019entendent au sujet des ordonnances demand\u00e9es \u00e0 la formation pour r\u00e9pondre, \u00e0 court terme, aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision. Leurs observations et les ordonnances demand\u00e9es sont collectivement d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme celles des plaignantes, de la Commission et des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ou (PCPI) dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Lorsque certaines observations des plaignantes, de la Commission ou des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es diff\u00e8rent, ces observations sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9crites.\nII. Remarques pr\u00e9liminaires\n[6] La formation remercie les parties et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es pour leurs observations les plus r\u00e9centes. Il les a examin\u00e9es attentivement et les a trouv\u00e9es tr\u00e8s utiles. La formation reconna\u00eet le temps, les efforts et les ressources consacr\u00e9s par les parties \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9paration. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la formation appuie la majorit\u00e9 des ordonnances demand\u00e9es par les PCPI.\n[7] La formation est heureux d\u2019apprendre que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a accept\u00e9 de faire un certain nombre de choses importantes en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et qu\u2019il a fait quelque progr\u00e8s dans l\u2019application des conclusions et ordonnances de la d\u00e9cision. Dans l\u2019ensemble, la formation estime que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral s\u2019efforce de r\u00e9former son approche des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations et de mettre en place des changements significatifs en ce sens.\n[8] Cela dit, et comme en fait \u00e9tat cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, il reste encore beaucoup de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 accomplir dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat et \u00e0 long terme pour garantir la fin de la discrimination mise en lumi\u00e8re dans la d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, comme la formation l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans sa derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision (2016 TCDP 10), il estime que la diffusion d\u2019une information pertinente et rapide continue d\u2019\u00eatre de la plus haute importance pour reb\u00e2tir la confiance entre les parties et \u00e9viter les conflits et les retards \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[9] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la formation ne parvient pas \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi une grande partie de l\u2019information fournie dans les plus r\u00e9centes observations d\u2019AANC n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre fournie plus t\u00f4t, surtout si cette information faisait partie du raisonnement permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir le budget du Programme des SEFPN de mars 2016. AANC aurait d\u00fb savoir que cette information \u00e9tait et demeure importante pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes et aux ordonnances de la formation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019information et de production de rapports. En fait, la formation et les PCPI r\u00e9clament ce type d\u2019information depuis des mois. Il incombe \u00e0 AANC et au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de mettre en \u0153uvre les conclusions et les ordonnances de la formation, de communiquer clairement leur fa\u00e7on d\u2019y parvenir, notamment en fournissant le raisonnement derri\u00e8re leurs actions, ainsi que des donn\u00e9es et\/ou des documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui, afin d\u2019assurer \u00e0 la formation et aux parties que la mise en \u0153uvre est en cours.\n[10] AANC a \u00e9galement reconnu les PCPI en tant que partenaires dans le processus de r\u00e9forme et reconnu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de consulter les peuples autochtones partout au Canada afin d\u2019obtenir leur avis sur les r\u00e9formes. Bien que cela soit n\u00e9cessaire et en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019obligation du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de consulter les peuples autochtones, encore une fois, une am\u00e9lioration de la communication entourant les initiatives aiderait grandement la formation \u00e0 comprendre la strat\u00e9gie d\u2019AANC pour donner suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et contribuerait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la confiance n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un partenariat entre les parties. Il est aussi difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 dans la communaut\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 ce stade, notamment les travailleurs sociaux et autres experts dans le domaine de la protection de l\u2019enfance, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Sur ce dernier point, AANC a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu n\u2019avoir aucune expertise en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Par cons\u00e9quent, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de consulter des experts dans le domaine, y compris la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, devrait \u00eatre une priorit\u00e9.\n[11] \u00c9galement, la formation a \u00e9mis un certain nombre de remarques depuis la d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019importance des rencontres entre les parties pour discuter de la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN et de l\u2019Entente de 1965, dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat et \u00e0 long terme. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la formation note que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, l\u2019APN et AANC n\u2019ont m\u00eame pas mentionn\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leurs plus r\u00e9centes observations, qu\u2019ils s\u2019\u00e9taient rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 plusieurs reprises pour discuter des r\u00e9formes et du r\u00e9tablissement du Comit\u00e9 consultatif national (CCN). Cette information est importante parce que la capacit\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 travailler ensemble \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate est un bon moyen de tester si le r\u00e9tablissement du CCN entra\u00eenera le succ\u00e8s de la r\u00e9forme de la prestation de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 long terme. AANC a besoin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses aptitudes en communication et en \u00e9change d\u2019information avec les autres parties et la formation, tout en continuant \u00e0 construire le partenariat qu\u2019il a reconnu. En outre, la formation demande d\u2019\u00eatre tenu inform\u00e9 de tout protocole d\u2019entente et\/ou accord pertinent conclu entre les parties et\/ou des r\u00e9unions importantes tenues pour discuter du sujet de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[12] Comme toujours, la formation continue d\u2019encourager les parties \u00e0 communiquer efficacement et \u00e0 travailler ensemble. Il reste \u00e9galement dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 aider les parties \u00e0 atteindre cet objectif. Alors que la formation s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination et \u00e0 s\u2019assurer de la r\u00e9forme de la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, et qu\u2019il continuera \u00e0 superviser l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses ordonnances \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il croit aussi fermement que la collaboration entre les parties en dehors des quatre murs du Tribunal est le meilleur moyen d\u2019assurer une r\u00e9conciliation et des r\u00e9formes efficaces maintenant et dans l\u2019avenir. Toutes les parties sont clairement d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9conciliation et devraient continuer \u00e0 tenter de travailler ensemble pour atteindre cet objectif.\n[13] Cela dit, la formation formulera de nouvelles ordonnances au besoin afin de s\u2019assurer que la discrimination est \u00e9limin\u00e9e. Dans cet ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la formation se prononcera sur certaines mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et discutera d\u2019autres mesures lors d\u2019une prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne. La formation comprend que certaines parties souhaitent que ce processus correctif progresse plus rapidement. M\u00eame si la formation partage ce sentiment, rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination mentionn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision est une question complexe et d\u00e9pend beaucoup de la mani\u00e8re par laquelle les renseignements lui sont fournis. En fait, certains PCPI ont mis en garde la formation en lui conseillant la prudence dans sa mani\u00e8re de formuler ses ordonnances en ce qui concerne la justesse et les r\u00e9percussions. En cons\u00e9quence, la formation souhaite que toutes les parties aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs points de vue et qu\u2019il ait, lui, toute l\u2019information n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre des ordonnances \u00e9clair\u00e9es. La formation esp\u00e8re n\u00e9anmoins voir des changements se concr\u00e9tiser dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais. Il croit que certains de ces changements peuvent \u00eatre imm\u00e9diats puisque les organismes de protection de la jeunesse des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont en cours de r\u00e9forme par la voie de consultations avec les peuples autochtones et les parties en cause. La formation rend la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate suivante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nIII. Le Programme des SEFPN\n[14] Le rapport d\u2019AANC, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate rendue par la formation 2016 TCDP 10, a fourni des renseignements sur les mesures prises pour rem\u00e9dier imm\u00e9diatement aux lacunes du Programme des SEFPN mis en lumi\u00e8re dans la d\u00e9cision. AANC soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019emploie \u00e0 corriger ces lacunes gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 de nouveaux investissements financiers dans le Programme des SEFPN et en modifiant ses mod\u00e8les de financement existants, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme compl\u00e8te du Programme des SEFPN puisse \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. AANC est donc d\u2019avis que beaucoup des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates propos\u00e9es par les PCPI doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une r\u00e9forme, \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme, du Programme des SEFPN apr\u00e8s une consultation pouss\u00e9e avec les partenaires cl\u00e9s.\n[15] Dans son plus r\u00e9cent rapport, AANC souligne les nouveaux investissements financiers dans le Programme des SEFPN allou\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dans son budget 2016 pour les cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es, ainsi que les cr\u00e9dits budg\u00e9taires de chaque organisme fournissant des SEFPN pour l\u2019exercice en cours et les mod\u00e8les de financement utilis\u00e9s pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ces budgets.\n[16] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les PCPI soutiennent qu\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 comment, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les nouveaux investissements dans le Programme des SEFPN seront suffisants pour r\u00e9pondre aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, surtout \u00e0 court terme.\n[17] Pour les motifs suivants, la formation est d\u2019avis que les autres ordonnances, y compris les renseignements et la production de rapports suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019AANC, doivent garantir que les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, en ce qui concerne le Programme des SEFPN, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ou seront abord\u00e9es \u00e0 court terme.\nA. Rectifications du mod\u00e8le de financement \u2013 lacunes et hypoth\u00e8ses\n[18] Une des principales conclusions de la d\u00e9cision est que le Programme des SEFPN d\u2019AANC, d\u2019o\u00f9 provient le financement par le biais de formules, Directive 20-1 et l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention (AAAP), offre un financement fond\u00e9 sur des hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es au sujet du nombre d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s, du nombre de familles qui ont besoin de services et des niveaux de population qui ne refl\u00e8tent pas avec exactitude les besoins r\u00e9els en mati\u00e8re de service de nombreuses communaut\u00e9s dans les r\u00e9serves. Il en r\u00e9sulte un financement fixe insuffisant pour les co\u00fbts d\u2019exploitation (d\u00e9penses en immobilisation, bureaux multiples, ajustement au co\u00fbt de la vie, salaires et avantages sociaux du personnel, formation, frais juridiques, frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9loignement et aux voyages) et les co\u00fbts de pr\u00e9vention (services primaires, secondaires et tertiaires pour maintenir les enfants en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans leur milieu familial), ce qui entrave la capacit\u00e9 des organismes fournissant des SEFPN d\u2019offrir des services provinciaux\/territoriaux mandat\u00e9es de protection sociale aux enfants, sans parler des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture. Plus important encore, le manque de financement pour les co\u00fbts d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention constitue une incitation \u00e0 placer les enfants parce que les frais d\u2019entretien admissibles pour prendre soin d\u2019un enfant pris en charge sont remboursables au co\u00fbt (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 384\u2011389 et 458).\n[19] Dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, la formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de prendre imm\u00e9diatement des mesures pour rem\u00e9dier aux hypoth\u00e8ses et aux lacunes dans ses mod\u00e8les de financement, y compris tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments soulign\u00e9s aux paragraphes 20 et 23 de cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. AANC devait produire un rapport d\u00e9taill\u00e9 expliquant comment ces lacunes et hypoth\u00e8ses sont abord\u00e9es dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat pour fournir un soulagement imm\u00e9diat aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves. L\u2019ordonnance de la formation a \u00e9galement exig\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC fournisse des informations d\u00e9taill\u00e9es sur les cr\u00e9dits budg\u00e9taires pour chaque organisme fournissant le Programme des SEFPN et un calendrier de remise de ces allocations, y compris les calculs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des montants re\u00e7us par chaque organisme en 2015-2016; les donn\u00e9es fiables pour effectuer ces calculs; et, les montants re\u00e7us ou \u00e0 recevoir en 2016-2017 pour chacun, avec un calcul d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des rajustements faits \u00e0 la suite des mesures imm\u00e9diates prises pour r\u00e9pondre aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision (voir 2016 TCDP 10, aux paragraphes 20-25).\n[20] Depuis la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, AANC soutient que les investissements li\u00e9s aux mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates du Canada aideront \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination identifi\u00e9e par le Tribunal et am\u00e9lioreront les r\u00e9sultats pour les familles et les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les investissements offriront des services de pr\u00e9vention plus importants aux familles et soutiendront la stabilit\u00e9 du Programmes des SEFPN dont elles ont cruellement besoin, tout en assurant qu\u2019aucune perturbation des services ne se produise durant les travaux de r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN.\n[21] Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un investissement accru dans le Programme des SEFPN, AANC soutient qu\u2019il \u00e9limine le recours \u00e0 la Directive 20-1. Lorsque la Directive 20-1 s\u2019applique, les organismes fournissant des SEFPN recevront leur financement par le biais de m\u00e9canismes existants durant le pr\u00e9sent exercice, mais avec une augmentation des niveaux de financement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aide du mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9vision des co\u00fbts de l\u2019AAAP le plus \u00e0 jour. En 2016-2017, AANC investit 17,5 M$ dans les services et programmes de pr\u00e9vention comme aide imm\u00e9diate pour les organismes fournissant des SEFPN encore sous le r\u00e9gime de la Directive 20-1.\n[22] Pour les comp\u00e9tences sous le mod\u00e8le de financement AAAP, AANC indique que les mises \u00e0 jour incluent : des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires pour tenir compte des augmentations de population; des rajustements \u00e0 la hausse pour 26 organismes dont plus de 6 % des enfants sont pris en charge; des rajustements de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du personnel pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 avec les taux provinciaux; mise \u00e0 jour pour refl\u00e9ter les changements dans les normes provinciales (p. ex. les ratios de charge de travail pour les travailleurs sociaux ou d\u2019autres intervenants de premi\u00e8re ligne) et pour appuyer les services d\u2019accueil et d\u2019enqu\u00eate; des mises \u00e0 jour des normes de prestation des services, telles que l\u2019augmentation du pourcentage utilis\u00e9 pour calculer les services d\u2019urgence en dehors des heures de travail et un financement accru pour les voyages du personnel; un financement accru pour les services d\u2019audit, les services d\u2019assurance et les services juridiques des organismes; et une augmentation des sommes allou\u00e9es pour l\u2019achat de services par enfant (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. que les fournisseurs recevront 175 $ par enfant de 0 \u00e0 18 ans servi, quelle que soit la comp\u00e9tence).\n[23] AANC soumet que les montants du budget 2016 allou\u00e9s pour combler les lacunes dans la Directive 20-1 et l\u2019AAAP sont plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 par AANC dans sa communication de 2012 The Way Forward (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 295\u2011298). Sur cinq ans, la communication The Way Forward a estim\u00e9 \u00e0 108 M$ le co\u00fbt pour, entre autres choses, \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019AAAP aux comp\u00e9tences toujours sous la Directive 20\u20111, alors que les comp\u00e9tences AAAP existantes ont re\u00e7u un compl\u00e9ment. Tandis que les PCPI se concentrent sur la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019investissement du budget 2016, affirmant que le nouveau financement est en de\u00e7\u00e0 des totaux estim\u00e9s pour cinq ans dans la communication The Way Forward, AANC soutient, lui, que le point de comparaison appropri\u00e9 est plut\u00f4t la cinqui\u00e8me ann\u00e9e d\u2019investissement du budget 2016. C\u2019est que le budget 2016 propose 176,8 M$ la cinqui\u00e8me ann\u00e9e pour, entre autres choses, \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e des services ax\u00e9s sur la pr\u00e9vention aux comp\u00e9tences sous la Directive 20\u20111 et offrir un compl\u00e9ment de financement dans celles op\u00e9rant sous l\u2019AAAP.\n[24] En ce qui concerne les petits organismes de SEFPN, AANC indique que les organismes avec moins de 800 enfants plac\u00e9s seront toujours assujettis \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle en ce qui concerne leur financement de base (frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour le conseil d\u2019administration, salaires, avantages, formation et voyage, financement pour les \u00e9valuations de l\u2019organisme, les v\u00e9rifications, les frais juridiques, les frais d\u2019assurance et d\u2019administration). Toutefois, cela ne diminue pas le financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un organisme pour les services de protection ou de pr\u00e9vention. Selon AANC, les futures approches de financement de petits organismes feront partie de l\u2019engagement \u00e0 plus long terme avec les partenaires provinciaux et les Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[25] Les PCPI soutiennent que la v\u00e9ritable \u00e9valuation de l\u2019impact des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates d\u2019AANC est le degr\u00e9 auquel l\u2019incitation \u00e0 retirer de leurs foyers les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite. Ils font valoir que le rapport de conformit\u00e9 d\u2019AANC est d\u00e9pourvu de garanties que les incitations \u00e0 placer les enfants, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision, seront r\u00e9duites par ses investissements dans les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates et par les changements \u00e0 ses mod\u00e8les de financement; ils soutiennent \u00e9galement qu\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les programmes d\u2019investissements suppl\u00e9mentaires permettront aux organismes fournissant des SEFPN d\u2019offrir des services comparables \u00e0 ceux fournis par les provinces.\n[26] Alors que des r\u00e9ajustements vers le haut sont faits pour les organismes desservant plus de 6 % des enfants plac\u00e9s, les PCPI sont incertains quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue \u00e0 laquelle le pourcentage r\u00e9el d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s est financ\u00e9. En outre, il ne semble pas y avoir de rajustements vers le haut pour les organismes desservant plus de 20 % des familles dans le besoin. Pour les petits organismes, les PCPI soutiennent qu\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019option de reporter les probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du financement de base selon les niveaux de population.\n[27] Les PCPI demandent une ordonnance en vertu de laquelle AANC r\u00e9ajuste imm\u00e9diatement ses mod\u00e8les de financement pour s\u2019assurer que les budgets d\u2019exploitation des organismes fournissant des SEFPN se rapprochent des co\u00fbts r\u00e9els. Ils proposent diverses modifications aux mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019AANC, notamment :\n\u00b7 une augmentation des montants de base dans le mod\u00e8le, y compris le montant des achats pour les enfants;\n\u00b7 que les organismes fournissant des SEFPN, au service d\u2019une population o\u00f9 le pourcentage d\u2019enfants pris en charge et le pourcentage de familles qui re\u00e7oivent des services d\u00e9passent 6 % et 20 % respectivement, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un rajustement \u00e0 la hausse pour leurs budgets d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention au prorata des pourcentages exc\u00e9dentaires;\n\u00b7 qu\u2019aucun rajustement \u00e0 la baisse ne soit appliqu\u00e9 aux organismes fournissant des SEFPN avec moins de 6 % des enfants plac\u00e9s et\/ou servant moins de 20 % des familles;\n\u00b7 que les rajustements du montant fixe dans le mod\u00e8le de financement pour les niveaux de population soient augment\u00e9s; et\n\u00b7 que le montant fixe dans le mod\u00e8le de financement pour tous les organismes fournissant des SEFPN servant moins de 251 enfants autochtones inscrits soit le m\u00eame que celui vers\u00e9 aux organismes qui en servent 251 et plus.\n[28] La formation reconna\u00eet les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent par AANC et son d\u00e9sir d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la vie des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations au moyen de n\u00e9gociations avec les partenaires cl\u00e9s. La formation estime aussi que l\u2019explication d\u2019AANC, d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 23 ci-dessus, est raisonnable, le montant du financement \u00e9tant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui mentionn\u00e9 dans la communication The Way Forward en 2012. Mis \u00e0 part le montant global des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires investis dans le Programme des SEFPN, la formation a appris avec plaisir qu\u2019un nouveau financement (environ 28,4 M$) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 aux organismes fournissant des SEFPN le 1er juillet 2016, et que d\u2019autres fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires seraient accord\u00e9s avant la fin du pr\u00e9sent exercice, en partie pour corriger certaines des hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es contenues dans les mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019AANC.\n[29] Toutefois, comme la formation a indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 482, \u00ab Au-del\u00e0 du simple financement, il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9orienter le programme de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 respecter les principes des droits de la personne et \u00e0 tenir compte des saines pratiques en mati\u00e8re de travail social. \u00bb La formation s\u2019inqui\u00e8te de lire dans les observations d\u2019AANC le m\u00eame type de d\u00e9clarations et de raisonnement d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9s par l\u2019organisation dans le pass\u00e9. Par exemple, qu\u2019il appartient \u00e0 chaque organisme fournissant des SEFPN de d\u00e9terminer comment il affecte le financement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention et aux services de programmation culturelle (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 187 \u00e0 189, 311, 313 et 314). Ceci soul\u00e8ve la m\u00eame question qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019audience : que se passe-t-il si le financement n\u2019est pas suffisant pour permettre cette flexibilit\u00e9? Comment AANC a-t-il d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que chaque organisme dispose d\u2019un financement suffisant pour se conformer aux normes provinciales de bien-\u00eatre des enfants et \u00eatre encore en mesure de faire de la pr\u00e9vention et d\u2019offrir des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture? Le fait que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s, tel que d\u00e9terminer le financement des petits organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 plus tard est le reflet de la vieille mentalit\u00e9 qui r\u00e8gne \u00e0 AANC et qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte. Cela peut supposer qu\u2019AANC est toujours aliment\u00e9 par de l\u2019information et des politiques qui rel\u00e8vent de cette mentalit\u00e9 r\u00e9trograde et qui m\u00e8nent \u00e0 la discrimination. En effet, la formation a cibl\u00e9 les d\u00e9fis auxquels font face les organismes et communaut\u00e9s de petite taille ou \u00e9loign\u00e9s partout au Canada, et ce, \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises dans la d\u00e9cision (voir p. ex. les paragraphes 153, 277, 284, 287, 291, 313 et 314). AANC a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 ces questions et en est conscient depuis un certain temps; pourtant, il n\u2019a toujours pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9labor\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie pour y rem\u00e9dier.\n[30] L\u2019accent sur les discussions avec des partenaires cl\u00e9s \u00e0 des tables tripartites est aussi quelque chose que cette formation a vu dans la preuve et entendu plusieurs fois de la part d\u2019AANC tout au long de ces proc\u00e9dures (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 138, 139, 191 \u00e0 197, 201 et 213 \u00e0 215). Les situations au Qu\u00e9bec et en Colombie-Britannique en constituent l\u2019un des principaux exemples dans la preuve. Malgr\u00e9 de nombreuses consultations, discussions et \u00e9tudes conjointes dans le pass\u00e9, et m\u00eame avec des partenaires dispos\u00e9s et bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9s \u00e0 la transition des provinces assujetties \u00e0 la Directive 20-1 vers l\u2019AAAP, cette transition est toujours \u00e0 faire ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement retard\u00e9e (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 73 \u00e0 77 et 314).\n[31] Bien que la formation comprenne que les changements ainsi qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme significative \u00e0 long terme se feront en consultation avec des partenaires cl\u00e9s, tels que les peuples autochtones partout au Canada et dans les provinces, le but de l\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate a \u00e9t\u00e9, et est toujours, d\u2019\u00e9liminer le plus d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables possibles en ce moment en fonction des renseignements dont nous disposons, des conclusions de la d\u00e9cision et de l\u2019aide d\u2019experts, des organismes fournissant des SEFPN et des parties. L\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate est une mesure temporaire visant \u00e0 supprimer le plus grand nombre possible d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables tout en sachant que la collecte de donn\u00e9es, les \u00e9tudes et consultations se traduiront par un changement plus global et efficace du Programme des SEFPN.\n[32] Une r\u00e9forme compl\u00e8te prendra un certain temps. La formation le comprend et croit qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme compl\u00e8te arrivera. Cependant, l\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme tel et non comme une solution \u00e0 long terme. Bien que des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires puissent r\u00e9soudre les aspects les plus discriminatoires des mod\u00e8les de financement \u00e0 court terme d\u2019AANC, la formation n\u2019est pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer si c\u2019est le cas actuellement. La formation reconna\u00eet et appr\u00e9cie une large part de l\u2019information suppl\u00e9mentaire que fournit AANC en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10; cependant, m\u00eame avec ces renseignements additionnels, la justification ou la m\u00e9thodologie d\u2019attribution du financement suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019est pas totalement expliqu\u00e9e et les donn\u00e9es et les documents, y compris l\u2019\u00e9tude des facteurs de co\u00fbts et l\u2019analyse des tendances \u00e0 partir desquels les revendications d\u2019investissements du budget 2016 dans le Programme des SEFPN ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es, sont incomplets.\n[33] Autrement dit, dans son analyse, la formation ne se pr\u00e9occupe pas du montant pr\u00e9cis du financement en soi, mais plut\u00f4t de la fa\u00e7on dont il est \u00e9tabli. C\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont le Programme des SEFPN est ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 et dont le financement est \u00e9tabli qui entra\u00eene des effets discriminatoires pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L\u2019accent de la formation est mis de v\u00e9rifier si le financement est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 partir d\u2019une \u00e9valuation des circonstances et des besoins distincts des enfants, des familles et des communaut\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations. M\u00eame si d\u2019autres facteurs entrent en jeu pour d\u00e9terminer si le montant du financement accord\u00e9 aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN est adapt\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des communaut\u00e9s qu\u2019ils servent, tels que l\u2019\u00e9loignement et l\u2019ampleur des d\u00e9placements pour rencontrer des enfants et des familles (des sujets trait\u00e9s plus loin dans cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate), les hypoth\u00e8ses sur le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge, le nombre de familles qui ont besoin de services et les niveaux de population constituent le point de d\u00e9part pour aborder les effets discriminatoires des mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019AANC.\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait de laisser quelques hypoth\u00e8ses et lacunes dans les mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019une r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme pour s\u2019assurer que tout le monde soit consult\u00e9 peut \u00eatre probl\u00e9matique. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision, une approche fragmentaire de la r\u00e9forme n\u2019est pas une fa\u00e7on efficace de proc\u00e9der (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 185 et 331). La formation comprend qu\u2019AANC est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9former l\u2019ensemble du Programme des SEFPN et croit qu\u2019il entend le faire, mais il craint que le report d\u2019une action imm\u00e9diate en faveur de la r\u00e9forme et de la consultation \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure perp\u00e9tue la discrimination que le Programme des SEFPN a favoris\u00e9e pendant les 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, malgr\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes bien document\u00e9s sur le programme, les consultations avec ses partenaires et la participation \u00e0 des tables tripartites, le syst\u00e8me d\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019adapter aux besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations (p. ex. voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 134,138 \u00e0 141, 203, 311, 314 \u00e0 315, 383 \u00e0 394 et 456 \u00e0 467). La formation comprend que ce n\u2019est pas une t\u00e2che facile et que le Programme des SEFPN ne peut pas \u00eatre r\u00e9form\u00e9 instantan\u00e9ment. Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas que des mesures efficaces ne peuvent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019intervalle. La formation partage \u00e9galement l\u2019avis des parties qu\u2019une approche uniformis\u00e9e ne doit pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e; cela a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision (voir paragraphe 315).\n[35] Tout au long de la d\u00e9cision, la formation a soulign\u00e9 la dichotomie entre les objectifs du Programme des SEFPN et les m\u00e9thodes inefficaces d\u2019AANC pour la r\u00e9alisation de ces objectifs (voir p. ex. paragraphe 312). Un bon nombre de ces lacunes peuvent \u00eatre corrig\u00e9es en ce moment, sans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de nouvelles \u00e9tudes et consultations \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle. Encore une fois, l\u2019objectif est d\u2019\u00e9liminer autant que possible les effets pr\u00e9judiciables durant l\u2019examen et la r\u00e9forme du syst\u00e8me. Comme l\u2019ont indiqu\u00e9 les PCPI, reporter la r\u00e9solution des hypoth\u00e8ses et des lacunes dans ses mod\u00e8les de financement pour y faire face seulement \u00e0 long terme n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une option offerte \u00e0 AANC. \u00c0 titre de fournisseur de services, bailleur de fonds et gestionnaire du Programme des SEFPN, AANC b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019une certaine souplesse dans la mani\u00e8re d\u2019aborder les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision. Cependant, dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, la formation a exprim\u00e9 clairement que les mesures imm\u00e9diates soulign\u00e9es et d\u00e9finies dans cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate devaient \u00eatre entreprises maintenant alors qu\u2019une autre r\u00e9forme \u00e0 plus long terme \u00e9tait envisag\u00e9e.\n[36] La formation r\u00e9it\u00e8re ses ordonnances sur les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates afin que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe 20 de la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, sans se limiter aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9s, soient corrig\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement, y compris les effets pr\u00e9judiciables li\u00e9s :\n\u00b7 aux hypoth\u00e8ses concernant les enfants plac\u00e9s, les familles qui ont besoin de services et les niveaux de population;\n\u00b7 aux organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e et\/ou aux petits organismes;\n\u00b7 \u00e0 l\u2019inflation\/au co\u00fbt de la vie et aux co\u00fbts pour changer les normes de service;\n\u00b7 aux salaires et avantages, \u00e0 la formation, aux frais juridiques, aux primes d\u2019assurance, aux frais de d\u00e9placement, aux bureaux multiples, aux immobilisations, aux programmes et services culturellement adapt\u00e9s et aux mesures moins perturbatrices.\n[37] En ce qui a trait plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e, la formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019AANC \u00e9labore une strat\u00e9gie qui tient compte d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que les co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires associ\u00e9s aux distances \u00e0 parcourir entre les centres de service en termes de similarit\u00e9 avec les temps r\u00e9glementaires de r\u00e9ponse provinciale et la gestion des r\u00e9percussions sur les fournisseurs de services et sur les enfants et les familles qu\u2019ils servent; la disponibilit\u00e9 des services \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 ou leur absence; et, les frais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le co\u00fbt de la vie plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans les r\u00e9gions nordiques ou isol\u00e9es. L\u2019\u00e9loignement peut affecter chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans le budget d\u2019un organisme fournissant des SEFPN. La formation traitera de la question de l\u2019\u00e9loignement ci-dessous.\n[38] Encore une fois, les objectifs du Programme des SEFPN peuvent \u00eatre satisfaits uniquement si la m\u00e9thode de financement d\u2019AANC est ax\u00e9e sur les niveaux de service et les besoins r\u00e9els des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui peuvent varier d\u2019un enfant, d\u2019une famille ou d\u2019une nation \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Mettre l\u2019accent sur le montant global du financement, en l\u2019appliquant sur des mod\u00e8les de financement imparfaits, a peu d\u2019effet, si ce n\u2019est pas du tout, pour \u00e9liminer la discrimination reconnue dans la d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 AANC d\u2019\u00e9tablir imm\u00e9diatement les hypoth\u00e8ses de financement de 6 % des enfants plac\u00e9s et 20 % des familles dans le besoin de services \u00e0 titre de normes minimales seulement. AANC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9duira pas le montant de financement des organismes dont le nombre d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s est inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 6 %. AANC a re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre d\u2019appliquer les m\u00eames normes pour l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de 20 % des familles qui ont besoin de services. Autrement dit, le montant de financement ne sera pas r\u00e9duit pour les organismes fournissant des SEFPN qui desservent moins de 20 % des familles qui ont besoin de services.\n[39] Pour les organismes qui ont plus de 6 % des enfants plac\u00e9s ou qui servent plus de 20 % des familles, AANC doit calculer leur financement en se basant sur une \u00e9valuation des niveaux r\u00e9els d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s et de familles n\u00e9cessitant des services. Bien qu\u2019AANC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il accordera des rajustements \u00e0 la hausse \u00e0 26 organismes fournissant des SEFPN dont plus de 6 % des enfants sont plac\u00e9s, il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de renseignements attestant que ces rajustements sont fond\u00e9s sur une \u00e9valuation du nombre r\u00e9el d\u2019enfants pris en charge. En outre, AANC n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux organismes servant plus de 20 % des familles. Comme il est expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019ordonnance \u00e0 la fin de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, AANC devra se rapporter au Tribunal pour confirmer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance et d\u00e9montrer clairement comment cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Encore une fois, cette ordonnance vise seulement \u00e0 procurer une aide \u00e0 court terme \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme compl\u00e8te du Programme des SEFPN se produira \u00e0 long terme apr\u00e8s d\u2019autres consultations avec les peuples autochtones, les partenaires et des experts de partout au Canada.\n[40] Pour les hypoth\u00e8ses dans les mod\u00e8les de financement fond\u00e9es sur les niveaux de population, AANC a re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre d\u2019arr\u00eater imm\u00e9diatement de r\u00e9duire de fa\u00e7on st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e le financement en se fondant sur des seuils de population arbitraires. Encore une fois, le financement doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une \u00e9valuation des besoins r\u00e9els de niveau de service des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN. Comme la formation l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, AANC devra se rapporter au Tribunal pour confirmer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance et d\u00e9montrer clairement comment cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[41] \u00c0 ce propos, et comme il est abord\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous, la formation a besoin de plus de renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on dont AANC a \u00e9tabli son plan quinquennal d\u2019investissement dans le Programme des SEFPN et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les budgets pour chaque organisme SEFPN. La formation note qu\u2019il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 certains documents de mod\u00e8le de co\u00fbts d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal et dans les plus r\u00e9centes observations d\u2019AANC qui fournissent certains de ces renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, ces renseignements doivent \u00eatre encore plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9s pour expliquer clairement comment les besoins des enfants et des familles sont pris en consid\u00e9ration en r\u00e9ponse aux ordonnances et des conclusions de la formation.\n[42] Par ailleurs, compte tenu de l\u2019accent mis sur la consultation par AANC en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, il serait utile \u00e0 la formation et aux autres parties qu\u2019AANC puisse fournir une liste des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des organismes fournissant des SEFPN, des autorit\u00e9s provinciales et territoriales, des partenaires, des experts ou de toute autre personne consult\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent en r\u00e9ponse aux conclusions contenues dans la d\u00e9cision, ainsi que son plan de consultation pour l\u2019avenir. La liste de toutes les consultations lanc\u00e9es de janvier \u00e0 septembre 2016 doit comprendre l\u2019ordre du jour et un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des discussions.\nB. Le financement pour les frais juridiques, les immobilisations, les services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, le montant vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019achat de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et les rapports sur la r\u00e9ception, l\u2019\u00e9valuation et les enqu\u00eates en lien avec la protection des enfants.\n[43] Selon AANC, la question du financement des frais juridiques, de l\u2019immobilisation et des programmes et services adapt\u00e9s seront abord\u00e9s dans le cadre des discussions de la r\u00e9forme \u00e0 venir. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 certaines de ces questions peut n\u00e9cessiter de la participation des Premi\u00e8res Nations et des discussions avec ces derni\u00e8res, les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN et les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux. Du point de vue d\u2019AANC, une action unilat\u00e9rale pour traiter ces questions importantes serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019engagement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vue de renouveler la relation entre le Canada et les peuples autochtones. AANC ajoute que des investissements de secours imm\u00e9diats pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins individuels de chaque collectivit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de programmes et d\u2019activit\u00e9s adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture.\n[44] En ce qui concerne le montant vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019achat de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, AANC indique une augmentation de 100 $ \u00e0 175 $ par enfant. Dans ses rapports sur la r\u00e9ception des plaintes, les \u00e9valuations et les enqu\u00eates en lien avec la protection des enfants, AANC soutient que les investissements du budget 2016 fourniront environ 45 M$ sur les cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es en fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires en soutien aux services d\u2019accueil et d\u2019enqu\u00eate qui comprennent des activit\u00e9s telles que les rapports de r\u00e9ception, d\u2019\u00e9valuation et d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la protection des enfants.\n[45] Pour leur part, les PCPI ne comprennent pas pourquoi la question du financement des frais juridiques, de l\u2019immobilisation et des programmes et services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture ne peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9e \u00e0 ce stade. Des actions peuvent \u00eatre prises maintenant pour att\u00e9nuer la discrimination qui rel\u00e8vent enti\u00e8rement de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ne d\u00e9pendent pas d\u2019une action provinciale correspondante, notamment l\u2019adoption de normes provinciales\/territoriales applicables relatives \u00e0 ces questions et leur financement ad\u00e9quat. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les PCPI demandent :\n\u00b7 que chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN re\u00e7oive 75 000 $ pour l\u2019exercice 2016-2017 pour d\u00e9velopper ou mettre \u00e0 jour une vision adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la culture pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des enfants et des familles et pour commencer \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper ou mettre \u00e0 jour des normes de service, des programmes et des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019\u00e9valuation fond\u00e9s sur la culture des enfants et des familles;\n\u00b7 que les frais juridiques relatifs aux enfants plac\u00e9s et aux enqu\u00eates sur le bien\u2011\u00eatre des enfants soient enti\u00e8rement rembours\u00e9s au m\u00eame tarif que celui utilis\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des avocats externes;\n\u00b7 que les co\u00fbts de r\u00e9paration soient enti\u00e8rement remboursables lorsqu\u2019un organisme qui fournit des SEFPN a re\u00e7u un avis selon lequel des r\u00e9parations doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es pour se conformer aux r\u00e8glements et codes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 applicables au b\u00e2timent et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention des incendies, ou lorsqu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres preuves de non-conformit\u00e9 avec ces m\u00eames r\u00e8glements et codes.\n[46] Les PCPI demandent que le montant vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019achat de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance soit port\u00e9 \u00e0 200 $ par enfant. Pour ce qui est des rapports de r\u00e9ception, d\u2019\u00e9valuation et d\u2019enqu\u00eate en lien avec la protection des enfants, les PCPI soutiennent qu\u2019ils devraient \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement remboursables.\n[47] Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, la formation n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le montant pr\u00e9cis en soi du financement, mais bien par la fa\u00e7on de l\u2019\u00e9tablir : c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il soit fond\u00e9 sur une \u00e9valuation des circonstances et besoins distincts de chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN. En vertu de ce raisonnement, la formation n\u2019a pas assez d\u2019information en ce moment pour rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une demande d\u2019un montant de financement pr\u00e9cis pour d\u00e9velopper ou mettre \u00e0 jour des normes de service, des programmes et des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019\u00e9valuation adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture des enfants et des familles. La formation reconna\u00eet que de laisser aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN le soin d\u2019utiliser les investissements de secours imm\u00e9diats pour r\u00e9soudre ce point ne garantit pas que ce besoin soit satisfait, surtout dans le cas d\u2019un petit organisme ou d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9e. Cela \u00e9tant, le Tribunal pr\u00e9sentera cette demande \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[48] Comme il est expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10 et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 au paragraphe 36 ci\u2011dessus, le Tribunal s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019AANC traite de la question des frais juridiques dans le cadre des mesures de secours imm\u00e9diat alors qu\u2019une solution \u00e0 plus long terme est en cours d\u2019\u00e9laboration. Bien que la formation comprenne l\u2019avantage d\u2019avoir des discussions sur le financement des frais juridiques \u00e0 long terme, cette question devrait aussi \u00eatre trait\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement. La formation ordonne AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9montrer clairement comment il aborde cette question. Cela fera partie de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[49] \u00c0 propos des r\u00e9novations des b\u00e2timents, la formation ne comprend pas pourquoi AANC ne peut pas agir maintenant, surtout lorsqu\u2019un organisme qui fournit des SEFPN re\u00e7oit un avis selon lequel des r\u00e9parations doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es pour se conformer aux r\u00e8glements et codes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 applicables au b\u00e2timent et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention des incendies, ou lorsqu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres preuves de non-conformit\u00e9 avec ces m\u00eames r\u00e8glements et codes. Une fois de plus, la formation comprend l\u2019avantage d\u2019avoir des discussions sur les immobilisations \u00e0 long terme, mais ce probl\u00e8me urgent devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9solu imm\u00e9diatement. La formation ordonne AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9montrer clairement comment il aborde cette question. Cela fera partie de la prochaine rencontre conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[50] Finalement, en ce qui concerne les questions du montant vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019achat de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et des co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s aux rapports de r\u00e9ception, d\u2019\u00e9valuation et d\u2019enqu\u00eate en lien avec la protection des enfants, encore une fois, la formation exige davantage de renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on dont AANC compte s\u2019y prendre pour que son mode d\u2019affectation de financement de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments r\u00e9ponde aux besoins de chacun des organismes fournissant des SEFPN. La formation ordonne AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9montrer clairement comment il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le financement de tels co\u00fbts. Cela fera partie de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nC. Rajustement pour contrer l\u2019inflation\n[51] Une autre conclusion importante de la d\u00e9cision portait sur le d\u00e9faut d\u2019AANC d\u2019ajuster les niveaux de financement du Directive 20-1 depuis 1995, ainsi que les niveaux de financement pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019AAAP depuis sa mise en \u0153uvre, pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation et du co\u00fbt de la vie.\n[52] AANC indique que les investissements du budget 2016 comprennent un rajustement annuel pour r\u00e9pondre aux futurs facteurs de co\u00fbts et de croissance. Les inducteurs de co\u00fbts qui tiennent compte du taux de croissance annuel moyen comprennent : la croissance du maintien, les charges d\u2019exploitation des organismes (p. ex. loyer, transport, fournitures et \u00e9quipement), les salaires et les augmentations de ratios d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s. Selon AANC, le montant annuel pour la croissance et les facteurs de co\u00fbts a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 3 % des investissements du programme et il injecte 159 M$ en fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es pour r\u00e9gler ces questions.\n[53] Les PCPI soutiennent qu\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 fournir les d\u00e9tails sur les montants qu\u2019il compte verser s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour [traduction] \u00ab la croissance et les futurs facteurs de co\u00fbts \u00bb et n\u2019explique pas clairement comment il est arriv\u00e9 aux montants correspondants. Par ailleurs, les futurs facteurs de co\u00fbts d\u00e9termin\u00e9s ne sont pas tous li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019inflation. En effet, les PCPI font valoir que certains de ces facteurs de co\u00fbts sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la discrimination h\u00e9rit\u00e9e du Programme des SEFPN (par exemple, les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien li\u00e9es aux enfants). En outre, elles soutiennent que le rajustement annuel pour la croissance et les futurs facteurs de co\u00fbts ne fait rien pour r\u00e9gler le d\u00e9savantage syst\u00e9mique perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 par un manque de rajustements li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019inflation au cours des deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies.\n[54] Les PCPI r\u00e9clament un financement accru pour restaurer le pouvoir d\u2019achat perdu en raison de l\u2019omission de fournir un rajustement compos\u00e9 pour contrer l\u2019inflation annuelle en vertu de l\u2019indice des prix \u00e0 la consommation. Pour les exercices 2016-2017 et les suivants, ils demandent des rajustements annuels au financement des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN selon l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019indice des prix \u00e0 la consommation.\n[55] AANC est ordonn\u00e9 de fournir les d\u00e9tails sur les montants qu\u2019il compte verser s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour \u00ab la croissance et les futurs facteurs de co\u00fbts \u00bb et d\u2019expliquer de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e comment il est arriv\u00e9 aux montants correspondants. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la formation a des questions \u00e0 poser \u00e0 AANC, la demande d\u2019un financement accru pour restaurer la perte de pouvoir d\u2019achat sera abord\u00e9e pendant la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nD. D\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts et r\u00e9affectation de fonds provenant d\u2019autres programmes d\u2019AANC\n[56] La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9galement abord\u00e9 la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y avait des d\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts pour les frais d\u2019entretien, et avant de fournir les ressources financi\u00e8res suppl\u00e9mentaires, AANC exige que les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN recouvrent d\u2019abord ces d\u00e9passements en puisant dans le financement attribu\u00e9 aux volets de la pr\u00e9vention et de l\u2019exploitation. \u00c0 ce propos, dans le cas o\u00f9 les co\u00fbts d\u2019entretien d\u00e9passaient le budget du Programme des SEFPN, des fonds d\u2019autres programmes d\u2019AANC \u00e9taient r\u00e9affect\u00e9s, tels que le logement et les infrastructures, pour couvrir ces co\u00fbts d\u2019entretien. Le v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 cette situation qu\u2019il qualifie d\u2019intol\u00e9rable et de n\u00e9faste pour les autres programmes sociaux importants destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[57] Encore une fois, AANC all\u00e8gue que les investissements du budget 2016 ont tenu compte des facteurs de co\u00fbts et des facteurs de croissance, y compris ceux ayant une incidence sur les d\u00e9penses inh\u00e9rentes au maintien. S\u2019il y a une forte pression sur le budget allou\u00e9, des ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires peuvent \u00eatre fix\u00e9es. Les fonds seront allou\u00e9s selon le besoin des organismes pour r\u00e9pondre aux augmentations des frais de maintien, aux changements de salaire au provincial et \u00e0 toute augmentation du ratio des enfants plac\u00e9s.\n[58] En outre, AANC affirme que les investissements du budget 2016 contribueront \u00e0 instaurer un environnement de financement plus stable et plus pr\u00e9visible au sein du minist\u00e8re, r\u00e9duisant ainsi le besoin de r\u00e9affectations provenant d\u2019autres programmes essentiels tels que les infrastructures et le logement. Cependant, AANC fait remarquer que tout engagement concernant le financement de programmes autres que celui des SEFPN d\u00e9borde du cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[59] Les PCPI affirment que seulement 51 830 765,38 $ seront accord\u00e9s aux organismes fournissant des SEFPN pour couvrir les d\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts en 2016\u20112017. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils demandent que la formation ordonne \u00e0 AANC de cesser d\u2019exiger que les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN recouvrent les d\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entretien dans le financement attribu\u00e9 aux volets de la pr\u00e9vention et de l\u2019exploitation. De plus, les PCPI demandent une ordonnance pour qu\u2019AANC mette fin \u00e0 sa pratique de r\u00e9affecter des fonds provenant d\u2019autres programmes destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations pour rem\u00e9dier aux insuffisances des SEFPN.\n[60] La formation ordonne \u00e0 AANC de cesser d\u2019exiger que les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN recouvrent les d\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entretien dans le financement attribu\u00e9 aux volets de la pr\u00e9vention et de l\u2019exploitation. \u00c0 nouveau, ceci assure que les budgets des SEFPN permettent de mieux r\u00e9pondre aux besoins r\u00e9els des enfants et des familles qu\u2019ils servent.\n[61] Bien que la r\u00e9affectation du financement provenant d\u2019autres programmes des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour pallier l\u2019insuffisance des SEFPN puisse sortir du cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la formation a formul\u00e9 des conclusions dans la d\u00e9cision sur les effets n\u00e9fastes de cette pratique (voir par exemple, para 373 et 390). Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation presse AANC pour qu\u2019il \u00e9limine cette pratique.\nE. Demandes de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[62] Les PCPI r\u00e9clament davantage de d\u00e9tails sur les affectations budg\u00e9taires pour le Programme des SEFPN et les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils font remarquer que le rapport de conformit\u00e9 d\u2019AANC stipule qu\u2019une grande partie du financement suppl\u00e9mentaire sera vers\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la [traduction] \u00ab mise en \u0153uvre int\u00e9grale \u00bb du programme et [traduction] \u00ab au cours des cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es \u00bb. Du point de vue des PCPI, AANC n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explication quant \u00e0 la raison du d\u00e9lai de cinq ans pour entreprendre les actions; ils demandent qu\u2019AANC soit ordonn\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son approche progressive pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination. Les PCPI sont \u00e9galement incertains du moment exact o\u00f9 la \u00ab mise en \u0153uvre int\u00e9grale \u00bb sera atteinte, ou du moment \u00ab au cours des cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es \u00bb o\u00f9 bon nombre des mesures propos\u00e9es par AANC entreront en vigueur.\n[63] En outre, m\u00eame si AANC a fourni les mod\u00e8les de financement qui ont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 ses budgets, les PCPI demandent aussi qu\u2019il produise les donn\u00e9es brutes sur lesquelles il s\u2019est fi\u00e9 pour fixer toute augmentation de financement, y compris sa fa\u00e7on de calculer les projections financi\u00e8res au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019exercice 2016-2017, toutes les mesures prises pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 des salaires et avantages sociaux du personnel aux taux provinciaux, les renseignements utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer les ratios du nombre de cas au Qu\u00e9bec et au Manitoba et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les moyens utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer les valeurs pour les services d\u2019urgence en dehors des heures de travail, les frais de d\u00e9placement du personnel, les v\u00e9rifications des organismes, les services juridiques et les assurances.\n[64] Selon AANC, la \u00ab mise en \u0153uvre int\u00e9grale \u00bb du budget 2016 sera atteinte la 4e ann\u00e9e et encore la 5e ann\u00e9e de son plan quinquennal. Les projections financi\u00e8res pour 2017-2018 \u00e0 2020-2021 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9es en pond\u00e9rant l\u2019investissement annuel total des ann\u00e9es 4 et 5. Le financement sera vers\u00e9 progressivement aux organismes parce que, selon AANC, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience pass\u00e9e et des discussions avec les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du financement ont montr\u00e9 que les fonds graduels donnent aux organismes suffisamment de temps pour embaucher, former et retenir son personnel, selon la disponibilit\u00e9 des travailleurs sociaux qualifi\u00e9s et autres main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, et d\u2019\u00e9largir leurs programmes de pr\u00e9vention. AANC soutient que cette approche ne signifie nullement que le Canada suppose que les organismes n\u2019ont pas la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates, mais il reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il faut du temps pour faire cro\u00eetre n\u2019importe quelle organisation, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme pour s\u2019assurer que le financement ne vienne pas \u00e0 manquer.\n[65] AANC ajoute que les mod\u00e8les de financement r\u00e9vis\u00e9s utilis\u00e9s pour soutenir les investissements du budget 2016 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 jour au moyen d\u2019un processus qui a pris plusieurs ann\u00e9es et qui comprend une \u00e9tude des facteurs de co\u00fbts et une analyse des tendances exhaustives bas\u00e9es sur les donn\u00e9es les plus r\u00e9centes disponibles par province\/territoire. En ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement les avantages sociaux du personnel, AANC d\u00e9clare que le montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en calculant 20,45 % du total des salaires. C\u2019est la m\u00e9thodologie convenue lors de la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019AAAP. Dans le cadre de la r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme du Programme des SEFPN, AANC est ouvert \u00e0 poursuivre les discussions sur la modification du calcul des futures allocations des avantages sociaux du personnel.\n[66] Une grande partie de l\u2019information contenue dans les plus r\u00e9centes communications d\u2019AANC, y compris les renseignements sur ses m\u00e9thodes pour d\u00e9terminer le montant du nouveau financement ainsi que la logique de son d\u00e9roulement progressif, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fournie il y a des mois, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019AANC affirme que son \u00e9tude des co\u00fbts et son analyse des tendances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Cette information aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile pour faire avancer plus rapidement la prise des mesures de secours imm\u00e9diat. M\u00eame si l\u2019approche de financement progressif peut suivre le m\u00eame mode de mise en \u0153uvre d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9e pour l\u2019AAAP, la formation demande \u00e0 AANC de lui fournir l\u2019information ci-dessus plut\u00f4t que de se retrouver avec des hypoth\u00e8ses. AANC a re\u00e7u la directive de divulguer \u00e0 la formation et aux PCPI la documentation de l\u2019\u00e9tude des co\u00fbts et de l\u2019analyse des tendances sur lesquels il a bas\u00e9 ses calculs pour l\u2019affectation du financement du budget 2016. De plus, AANC doit fournir sa justification, ses donn\u00e9es et toute autre information pertinente pour aider la formation \u00e0 comprendre les investissements de son budget 2016 et les mesures adopt\u00e9es pour r\u00e9pondre aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, notamment : sa fa\u00e7on de calculer les projections financi\u00e8res au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019exercice 2016\u20112017; toutes les mesures prises pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 des salaires et avantages sociaux du personnel aux taux provinciaux; les renseignements utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer les ratios du nombre de cas au Qu\u00e9bec et au Manitoba; et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les moyens utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer les valeurs pour les services d\u2019urgence en dehors des heures de travail, les frais de d\u00e9placement du personnel, les v\u00e9rifications des organismes, les services juridiques et d\u2019assurance.\nIV. L\u2019Entente de 1965 conclue avec l\u2019Ontario\n[67] En ce qui concerne l\u2019Entente de 1965 en Ontario, la d\u00e9cision a constat\u00e9 que, alors qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait apparemment d\u2019une am\u00e9lioration par rapport \u00e0 la Directive 20-1 et que l\u2019Entente de 1965 paraissait plus avantageuse que l\u2019AAAP, son application se traduit \u00e9galement par des d\u00e9nis de services et des effets n\u00e9fastes pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L\u2019Entente n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour depuis un certain temps et ne tient pas compte des modifications effectu\u00e9es au cours des ann\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario sur des points comme la sant\u00e9 mentale et autres services de pr\u00e9vention. Ceci est aggrav\u00e9 par un manque de coordination entre les programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux sur la sant\u00e9 et les services sociaux qui touchent les enfants et les familles dans le besoin, en d\u00e9pit de ces types de programmes en cours de synchronisation en vertu de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario. La d\u00e9cision souligne \u00e9galement le manque de services de proximit\u00e9 pour appuyer la prestation des services aux enfants et aux familles des r\u00e9serves, notamment dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es, exacerbant encore plus l\u2019\u00e9cart. Enfin, il est expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il y a discordance entre la l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019Ontario et les normes de prestation des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, par exemple, par la nomination d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de bande et l\u2019absence de fonds d\u2019AANC pour le faire (voir les d\u00e9cisions, aux paragraphes 223 \u00e0 246).\n[68] Encore une fois, pour les raisons qui suivent, la formation est d\u2019avis que les autres ordonnances, y compris les renseignements et les rapports suppl\u00e9mentaires que doit produire AANC, doivent garantir que les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, en ce qui concerne l\u2019Entente de 1965, sont prises en compte ou le seront \u00e0 court terme.\nA. Mise \u00e0 jour de l\u2019Entente de 1965\n[69] Les PCPI r\u00e9clament la mise \u00e0 jour des annexes de l\u2019Entente de 1965 afin qu\u2019elles refl\u00e8tent la version actuelle de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario. Ils demandent \u00e9galement une ordonnance garantissant le financement pour la gamme compl\u00e8te des services juridiques, y compris la nomination des repr\u00e9sentants de bande et les services de sant\u00e9 mentale pour enfants, pr\u00e9vus par la l\u00e9gislation sur le bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance de l\u2019Ontario.\n[70] \u00c0 ce sujet, AANC a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaillera activement avec la province de l\u2019Ontario et les intervenants, comme les organisations, la direction et les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les organismes et les fournisseurs de services de premi\u00e8re ligne, pour r\u00e9aliser les r\u00e9formes n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019Entente de 1965. Une rencontre a eu lieu entre les fonctionnaires d\u2019AANC et le minist\u00e8re des Affaires autochtones de l\u2019Ontario pour discuter de diff\u00e9rentes questions, dont le bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance en Ontario. Subs\u00e9quemment, le 11 mars 2016, la ministre d\u2019AANC a rencontr\u00e9 le ministre ontarien des Affaires autochtones pour discuter des grands dossiers prioritaires, notamment des SEFPN en Ontario et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser l\u2019Entente de 1965 de l\u2019Ontario. Selon le Canada, ces rencontres ont ouvert la voie \u00e0 d\u2019autres d\u00e9bats de fond avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, y compris l\u2019organisme COO et autres parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es.\n[71] En outre, le 10 mai 2016, le bureau r\u00e9gional d\u2019AANC de l\u2019Ontario a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au chef r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Ontario, Isadore Day, et \u00e0 la sous-ministre provinciale, Deborah Richardson, pour les informer de l\u2019octroi d\u2019investissements en aide imm\u00e9diate dans les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles de l\u2019Ontario. Cette lettre indique que les fonds destin\u00e9s aux repr\u00e9sentants de bande seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie de la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN.\n[72] En ce qui concerne les services en sant\u00e9 mentale, AANC soutient que 69 M$ seront investis sur les trois prochaines ann\u00e9es en soutien imm\u00e9diat au bien\u2011\u00eatre mental des autochtones partout au Canada. Ce financement s\u2019ajoute \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 300 M$ investis annuellement dans les programmes communautaires de traitement des toxicomanies et de sant\u00e9 mentale dans les r\u00e9serves et les territoires. Selon AANC, ce nouveau financement appuiera diverses mesures dont certaines sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario.\n[73] La formation se r\u00e9jouit des nouveaux et importants investissements mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus. Bien que cela corrige certains des impacts n\u00e9gatifs mis en \u00e9vidence dans la d\u00e9cision, encore une fois, la formation n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019en \u00e9valuer la port\u00e9e que ce soit \u00e0 court ou \u00e0 long terme. AANC est ordonn\u00e9 de fournir sa justification, ses donn\u00e9es et toute autre information pertinente afin d\u2019aider la formation \u00e0 comprendre les investissements de son budget 2016 et dans quelle mesure ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 court terme aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations ainsi qu\u2019aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, en particulier en ce qui concerne les services de sant\u00e9 mentale et les repr\u00e9sentants de bande.\n[74] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la formation est consciente que, contrairement \u00e0 la prestation des services provinciaux et la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario, les services sociaux et les services de sant\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9raux destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont offerts par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de diff\u00e9rents minist\u00e8res. N\u00e9anmoins, la formation a tir\u00e9 ses conclusions \u00e0 partir de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en ce qui concerne les lacunes et les effets n\u00e9fastes caus\u00e9s par la participation du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dans les services de sant\u00e9 et les services sociaux destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario (par exemple, voir la d\u00e9cision, aux paragraphes 364 \u00e0 373 et 391 \u00e0 392). Dans l\u2019ensemble, la formation a jug\u00e9 la situation en Ontario en de\u00e7\u00e0 de l\u2019objectif de l\u2019Entente de 1965 de \u00ab [...] mettre \u00e0 la disposition des Indiens de la province, la gamme compl\u00e8te des programmes d\u2019aide sociale provinciaux \u00bb (voir la d\u00e9cision, au paragraphe 246). Encore une fois, la formation veut savoir comment ces conclusions sont abord\u00e9es \u00e0 court terme alors que l\u2019Entente est en cours de r\u00e9forme.\nB. Quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement\n[75] La NNA avance qu\u2019un nouveau quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement doit \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 afin de s\u2019assurer que le financement aux collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord refl\u00e8te le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la vie et les frais exceptionnels de prestation des services dans ces collectivit\u00e9s. Le nouveau quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement devrait prendre en compte le co\u00fbt de la vie, les donn\u00e9es d\u00e9mographiques des collectivit\u00e9s du Nord o\u00f9 les enfants et les jeunes forment un pourcentage largement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la population que dans le reste du Canada, les taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de mortalit\u00e9 infantile, et les taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de suicide chez les jeunes.\n[76] Selon la NNA, le Rapport Barnes (pi\u00e8ce HR-11, onglet 219 : David Barnes et Vijay Shankar, [[traduction] \u00c9loignement dans le Nord : \u00c9tude et analyse des consid\u00e9rations relatives au mod\u00e8le de financement de la protection de l\u2019enfance pour deux organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations : Tikinagan Child and Family Services et Payukotayno : James Bay and Hudson Bay Family Services] (Barnes Management Group Inc., 2006) fournit un bon exemple de ce \u00e0 quoi sa proposition de quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement pourrait ressembler et de ce qu\u2019un tel quotient pourrait accomplir. Toutefois, le Rapport Barnes est propre \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario, d\u00e9finit plusieurs lacunes dans les donn\u00e9es et a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 2006. La NNA demande donc qu\u2019une mise \u00e0 jour du Rapport Barnes soit financ\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La NNA propose de demander \u00e0 des experts de d\u00e9velopper un nouveau quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement bas\u00e9 sur le Rapport Barnes et propose que la s\u00e9lection des experts se fasse d\u2019un commun accord entre la NNA et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Si aucun accord n\u2019intervient dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable et relativement court, elle demande \u00e0 la formation de s\u00e9lectionner les experts appropri\u00e9s.\n[77] Alors que l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un solide quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement fond\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es empiriques est en cours, la NNA sugg\u00e8re que des ajustements refl\u00e9tant les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9loignement nordique peuvent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat et montre son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 travailler en collaboration avec les parties sur la m\u00e9canique de ces ajustements.\n[78] Consid\u00e9rant que les observations de la NNA ont port\u00e9 principalement sur l\u2019application d\u2019un solide quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour d\u00e9terminer le financement de ses propres communaut\u00e9s en Ontario, l\u2019APN fait valoir que l\u2019application des facteurs d\u2019\u00e9loignement doit \u00eatre mise en pratique partout au Canada. De m\u00eame, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien avance que les questions d\u2019\u00e9loignement ne devraient pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9es avec une \u00ab mise \u00e0 jour \u00bb du Rapport Barnes, mais plut\u00f4t dans le cadre d\u2019une \u00e9tude approfondie et propre \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario qui s\u2019int\u00e8gre dans le travail du CCN. COO s\u2019attend \u00e9galement que le travail du CCN et l\u2019\u00e9tude propre \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario procurent des donn\u00e9es pour servir de base \u00e0 un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement qui, \u00e0 son tour, inspirera des mod\u00e8les pour les programmes et le financement.\n[79] Pour sa part, AANC affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019engage \u00e0 entreprendre et soutenir des recherches sur ce sujet, en s\u2019appuyant sur les \u00e9tudes contenues dans le Rapport Barnes, afin d\u2019examiner un possible quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement.\n[80] La formation convient avec la NNA qu\u2019un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement doit \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019aide \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme et que les donn\u00e9es doivent \u00eatre recueillies de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. La formation se r\u00e9jouit d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019AANC s\u2019engage \u00e0 entreprendre et soutenir la recherche sur ce sujet et \u00e0 ouvrir la discussion sur un possible quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et COO ont fourni des suggestions int\u00e9ressantes sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9tablir un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Ce sujet fera partie de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[81] La formation convient avec la NNA que des ajustements refl\u00e9tant les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9loignement nordique peuvent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un solide quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement fond\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es empiriques. La formation est \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec l\u2019APN que cela ne devrait pas seulement s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario, mais, au contraire, l\u2019application des facteurs d\u2019\u00e9loignement doit s\u2019\u00e9tendre au Canada entier. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t au paragraphe 36, dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, la formation a ordonn\u00e9 AANC de se pencher imm\u00e9diatement sur les moyens de d\u00e9terminer le financement des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e. Cet exercice devrait tenir compte de certains points, notamment : les frais de d\u00e9placement pour fournir ou avoir acc\u00e8s aux services; le co\u00fbt de la vie et de la prestation des services plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es; la capacit\u00e9 des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e \u00e0 recruter et conserver du personnel; et, l\u2019effet compos\u00e9 de la r\u00e9duction du financement de base pour les organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e qui peuvent aussi \u00eatre de petites organismes (par exemple, voir la d\u00e9cision, aux paragraphes 213 \u00e0 233 et 291). Une approche standardis\u00e9e, de type \u00ab uniformis\u00e9e \u00bb, pour d\u00e9terminer le financement des organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e affecte leur capacit\u00e9 globale \u00e0 fournir des services et entra\u00eene des effets n\u00e9fastes pour de nombreux enfants et leur famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations. La formation ordonne AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9montrer clairement comment AANC d\u00e9termine le financement des organismes fournissant des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins r\u00e9els des communaut\u00e9s servies. Cela fera partie de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nC. Allocation des fonds de secours imm\u00e9diat\n[82] AANC a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le budget 2016 pr\u00e9voit de nouveaux investissements d\u2019environ 5,8 M$ en Ontario en 2016-2017. Par 2019-2020, l\u2019allocation annuelle totale pour les services de pr\u00e9vention chez les Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario sera d\u2019environ 1 160 $ par enfant : une augmentation d\u2019environ 560 $ par enfant par rapport au financement actuel.\n[83] Afin de fournir l\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate aux enfants en Ontario, les PCPI sugg\u00e8rent que les fonds soient distribu\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario ind\u00e9pendamment du consentement du gouvernement provincial. Les PCPI demandent aussi qu\u2019une date butoir soit fix\u00e9e pour la distribution de ces fonds. Selon COO, l\u2019organisme pr\u00e9voit actuellement des rencontres avec AANC et la province de l\u2019Ontario pour discuter de la fa\u00e7on dont le montant du financement inscrit au budget pour l\u2019Ontario a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et comment il peut \u00eatre distribu\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, il demande qu\u2019AANC fournisse de plus amples informations afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer la suffisance des fonds et des rapports en cours pour s\u2019assurer du respect de ses engagements.\n[84] Les PCPI soutiennent \u00e9galement que les investissements du budget 2016 ne tiennent pas compte de l\u2019inflation. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils demandent qu\u2019AANC verse une somme de 5 M$, ajust\u00e9e au taux compos\u00e9 de l\u2019inflation aux valeurs de 2012 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019indice des prix \u00e0 la consommation, \u00e0 \u00eatre divis\u00e9e entre les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN en Ontario.\n[85] AANC soutient qu\u2019il ne peut pas verser des fonds en Ontario par la voie de l\u2019Entente de 1965 sans le consentement de la province. En ce moment, l\u2019Ontario n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 de permettre le versement de fonds d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate par la voie de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Au contraire, selon AANC, l\u2019Ontario a propos\u00e9 que l\u2019on trouve une approche diff\u00e9rente pour cr\u00e9er une entente provisoire en dehors de l\u2019Entente de 1965 pour le versement des fonds d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate. AANC pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il travaille activement avec la province pour trouver un moyen de financer d\u00e8s que possible l\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate et qu\u2019il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 lancer imm\u00e9diatement le financement pour les services de pr\u00e9vention dans les r\u00e9serves pr\u00e9vu dans les engagements budg\u00e9taires de 2016. Toutefois, avant que toute option ne soit finalis\u00e9e, AANC cherchera l\u2019appui des dirigeants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Pendant que les travaux sur l\u2019allocation du financement des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates en Ontario sont en cours, AANC demande au Tribunal de ne pas imposer de date butoir, mais de plut\u00f4t permettre aux parties de travailler en collaboration pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me.\n[86] En ce qui concerne le montant additionnel pour l\u2019inflation, AANC soutient que ses investissements du budget 2016 rendent compte des facteurs de co\u00fbts et de la croissance annuelle, pour un investissement de 70,5 M$ sur cinq ans en financement de programmes suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les fournisseurs de service en Ontario.\n[87] La formation reconna\u00eet les investissements et l\u2019explication d\u2019AANC. Pendant que les travaux sur l\u2019allocation du financement des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates en Ontario sont en cours, le Tribunal n\u2019imposera pas de date butoir; il permettra plut\u00f4t aux parties de travailler en collaboration pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me. Cela \u00e9tant dit, ce probl\u00e8me devra \u00eatre abord\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement et non retard\u00e9 davantage. Toutefois, la formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 jour sur cette question de la part d\u2019AANC dans le cadre de son rapport de conformit\u00e9 et demande qu\u2019il divulgue la correspondance avec la province de l\u2019Ontario qu\u2019il a mentionn\u00e9e dans ses observations. Ce sujet sera \u00e9galement trait\u00e9 lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[88] Pour les m\u00eames raisons mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 55 ci-dessus, la formation a besoin de plus d\u2019information sur la demande de fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires pour contrer l\u2019inflation. Il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019inflation est un facteur cl\u00e9 qui a des r\u00e9percussions sur l\u2019ensemble des prestations de services et la capacit\u00e9 des organismes \u00e0 fournir ces m\u00eames services. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 311, 387 et 458. Toutefois, compte tenu du manque de renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur la d\u00e9termination du financement pour les futurs \u00ab facteurs de co\u00fbts et croissance annuelle \u00bb, la formation est incapable d\u2019\u00e9valuer si les investissements d\u2019AANC sont vraiment adapt\u00e9s aux besoins des organismes SEFPN de l\u2019Ontario. La formation ordonne AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9montrer clairement comment il a \u00e9tabli le financement en tenant compte des futurs \u00ab facteurs de co\u00fbts et croissance annuelle \u00bb; il examinera cette question lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nD. \u00c9largissement de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb\n[89] Les PCPI demandent une ordonnance pour que la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb de l\u2019Entente de 1965 soit \u00e9largie pour inclure les services de soutien et de r\u00e9adaptation pour besoins particuliers et les soins de r\u00e9pit. Les PCPI soutiennent que, si le soutien pour besoins particuliers et les soins de r\u00e9pit \u00e9taient offerts comme services de pr\u00e9vention, une r\u00e9duction du nombre des enfants pris en charge pourrait en r\u00e9sulter. Les familles n\u2019auront plus \u00e0 choisir entre garder leur famille unie et avoir un enfant dont les besoins particuliers n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s et qui ne re\u00e7oit aucun soutien, ou disloquer la famille en pla\u00e7ant un enfant pour qu\u2019il ait plus de chances d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services de soutien.\n[90] \u00c0 ce propos, les PCPI soutiennent que les enfants ayant des besoins particuliers courent un risque nettement sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la normale d\u2019\u00eatre retir\u00e9s de leur milieu familial en raison de leur incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer pour avoir acc\u00e8s aux soins et aux services dont ils ont besoin. Autrement dit, les enfants per\u00e7us comme \u00e9tant dans un cadre familial o\u00f9 on ne leur prodigue pas les soins requis peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme enfants ayant besoin de protection. Les d\u00e9placements effectu\u00e9s en vue d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux services pour besoins particuliers et aux \u00e9valuations ne sont pas financ\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Par cons\u00e9quent, les PCPI demandent que la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb, en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965, inclue le financement des d\u00e9placements effectu\u00e9s pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 tous les services de sant\u00e9 prescrits par un m\u00e9decin, y compris l\u2019\u00e9valuation des besoins particuliers et les services que ceux-ci n\u00e9cessitent.\n[91] Enfin, les PCPI demandent que la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb, en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965, soit \u00e9largie pour inclure l\u2019aide aux familles en situation de crise d\u00e9finie dans le Programme de bien-\u00eatre familial de l\u2019Ontario r\u00e9cemment annonc\u00e9; et que l\u2019engagement financier du Canada corresponde \u00e0 celui du gouvernement ontarien de 80 M$ sur trois ans, afin de servir les familles en situation de crise en vertu du Programme de bien-\u00eatre familial.\n[92] En r\u00e9ponse, AANC indique qu\u2019il se r\u00e9jouit de participer \u00e0 des discussions sur la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb de la province de l\u2019Ontario et s\u2019engage \u00e0 collaborer avec les autres partenaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, de m\u00eame qu\u2019avec l\u2019Ontario et les Premi\u00e8res Nations afin d\u2019examiner les mesures de soutien n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9duire ou pr\u00e9venir le placement des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Cependant, il affirme que la demande pour une ordonnance unilat\u00e9rale visant \u00e0 \u00e9largir la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965 n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9e. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, l\u2019Entente de 1965 a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et la province de l\u2019Ontario; toute modification \u00e0 cette Entente devra donc \u00eatre entreprise conjointement par les deux paliers de gouvernement.\n[93] COO propose que toute ordonnance pour une d\u00e9finition \u00e9largie de \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme durant la phase d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate afin de permettre la planification et la consultation avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les organismes charg\u00e9s du bien-\u00eatre des enfants ou les autres fournisseurs de services propos\u00e9s; et pour s\u2019assurer que le fournisseur de services appropri\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre trouv\u00e9, qu\u2019il ait le mandat n\u00e9cessaire, le d\u00e9sir et la capacit\u00e9 de fournir ces services.\n[94] La formation a fait des constatations dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des services vis\u00e9s par l\u2019Entente de 1965 et des difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par certains enfants et certaines familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es de l\u2019Ontario (voir les paragraphes 223 \u00e0 244). Toutefois, le P approuve la suggestion de COO, mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus, que l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb dans l\u2019Entente de 1965 soit \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 moyen ou \u00e0 long terme. Cela dit, dans le cadre des investissements d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate d\u2019AANC, lesquels sont provisoirement coordonn\u00e9s en dehors de l\u2019Entente de 1965, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9finition \u00e9largie des \u00ab services de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, AANC devrait envisager de rembourser les frais relatifs aux d\u00e9placements pour acc\u00e9der aux services et aux \u00e9valuations pour les besoins particuliers prescrits par un m\u00e9decin, les services de soutien et de r\u00e9adaptation pour les besoins particuliers, les soins de r\u00e9pit et le soutien aux familles en situation de crise. La formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e d\u2019AANC sur cette question et en discutera avec toutes les parties lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nE. R\u00e9tablir le partage des co\u00fbts des d\u00e9penses en capital\n[95] Les PCPI demandent une ordonnance pour qu\u2019AANC r\u00e9tablisse le partage des co\u00fbts des d\u00e9penses en capital en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965 \u00e0 la m\u00eame affectation de 90 %, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 4 de l\u2019Entente.\n[96] En r\u00e9ponse, AANC affirme qu\u2019il abordera la question plus large des besoins en infrastructures pour le Programme des SEFPN dans le cadre des efforts de r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme.\n[97] Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision, l\u2019Entente de 1965 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu de partage des d\u00e9penses en capital depuis 1975 et, en cons\u00e9quence, de nombreux organismes de SEFPN en Ontario n\u2019ont pas le financement pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019infrastructure n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la prestation des services obligatoires de protection \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (voir paragraphes 244 \u00e0 245). Par cons\u00e9quent, dans le cadre des investissements d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate d\u2019AANC, provisoirement coordonn\u00e9s en dehors de l\u2019Entente de 1965, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la question plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des besoins en infrastructure en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965 puisse \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement examin\u00e9e, AANC devrait \u00e9laborer une strat\u00e9gie provisoire pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins en infrastructure des organismes SEFPN. La formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e d\u2019AANC sur cette question et en d\u00e9battra avec toutes les parties lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence sur la gestion des cas en personne.\nF. Admissibilit\u00e9\n[98] Selon les PCPI, pour \u00eatre admissibles \u00e0 un financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu de la formule de partage des co\u00fbts de l\u2019Entente de 1965, les enfants et les jeunes doivent: 1) \u00eatre des Indiens inscrits; et, 2) r\u00e9sider sur une r\u00e9serve, sur des terres de la Couronne, ou hors r\u00e9serve pendant moins de 12 mois. Ils font valoir que cette exigence de r\u00e9sidence et de statut de l\u2019Entente de 1965 a un impact n\u00e9gatif important sur les enfants et les jeunes qui ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits, mais qui, pour diverses raisons, ne le sont pas. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les PCPI expliquent que les exigences en mati\u00e8re de documentation pour l\u2019inscription d\u2019un enfant \u00e0 la naissance ou encore jeune pr\u00e9sentent un d\u00e9fi de taille. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils demandent que les exigences en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9sidence et de statut de l\u2019Entente de 1965 soient modifi\u00e9es afin d\u2019assurer que non seulement les enfants et les jeunes qui sont inscrits soient admissibles aux services, mais aussi les enfants et les jeunes qui ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits.\n[99] Selon AANC, le lieu de r\u00e9sidence et le statut d\u2019Indien inscrit constituent un enjeu national qui n\u00e9cessitera l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une approche globale en collaboration avec des partenaires cl\u00e9s. AANC affirme qu\u2019il poursuivra les discussions sur cette question dans le cadre des efforts de r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme.\n[100] Bien que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965 n\u2019est pas abord\u00e9e en soi dans la d\u00e9cision, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un examen et d\u2019une mise \u00e0 jour de l\u2019Entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail (voir les exemples aux paragraphes 223 \u00e0 228). La formation convient qu\u2019une approche globale de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e en collaboration avec des partenaires cl\u00e9s, et qu\u2019il vaut mieux aborder la question \u00e0 long terme, lorsque l\u2019Entente de 1965 aura \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9form\u00e9e. Toutefois, dans le cadre des investissements d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate d\u2019AANC, provisoirement coordonn\u00e9s en dehors de l\u2019Entente de 1965, AANC devrait aussi envisager d\u2019aborder l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ont \u00ab le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits \u00bb. La formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e d\u2019AANC sur cette question et en d\u00e9battra avec toutes les parties lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nG. \u00c9tude sp\u00e9ciale\n[101] Les PCPI demandent qu\u2019une \u00e9tude sp\u00e9ciale sur l\u2019application de l\u2019Entente de 1965 en Ontario soit men\u00e9e d\u2019ici un an. L\u2019\u00e9tude serait men\u00e9e par des experts au moyen d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 avec l\u2019accord des parties et l\u2019apport d\u2019un financement permettant une participation importante des organismes fournissant des SEFPN, des gouvernements des Premi\u00e8res Nations, d\u2019AANC et de la province de l\u2019Ontario. Selon les PCPI, l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u00e9terminerait la pertinence de l\u2019Entente de 1965 dans l\u2019atteinte des objectifs suivants : la comparabilit\u00e9 des services; l\u2019adaptation culturelle des services qui tiennent compte des d\u00e9savantages historiques; et, l\u2019assurance que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant est primordial. \u00c0 terme, les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019\u00e9tude contribueraient \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme aux r\u00e9formes de l\u2019Entente de 1965.\n[102] La NNA est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019\u00e9tude propos\u00e9e, mais fait valoir qu\u2019elle devrait express\u00e9ment inclure un volet pour examiner et traiter de fa\u00e7on rigoureuse l\u2019effet de l\u2019Entente de 1965 sur les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord. En outre, elle soutient que l\u2019\u00e9tude devrait aussi inclure une importante collecte de donn\u00e9es, et que ces donn\u00e9es soient mises \u00e0 la disposition du public.\n[103] Comme la formation l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision, l\u2019Entente de 1965 n\u2019a jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen officiel d\u2019AANC. La formation convient avec les PCPI qu\u2019une telle \u00e9tude d\u00e9terminerait la pertinence de l\u2019Entente de 1965 dans l\u2019atteinte des objectifs suivants : la comparabilit\u00e9 des services offerts; la prestation de services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture qui tiennent compte des d\u00e9savantages historiques; et, l\u2019assurance que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant est primordial (voir la d\u00e9cision, aux paragraphes 223 \u00e0 227). Une \u00e9tude contribuerait \u00e9galement \u00e0 la r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme de l\u2019Entente de 1965 en d\u00e9finissant les mesures concr\u00e8tes qu\u2019AANC peut prendre pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination soulign\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Alors que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, AANC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il est ouvert \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019Entente de 1965, ses observations n\u2019ont pas particuli\u00e8rement trait\u00e9 de la demande des PCPI que soit tenue une \u00e9tude sp\u00e9ciale.\n[104] Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation ne prescrira aucune ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9tude sp\u00e9ciale en Ontario, tant qu\u2019AANC ne se sera pas prononc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise sur la question. La formation s\u2019attend \u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e d\u2019AANC sur cette question avant la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne o\u00f9 il poursuivra la discussion avec les parties.\nH. Fonds de pr\u00e9voyance unique\n[105] La NNA demande une ordonnance pour un fonds de pr\u00e9voyance unique afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les manques de fonds des organismes fournissant des services aux collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et du Nord. Selon la NNA, att\u00e9nuer les effets des dettes et d\u00e9ficits existants donnera davantage de souplesse \u00e0 ces organismes pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins directs, urgents et complexes des enfants et des familles dans leurs prestations de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es et du Nord.\n[106] Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9plique de la NNA; elle n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 comment\u00e9e par les autres parties. Cette demande fera partie des discussions de la prochaine rencontre en personne sur la gestion de dossiers.\nV. Le principe de Jordan\n[107] Dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition et la mise en \u0153uvre du Canada du principe de Jordan \u00e9taient restreintes et inad\u00e9quates, entra\u00eenant des lacunes en mati\u00e8re de services, des retards et des refus pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. En fait, les retards \u00e9taient inh\u00e9rents au processus de traitement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des cas potentiels vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan. On ignore pourquoi l\u2019approche du gouvernement pour les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e sur des conflits entre gouvernements concernant des enfants atteints de multiples d\u00e9ficiences, plut\u00f4t que sur des conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris entre minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral) impliquant tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (voir la d\u00e9cision, aux paragraphes 379 \u00e0 382 et 458).\n[108] Dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, la formation a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de consid\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement que le principe de Jordan concerne comme int\u00e9grants tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris les conflits entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux) et impliquant tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (pas seulement les enfants atteints de multiples d\u00e9ficiences). Il a ajout\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'esprit et \u00e0 l'objet du principe de Jordan, l'organisme gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier devrait payer le service sans devoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques ni tenir des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas avant qu'un financement soit fourni.\n[109] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, AANC a indiqu\u00e9 avoir pris les mesures suivantes afin d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance de la formation :\nA. AANC a \u00e9tendu le principe de Jordan pour qu\u2019il ne se limite plus aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves qui ont des d\u00e9ficiences multiples n\u00e9cessitant les soins de multiples fournisseurs de services;\nB. AANC a \u00e9tendu le principe de Jordan pour qu\u2019il s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence, y compris les conflits entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux;\nC. Les services pour tout cas vis\u00e9 par le principe de Jordan ne devront pas \u00eatre retard\u00e9s en raison de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas ou d\u2019examens des politiques;\nD. Des comit\u00e9s de travail comprenant des fonctionnaires, des directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et des sous-ministres adjoints de Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019AANC assureront la supervision et guideront la mise en \u0153uvre de la nouvelle application du principe de Jordan et offriront une fonction d\u2019appel.\n[110] Afin de mettre en \u0153uvre cette nouvelle approche au principe de Jordan, le Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il investirait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 382 millions de dollars en nouveaux fonds sur trois ans. Il s\u2019engagera \u00e9galement avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les provinces et le Yukon dans une strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 long terme pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Par ailleurs, le Canada a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9senterait un rapport annuel sur le principe de Jordan, comprenant le nombre de cas signal\u00e9s et le montant du financement accord\u00e9 pour r\u00e9soudre des cas pr\u00e9cis. AANC a \u00e9galement mis son site Web \u00e0 jour pour refl\u00e9ter les changements ci\u2011dessus, y compris l\u2019affichage de coordonn\u00e9es pour les personnes confront\u00e9es \u00e0 un cas vis\u00e9 par le principe de Jordan. En outre, il examine si des m\u00e9canismes hors des heures d\u2019ouverture doivent \u00eatre mis en place.\n[111] Pour aller de l\u2019avant, AANC soutient que la mobilisation sera un \u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 de sa nouvelle approche \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du principe de Jordan. AANC ajoute que Sant\u00e9 Canada et AANC ont communiqu\u00e9 conjointement par \u00e9crit avec les provinces et les territoires en vue d\u2019entamer des discussions relativement au principe de Jordan. Les dirigeants des Premi\u00e8res Nations participeront \u00e9galement \u00e0 la conception, \u00e0 la gestion et \u00e0 l\u2019application de la nouvelle approche du principe de Jordan de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 une r\u00e9forme \u00e0 long terme des politiques et du programme. En outre, les hauts fonctionnaires de Sant\u00e9 Canada et AANC s\u2019entretiendront avec l\u2019APN afin de discuter des prochaines \u00e9tapes et d\u2019\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019approche de \u00ab l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb. Parall\u00e8lement, les cadres des r\u00e9gions et de l\u2019administration centrale mobiliseront leurs partenaires des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e.\n[112] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de fournir des renseignements et des rapports suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019ordonnance et des engagements ci\u2011dessus. Ils ont sp\u00e9cifiquement demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n\u00b7 Des d\u00e9tails sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Canada pr\u00e9voit consulter les parties, les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN concernant l\u2019ensemble des questions relatives au principe de Jordan;\n\u00b7 Des d\u00e9tails sur les mesures prises par AANC pour se conformer \u00e0 la disposition de \u00ab l\u2019organisme qui est contact\u00e9 en premier \u00bb de l\u2019ordonnance;\n\u00b7 La confirmation qu\u2019AANC applique le principe de Jordan \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence;\n\u00b7 La confirmation qu\u2019AANC applique le principe de Jordan \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations;\n\u00b7 Des pr\u00e9cisions concernant le processus qui sera suivi pour g\u00e9rer les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan, l\u2019urgence des cas \u00e0 traiter et les mesures de reddition de compte et de transparence qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9es au processus pour assurer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance;\n\u00b7 Des pr\u00e9cisions sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Canada compte s\u2019assurer que les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN fassent partie du processus de consultation avec les provinces et les territoires et qu\u2019ils soient impliqu\u00e9s dans les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan.\n[113] Les PCPI ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC publie et tienne \u00e0 jour les renseignements concernant la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan, notamment sa d\u00e9finition, son processus et ses crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation, ainsi que ses m\u00e9canismes de recours et d\u2019appel. En outre, les PCPI demandent qu\u2019AANC affiche annuellement des donn\u00e9es non identificatoires sur le nombre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au principe de Jordan effectu\u00e9es, le r\u00e8glement de ces cas, le d\u00e9lai de r\u00e8glement, de m\u00eame que le r\u00e9sultat des appels ind\u00e9pendants. Enfin, les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC fournisse \u00e0 toutes les Premi\u00e8res Nations et aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN les noms et les coordonn\u00e9es des responsables de chaque r\u00e9gion et qu\u2019il informe les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN de toute modification \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[114] La formation est heureux des changements et des investissements rapport\u00e9s par le Canada pour concr\u00e9tiser toute la signification et la port\u00e9e du principe de Jordan, mais partage plusieurs des pr\u00e9occupations des PCPI concernant la consultation et la mise en \u0153uvre du principe. D\u2019abord, il serait utile pour la formation et pour les autres parties qu\u2019AANC fournisse une liste des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN, des autorit\u00e9s provinciales et territoriales, des partenaires, des experts ou de toute autre personne qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant au sujet du principe de Jordan, ainsi que son plan de consultation pour le futur. La liste de toute consultation ant\u00e9rieure de janvier \u00e0 septembre 2016 devrait comprendre un ordre du jour et un compte rendu des discussions.\n[115] AANC a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un document d\u2019orientation provisoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis aux points de contact r\u00e9gionaux pour le principe de Jordan afin d\u2019orienter le personnel r\u00e9gional de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab assurer que les services essentiels aux enfants ne soient pas retard\u00e9s en raison de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas ou d\u2019examens de politiques \u00bb. Toutefois, les observations du Canada sont impr\u00e9cises en ce qui concerne le processus de suivi pour les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan. Les observations du Canada sont les suivantes :\n\u00b7 Sant\u00e9 Canada et AANC fourniront des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 leur personnel pour initier la mise en \u0153uvre de cette approche et appuieront le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends ou des lacunes en mati\u00e8re de services au cours des trois prochaines ann\u00e9es en se basant sur des normes normatives provinciales;\n\u00b7 Les hauts fonctionnaires collaboreront avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale et r\u00e9gionale pour planifier l\u2019\u00e9laboration et la mise en \u0153uvre de la fonction de coordination des services et pour mettre au point une approche efficace pour l\u2019organisation des services offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations ayant des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 qui vivent dans des r\u00e9serves.\n\u00b7 Une gestion suppl\u00e9mentaire de ces cas sera effectu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 assurer que la mise en \u0153uvre du service ou de la gamme de services appropri\u00e9s soit faite en temps opportun;\n\u00b7 Des formations et des orientations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la nouvelle d\u00e9finition et la port\u00e9e \u00e9tendue du principe de Jordan commenceront imm\u00e9diatement pour les points de contact;\n\u00b7 Une structure de gouvernance sera \u00e9tablie pour traiter les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan lorsqu\u2019ils surviennent;\n\u00b7 Les appels seront entendus rapidement pour assurer que les enfants ayant des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 obtiennent des services en temps opportun.\n[116] Pour ce qui est des observations d\u2019AANC susmentionn\u00e9es, la formation n\u2019est pas s\u00fbr de comprendre quel est le processus actuel de suivi des cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan et qui sont les gens impliqu\u00e9s dans le traitement de ces cas (personnel de l\u2019AANC, travailleurs sociaux, professionnels de la sant\u00e9, etc.). La formation demande \u00e0 AANC:\n\u00b7 De fournir des d\u00e9tails au sujet des mesures entreprises par AANC pour se conformer \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019ordonnance de \u00ab l'organisme gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier\u00bb.\n\u00b7 De fournir des pr\u00e9cisions en ce qui concerne le processus qui sera suivi pour les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan, comment les cas urgents recevront l\u2019attention voulue, et quelles mesures de responsabilit\u00e9 et de transparence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9es \u00e0 ce processus pour assurer sa conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance;\n\u00b7 De fournir des pr\u00e9cisions sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Canada s\u2019assurera que les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN et les PCPI fassent partie du processus de consultation avec les provinces et les territoires et qu\u2019ils soient impliqu\u00e9s dans les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan;\n\u00b7 De fournir \u00e0 toutes les Premi\u00e8res Nations et aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN les noms et les coordonn\u00e9es des points de contact de chaque r\u00e9gion pour le principe de Jordan et informer les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN en question de toute modification \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[117] En ce qui concerne la port\u00e9e de la nouvelle formulation du principe de Jordan d\u2019AANC, la formation mentionne que la motion adopt\u00e9e unanimement par la Chambre des communes ne limitait pas l\u2019application du principe aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, mais \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations : \u00ab le gouvernement devrait imm\u00e9diatement adopter le principe de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le principe de Jordan, afin de r\u00e9soudre les conflits de comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (voir d\u00e9cision, au paragraphe 353, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). La formulation du principe de Jordan d\u2019AANC n\u2019est pas conforme aux exigences d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de son propre Programme des SEFPN, qui s\u2019applique aux Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00ab des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve \u00bb (voir les articles 1.3.2 et 1.3.7 du Manuel national des programmes sociaux du SEFPN 2015 et l\u2019article 1.1 du Manuel national des programmes sociaux 2012 aux para 52-53 de la d\u00e9cision). Ainsi, l\u2019application du principe de Jordan uniquement aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves est plus limit\u00e9e que la d\u00e9finition du Programme des SEFPN d\u2019AANC. Ce type de restriction entra\u00eenera des lacunes en mati\u00e8re de services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et ne correspond pas avec la d\u00e9cision (voir paragraphes 362, 364 \u00e0 382 et 391).\n[118] La formation souligne que, en r\u00e9ponse aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision sur le principe de Jordan, la justification d\u2019AANC pour sa nouvelle formulation du principe faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux paragraphes de la d\u00e9cision (voir \u00ab Respondent\u2019s Further Reply Submissions Re Immediate Relief \u00bb, Justice Canada, 6 juillet 2016, aux p. 22-23), qui en faisaient une interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite en indiquant que le principe de Jordan ne devrait s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves. Cette sorte d\u2019analyse \u00e9troite est d\u00e9conseill\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle peut entra\u00eener de la discrimination, telle qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la motion adopt\u00e9e unanimement par la Chambre des communes, la formation ordonne \u00e0 AANC d\u2019appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, pas seulement \u00e0 ceux vivant dans des r\u00e9serves.\n[119] La nouvelle formulation du principe de Jordan d\u2019AANC semble \u00e9galement limiter son application aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations [traduction] \u00ab atteints de probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale. \u00bb Sans renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires, cette formulation du principe de Jordan semble encore une fois \u00eatre plus restrictive que celle formul\u00e9e par la Chambre des communes. La formation exige qu\u2019AANC fournisse, dans son rapport de conformit\u00e9, l\u2019explication de sa formulation de la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9valuer pleinement son impact. Cela fera aussi partie des discussions lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\n[120] Finalement, la formation conclut qu\u2019AANC a confirm\u00e9 que le principe de Jordan est appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence. La formation \u00e9valuera cette application au moyen de rapports de suivi.\nVI. Autres ordonnances demand\u00e9es\nA. Aucune r\u00e9duction de financement\n[121] Les PCPI demandent qu\u2019on ordonne \u00e0 AANC de ne pas r\u00e9duire ni limiter davantage le financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ou des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations couverts par le principe de Jordan.\n[122] AANC a accept\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9duire ni limiter davantage le financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance couverts par le principe de Jordan.\n[123] La formation reconna\u00eet l\u2019engagement d\u2019AANC susmentionn\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grera dans son ordonnance ci-dessous.\nB. L\u2019adoption du principe selon lequel les enfants et les jeunes vivant en \u00e9tablissements de soins doivent habiter le plus pr\u00e8s possible de leurs communaut\u00e9s natales\n[124] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 une ordonnance pour que le Canada adopte le principe selon lequel les enfants et les jeunes vivant en \u00e9tablissement de soins doivent habiter le plus pr\u00e8s possible de leurs communaut\u00e9s natales et que le financement et les ressources n\u00e9cessaires soient fournis pour assurer le respect de ce principe fondamental.\n[125] AANC estime que la d\u00e9cision de confier un enfant \u00e0 un service de sant\u00e9 est \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du fournisseur du service. Toutefois, dans le cadre de la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN, AANC affirme vouloir solliciter la participation des fournisseurs de services, des provinces et des territoires et tout autre partenaire utile, y compris les dirigeants et les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, pour permettre aux enfants plac\u00e9s pour des soins en dehors de leur communaut\u00e9 de maintenir un lien avec leur communaut\u00e9 et leur culture.\n[126] Cette demande fera partie de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas en personne.\nC. Comit\u00e9 consultatif national\n[127] AANC s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir le CCN, et des discussions avec l\u2019APN et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien sur la formation du comit\u00e9 sont en cours.\n[128] La NNA a demand\u00e9 une ordonnance pour qu\u2019elle soit repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au CCN et aux tables rondes r\u00e9gionales. De plus, la NNA a demand\u00e9 que le CCN int\u00e8gre un sous-comit\u00e9 des r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es du nord dans lequel la NNA serait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Par ailleurs, si la formation conclut que la proposition de la NNA est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, elle demande qu\u2019une date limite ou un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier soit \u00e9tabli, que les sous-comit\u00e9s, le CCN et les tables rondes r\u00e9gionales devront respecter.\n[129] AANC appuie la proposition de la NNA qu\u2019un sous-comit\u00e9 des r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord collabore avec le CCN et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il aborderait la question avec le comit\u00e9.\n[130] L\u2019APN soutient qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer le CCN ou sa composition \u00e0 une ordonnance. Les parties voient le CCN comme \u00e9tant un m\u00e9canisme visant les r\u00e9formes du Programme des SEFPN \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme, et les parties s\u2019emploient actuellement \u00e0 apporter une aide imm\u00e9diate.\n[131] La formation se penchera sur cette question lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nD. L\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence des cas de violence et de n\u00e9gligence envers les enfants\n[132] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu de financer imm\u00e9diatement une nouvelle version de l\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence des cas de violence et de n\u00e9gligence envers les enfants, y compris une collecte de donn\u00e9es sp\u00e9cifiques sur les communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e9loign\u00e9es.\n[133] Selon AANC, un processus auquel participe l\u2019Agence de la sant\u00e9 publique du Canada est en cours pour financer le volet autochtone de l\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence.\n[134] La formation est d\u2019avis qu\u2019une nouvelle version de l\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence serait un outil utile pour \u00e9tayer davantage la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN et l\u2019Entente de 1965. La formation a aussi reconnu la volont\u00e9 d\u2019AANC de financer le volet autochtone de l\u2019\u00e9tude, tel que mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus. Le Tribunal s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019AANC indique dans son rapport si un financement pour le volet autochtone de l\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence sera octroy\u00e9, et si ce volet de l\u2019\u00e9tude inclura la collecte de donn\u00e9es sp\u00e9cifiques aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord.\nE. Mise \u00e0 jour des politiques, des proc\u00e9dures et des ententes\n[135] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu de mettre \u00e0 jour ses politiques, ses proc\u00e9dures (y compris les proc\u00e9dures de compte rendu des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN) et les ententes de contribution pour se conformer avec l\u2019ordonnance de la formation et communiquer en d\u00e9tail et par \u00e9crit ces r\u00e9formes aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN et au public.\n[136] Selon AANC, la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN comprendra une refonte de ses mod\u00e8les de financement, de ses politiques et de ses proc\u00e9dures. Toutefois, ce genre de travail n\u00e9cessite une analyse en profondeur et une collaboration avec tous les partenaires cl\u00e9s pertinents, il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un processus de longue haleine. Entre-temps, AANC a soutenu qu\u2019utiliser les m\u00e9canismes de financement et les proc\u00e9dures actuels permettra d\u2019assurer que les enfants et les familles re\u00e7oivent toujours leurs services et pr\u00e9viendra leur interruption. AANC affirme vouloir collaborer avec ses partenaires pour mettre \u00e0 jour et ajuster au besoin les processus pour le prochain exercice financier.\n[137] Selon la formation, la demande de mise \u00e0 jour des politiques, des proc\u00e9dures et des ententes est vis\u00e9e par son ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019effectuer une r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN et de l\u2019Entente de 1965, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision. Par souci de clart\u00e9, la formation ordonne \u00e0 AANC de mettre \u00e0 jour ses politiques, ses proc\u00e9dures et ses ententes pour se conformer aux conclusions du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision. La formation est conscient que cette r\u00e9forme sera men\u00e9e \u00e0 plus long terme, et que certaines mesures provisoires seront mises en place entre-temps, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 dans la cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019importance centrale de cette question et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mettre en place un processus et des mesures provisoires, cette demande fera \u00e9galement partie de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nF. Formation et param\u00e8tres de rendement des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux\n[138] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu d\u2019assurer que ses fonctionnaires et son personnel re\u00e7oivent une formation obligatoire de 15 heures sur : le rapport final de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9conciliation (d\u00e9cembre 2015); le Programme des SEFPN (y compris l\u2019\u00e9laboration de mod\u00e8les, les hypoth\u00e8ses et la revue des programmes); la d\u00e9cision et la pleine signification et port\u00e9e du principe de Jordan. La formation devrait se tenir avant le 31 ao\u00fbt 2016 et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re approuv\u00e9e par la Commission et les plaignantes.\n[139] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, les PCPI ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuations de rendement annuelles des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui fournissent des services aux peuples autochtones, ou qui attribuent des t\u00e2ches connexes, comprennent des param\u00e8tres con\u00e7us pour d\u00e9montrer comment chaque personne a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 refermer l\u2019\u00e9cart socio-\u00e9conomique avec les peuples autochtones. Elles demandent \u00e9galement au Canada d\u2019\u00e9laborer un programme obligatoire de comp\u00e9tences transculturelles pour ces employ\u00e9s.\n[140] En r\u00e9ponse, AANC a indiqu\u00e9 attendre avec int\u00e9r\u00eat les discussions suppl\u00e9mentaires sur l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la sensibilit\u00e9 culturelle de ses employ\u00e9s. Toutefois, AANC affirme que la demande voulant que le personnel suive une formation sp\u00e9cifique va au\u2011del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e de la plainte et que l\u2019exigence que tous les employ\u00e9s soient form\u00e9s constitue une mesure trop large. En fait, AANC soutient que les \u00e9valuations de rendement de fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux sp\u00e9cifiques n\u2019\u00e9taient pas vis\u00e9es par la plainte, qui ne comptait pas non plus d\u2019all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre des employ\u00e9s en particulier. Selon AANC, la demande d\u2019\u00e9tablissement de param\u00e8tres de rendement va au-del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e de la plainte, y compris l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de programmes obligatoires qui y seraient li\u00e9s.\n[141] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 poursuivre les discussions sur la question, la formation abordera cet enjeu \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nG. Financement du R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones\n[142] Les audiences sur la question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es et diffus\u00e9es par l\u2019Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) (le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones) conform\u00e9ment aux directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution pour la couverture approuv\u00e9es par la formation (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 18; et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 23). Une de ces directives exigeait qu\u2019APTN conserve les enregistrements de l\u2019audience pendant trois ans.\n[143] Puisque la p\u00e9riode de trois ans tire bient\u00f4t \u00e0 sa fin, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019importance juridique, sociale, morale et politique de ce cas, les PCPI demandent qu\u2019AANC verse 30 000 $ \u00e0 APTN pour transf\u00e9rer les enregistrements des audiences du Tribunal en un format accessible au public et fournisse le financement n\u00e9cessaire au Centre national pour la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9conciliation pour entreposer les enregistrements et g\u00e9rer leur acc\u00e8s au public.\n[144] En r\u00e9ponse, AANC soutient qu\u2019APTN n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la plainte et, ainsi, le Tribunal ne devrait pas lui accorder de mesure de redressement. Toutefois, AANC se dit dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cette proposition en consid\u00e9ration.\n[145] La formation appuie le travail et la mission d\u2019APTN. Il \u00e9tait ravi de constater sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement des audiences dans ce cas. Toutefois, la formation ne rendra pas l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e. Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder une mesure de redressement du Tribunal doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en fonction des principes, consid\u00e9rant le lien entre les pratiques discriminatoires et le pr\u00e9judice invoqu\u00e9. (voir Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268 (CanLII), au paragraphe 37). APTN n\u2019est ni une partie \u00e0 la plainte ni une victime des pratiques discriminatoires en question. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait aucun doute sur l\u2019importance juridique, sociale, morale et politique que rev\u00eat la diffusion publique, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 aux conclusions de discrimination.\n[146] Bien que la formation ne rende pas l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e, il souligne qu\u2019AANC est favorable au financement du transfert des enregistrements. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la grande importance des enregistrements et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public, la formation encourage AANC \u00e0 le faire.\nH. Examen des d\u00e9cisions relatives au financement de nouveaux organismes\n[147] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu d\u2019examiner les d\u00e9cisions de refuser le financement pour appuyer le d\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019exploitation des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN, notamment en ce qui concerne les demandes pour de nouveaux organismes par l\u2019Alliance de la Nation Okanagan et la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Carcross.\n[148] AANC estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un sujet important \u00e0 r\u00e9gler avec la participation des partenaires sur la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les autorit\u00e9s l\u00e9gislatives des provinces et territoires, cela n\u00e9cessitera l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une entente avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, ainsi qu\u2019avec les partenaires de Premi\u00e8res Nations, et une participation de leur part.\n[149] Avant d\u2019envisager une ordonnance, la formation estime que cette demande pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des discussions suppl\u00e9mentaires dans le cadre de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nI. Financement de la recherche, de bourses d\u2019\u00e9tude et de conf\u00e9rences\n[150] Les PCPI ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu, pendant au moins 10 ans, de financer pleinement la recherche et les bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes portant sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la prestation des services d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, de m\u00eame que sur les questions comme le contr\u00f4le et l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation, la revitalisation des ordonnances juridiques autochtones, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie et le contr\u00f4le des terres et des ressources. De plus, elles soutiennent qu\u2019un tel financement pour la recherche et les bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes devrait \u00eatre administr\u00e9 par un organisme universitaire de surveillance ind\u00e9pendant. Les PCPI ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de financer des conf\u00e9rences annuelles pour la pr\u00e9sentation des conclusions des recherches susmentionn\u00e9es et que les fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux impliqu\u00e9s dans la prestation de services aux peuples autochtones soient tenus d\u2019y assister.\n[151] Bien qu\u2019AANC soit ouvert \u00e0 discuter davantage de l\u2019appui \u00e0 la recherche, il affirme que cette demande pr\u00e9cise d\u00e9passe le cadre du Programme des SEFPN.\n[152] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 en discuter davantage, cette demande sera int\u00e9gr\u00e9e \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne.\nJ. Nomination de la Commission pour rallier l\u2019ensemble des parties et cr\u00e9er une \u00e9bauche d\u2019ordonnance\n[153] L\u2019APN a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019AANC soit tenu de participer \u00e0 des consultations avec la Commission sur les mesures imm\u00e9diates pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination soulign\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision. L'Assembl\u00e9e demande que la Commission soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour rallier toutes les parties dans une discussion sur l\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate et par la suite cr\u00e9er une \u00e9bauche d\u2019ordonnance comprenant les dates pr\u00e9cises de mise en \u0153uvre de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate d\u2019AANC. La Commission serait alors tenue de soumettre l\u2019\u00e9bauche d\u2019ordonnance, approuv\u00e9e par toutes les parties, dans les 60 jours suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[154] Par ailleurs, l\u2019APN affirme que la formation devrait ordonner \u00e0 AANC, ou presser la Commission, de se pencher sur la question d\u2019affectation des ressources aux parties pour assurer leur participation significative au processus.\n[155] L\u2019AANC affirme avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vu plusieurs mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate, notamment en fournissant un financement accru aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le de financement mis \u00e0 jour et am\u00e9lior\u00e9. AANC souhaite progresser en s\u2019attaquant aux r\u00e9formes \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme avec la participation des partenaires cl\u00e9s. Selon AANC, l\u2019ensemble du travail \u00e0 effectuer pour r\u00e9former le Programme des SEFPN n\u00e9cessitera la participation de partenaires cl\u00e9s tels que les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN, les communaut\u00e9s et les dirigeants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les provinces, le territoire du Yukon et les parties \u00e0 la plainte.\n[156] La demande d\u2019APN ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise en r\u00e9plique et les PCPI n\u2019avaient pas la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande pourrait s\u2019inscrire dans les discussions de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne. AANC a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 pouvoir fournir les fonds pour la participation des PCPI aux r\u00e9unions. Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation aimerait savoir si AANC consent \u00e0 accorder les fonds pour la participation des PCPI \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion des cas en personne et \u00e0 toutes les conf\u00e9rences subs\u00e9quentes.\nVII. Ordonnance\n[157] Dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de cesser ses pratiques discriminatoires et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN et de l\u2019Entente de 1965 pour refl\u00e9ter les conclusions de la formation, de m\u00eame que de cesser d\u2019appliquer sa d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre imm\u00e9diatement des mesures pour pleinement mettre en \u0153uvre le sens et la port\u00e9e de ce principe (voir paragraphe 481). Tel que mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, la demande des PCPI de mettre \u00e0 jour les politiques, les proc\u00e9dures et les ententes est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par cette ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN et de l\u2019Entente de 1965, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de la formation dans la d\u00e9cision. Autrement dit, la formation ordonne \u00e0 AANC de mettre \u00e0 jour ses politiques, ses proc\u00e9dures et ses ententes pour se conformer aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision.\n[158] En outre, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 court terme, la formation a ensuite ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de prendre des mesures imm\u00e9diates pour r\u00e9gler plusieurs points. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10 et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ces points devaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement. Encore une fois, ces points comprennent : le traitement des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9fastes li\u00e9es aux hypoth\u00e8ses sur le nombre d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s, les familles n\u00e9cessitant des services et les niveaux de population; les petits organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN ou ceux qui sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s; le co\u00fbt de la vie et l\u2019inflation; l\u2019\u00e9volution des normes sur les services; les salaires et les avantages; la formation; les frais juridiques; les primes d\u2019assurance; les d\u00e9placements; les \u00e9tablissements multiples; les immobilisations; les programmes et les services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture et les mesures moins perturbatrices. AANC a re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre de faire rapport \u00e0 la formation pour expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on ces points seront trait\u00e9s \u00e0 court terme pour apporter une aide imm\u00e9diate aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves (voir 2016 TCDP 10, aux paragraphes 20 et 23).\n[159] AANC a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 enjointe de consid\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan comme int\u00e9grant tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris les conflits entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux) et tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (pas seulement les enfants qui ont de multiples d\u00e9ficiences). Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019objectif et \u00e0 l\u2019intention du principe de Jordan, la formation a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que l'organisme gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier devrait payer le service sans devoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques ni tenir des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas avant qu'un financement soit fourni (voir 2016 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 33).\n[160] Outre les ordonnances dans la d\u00e9cision et dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ci-dessus, la formation ordonne ce qui suit :\nA. Mesures imm\u00e9diates suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 prendre\n1. AANC ne peut diminuer ni limiter davantage le financement accord\u00e9 aux Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance couverts par le principe de Jordan. (voir les paragraphes 121 \u00e0 123 ci-dessus).\n2. AANC d\u00e9terminera le budget de chaque organisme qui fournissent des SEFPN en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de ses circonstances et de ses besoins particuliers, notamment une \u00e9valuation appropri\u00e9e sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019\u00e9loignement peut affecter la capacit\u00e9 des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN \u00e0 offrir des services (voir les paragraphes 33, 37, 40 et 47 ci-dessus);\n3. Pour d\u00e9terminer le financement pour les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN, AANC doit \u00e9tablir les hypoth\u00e8ses, seulement en tant que norme minimale, voulant que 6 % des enfants soient pris en charge et que 20 % des familles aient besoin de services. AANC ne r\u00e9duira pas le financement accord\u00e9 aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN si le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge est de moins de 6 % ou si le nombre de familles ayant besoin de services est de moins de 20 % (voir paragraphe 38 ci-dessus);\n4. Pour d\u00e9terminer le financement \u00e0 accorder aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN ayant plus de 6 % d\u2019enfants pris en charge ou plus de 20 % de familles, AANC est tenu d\u2019\u00e9tablir le financement pour ces organismes selon l\u2019\u00e9valuation du nombre actuel d\u2019enfants pris en charge et de familles ayant besoin de services (voir paragraphe 39 ci-dessus);\n5. Pour d\u00e9terminer le financement accord\u00e9 aux organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN, AANC doit cesser de r\u00e9duire le financement aux organismes qui desservent moins d\u2019enfants que les 251 admissibles. Le financement devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre \u00e9tabli selon une \u00e9valuation du niveau de besoin actuel de services pour chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN, ind\u00e9pendamment du niveau de la population (voir paragraphe 40 ci-dessus);\n6. AANC cessera la pratique obligeant les organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9passements de co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entretien en puisant dans le financement des volets de l\u2019exploitation et de la pr\u00e9vention (voir paragraphes 56 \u00e0 61 ci-dessus);\n7. AANC doit appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (pas seulement ceux qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves) (voir paragraphes 117 \u00e0 118 ci-dessus).\nB. Rapports\n1. AANC fournira un rapport de conformit\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 d\u2019ici le 31 octobre 2016 dans lequel il pr\u00e9cisera :\na.

La fa\u00e7on dont il compte s\u2019attaquer d\u00e8s maintenant \u00e0 la question des frais de r\u00e9paration des b\u00e2timents, lorsque l\u2019organisme qui fournit des SEFPN a re\u00e7u un avis \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les r\u00e9parations doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux codes et r\u00e8glements sur la construction, les incendies et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 applicables, ou lorsqu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres preuves de non\u2011conformit\u00e9 aux codes et r\u00e8glements sur la construction, les incendies et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 applicables (voir paragraphe 49 ci-dessus);\nd. La fa\u00e7on dont il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN pour le rachat de services ant\u00e9rieurs aux enfants et la r\u00e9ception, l\u2019\u00e9valuation et l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les rapports de la protection de l\u2019enfance (voir paragraphe 50 ci-dessus);\ne. Le montant de fonds qu\u2019il accorde \u00e0 chaque \u00ab facteur de co\u00fbts futurs et croissants \u00bb et la fa\u00e7on dont il est parvenu aux allocations correspondantes pour chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN, y compris pour l\u2019Ontario (voir paragraphes 51 \u00e0 55 ci-dessus);\nf. La fa\u00e7on dont le nouveau financement s\u2019attaque d\u00e8s maintenant aux effets n\u00e9gatifs soulev\u00e9s de l\u2019Entente de 1965, plus particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait aux services de sant\u00e9 mentale et aux repr\u00e9sentants de bandes (voir paragraphes 69 \u00e0 74 ci-dessus);\ng. La fa\u00e7on dont il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque organisme fournissant des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins actuels des communaut\u00e9s qu\u2019ils desservent, en prenant en consid\u00e9ration des facteurs comme les d\u00e9placements pour donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services, le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la vie, la prestation de services dans les communaut\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et la capacit\u00e9 des organismes qui fournissent des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e d\u2019embaucher et de conserver leur personnel (voir paragraphes 75 \u00e0 81 ci-dessus);\nh. La fa\u00e7on dont les fonds d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate sont distribu\u00e9s en Ontario (voir paragraphes 82 \u00e0 88 ci-dessus);\ni. La fa\u00e7on dont il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 aux mesures imm\u00e9diates ordonn\u00e9es pour mettre en \u0153uvre la pleine port\u00e9e et signification du principe de Jordan (voir paragraphes 107 \u00e0 120 ci-dessus), notamment :\ni. la confirmation qu\u2019il applique le principe \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (pas seulement \u00e0 ceux qui vivent sur les r\u00e9serves);\nii. une explication de la raison pour laquelle la nouvelle formulation du principe de Jordan s\u2019applique aux enfants [traduction] \u00ab atteints de probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale. \u00bb\niii. des d\u00e9tails sur les mesures qu\u2019il a prises pour se conformer \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du \u00ab minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier \u00bb;\niv. des pr\u00e9cisions concernant le processus qui sera suivi pour administrer les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan, l\u2019urgence des cas \u00e0 traiter et les mesures d\u2019imputabilit\u00e9 et de transparence qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9es au processus pour assurer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance;\nv. des pr\u00e9cisions sur la fa\u00e7on dont elle il compte s\u2019assurer que les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les PCPI et les organismes fournissant des SEFPN fassent partie du processus de consultation avec les provinces et les territoires et qu\u2019ils soient impliqu\u00e9s dans les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan;\nvi. fournir \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des Premi\u00e8res Nations et aux organismes fournissant des SEFPN les noms et les coordonn\u00e9es des points de contact de chaque r\u00e9gion et les informer de toute modification \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard;\nj. S\u2019il fournit un financement pour le volet autochtone de l\u2019\u00e9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence, et si ce volet de l\u2019\u00e9tude comprend la collecte de donn\u00e9es sp\u00e9cifiques aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e9loign\u00e9es du nord (voir paragraphes 132 \u00e0 134 ci-dessus).\nC. Renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 fournir\n1. D\u2019ici le 30 septembre 2016, AANC doit avoir signifi\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 :\nLa justification, les donn\u00e9es et autres renseignements pertinents qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir son plan de cinq ans d\u2019investissement dans le Programme des SEFPN et pour d\u00e9terminer les budgets pour chaque organisme qui fournit des SEFPN, y compris son \u00e9tude sur les facteurs de co\u00fbts et la documentation sur l\u2019analyse des tendances, la fa\u00e7on dont il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 des pr\u00e9visions financi\u00e8res au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019exercice 2016\u20112017, des mesures prises pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 des salaires du personnel et les avantages sociaux aux taux provinciaux, les renseignements utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer le ratio du nombre de cas au Qu\u00e9bec et au Manitoba et, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la fa\u00e7on dont elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la valeur des services d\u2019urgence hors des heures d\u2019ouverture, le d\u00e9placement du personnel, les organismes de v\u00e9rification, les services juridiques et les assurances;\nLa correspondance avec l\u2019Ontario vis\u00e9e dans ses observations (voir paragraphes 85 \u00e0 87).\n2.

Le contexte\n[1] Le plaignant soutient que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) n\u2019avait aucun pouvoir de restreindre l\u2019\u00e9valuation de novo du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) concernant le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission a conclu qu\u2019il existait des motifs suffisants pour renvoyer les plaintes au Tribunal pour instruction, l\u2019instruction ne devrait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 une seule question.\n[2] Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (les intim\u00e9es) soutiennent que la Commission a express\u00e9ment renvoy\u00e9 une seule all\u00e9gation au Tribunal; \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les intim\u00e9es se fondent sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, dat\u00e9e du 4 novembre 2015, dont il ressort que :\n[traduction]\nLa Commission accepte la conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur selon laquelle la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une distinction fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article L75.07 de la lettre d\u2019entente no 75.

De plus, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission, aux termes du paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP ou la Loi), en ce qui concerne le rejet ou le renvoi d\u2019une plainte. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire exerc\u00e9 par elle-m\u00eame est la voie qu\u2019il convient de suivre pour contester une d\u00e9cision de la Commission touchant une telle question.

Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2014 CAF 18).\n[4] La port\u00e9e du renvoi est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la lettre que la Commission envoie au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, car il s\u2019agit du document qui met en branle tout le processus d\u2019instruction du Tribunal. Cette lettre permet donc d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 ou non. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut examiner s\u2019il existe un libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis limitant la port\u00e9e de la plainte ou s\u2019il y a renvoi de la plainte dans sa totalit\u00e9. (Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 32 (Kanagasabapathy)).\nC. Analyse et d\u00e9cision\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la preuve et d\u2019entendre les arguments portant uniquement sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019article L75.07 de la lettre d\u2019entente no 75 \u00e9tabli une distinction fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Le Tribunal fonde sa d\u00e9cision sur la lettre de la Commission adress\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal et dat\u00e9e du 12 novembre 2015 :\n[traduction]\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu du paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte relative \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019article L75.07 de la lettre d\u2019entente no 75 \u00e9tabli une distinction fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, car la Commission est convaincue, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, qu\u2019une instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n[6] La lettre de la Commission contient une restriction qui limite la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation pr\u00e9cise de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article L75.07 de la lettre d\u2019entente no 75.\n[7] Les intim\u00e9es se fondent sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22, dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019une lettre de la Commission adress\u00e9e aux parties et intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00bb limitait la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction. Toutefois, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy, l\u2019approche du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 TCDP 32, qui consiste \u00e0 se fonder sur le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9terminant de la lettre adress\u00e9e par la Commission au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal. Agir autrement signifierait que le Tribunal va au\u2011del\u00e0 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et exerce un pouvoir de surveillance sur les faits et gestes de la Commission et ses d\u00e9cisions, ce qui est exclusivement du ressort de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[8] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 4 novembre 2015, sur laquelle se fondaient les intim\u00e9es. Toutefois, en raison des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 4 novembre 2015 est d\u00e9terminante de la port\u00e9e du renvoi au Tribunal.\n[9] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que les paragraphes 8, 9, 10, 11, 17B question no 1,18 et 20 se situent hors de la port\u00e9e de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi. Compte tenu de cette \u00e9valuation, le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019avis des intim\u00e9es.\nII. T\u00e9moin expert et rapport\nA. Le contexte\n[10] Le plaignant a fourni son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et la liste des t\u00e9moins, laquelle n\u2019inclut ni le nom du t\u00e9moin expert ni un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage attendu. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas non plus inclus le nom du pilote d\u2019Air Canada ou de l\u2019ancien pilote d\u2019Air Canada qui t\u00e9moignerait des incidences d\u00e9favorables de la perte des prestations du R\u00e9gime collectif d\u2019assurance invalidit\u00e9 (le R\u00e9gime).\n[11] Selon le plaignant, le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles) exige uniquement qu\u2019un rapport pour chaque t\u00e9moin expert soit signifi\u00e9 \u00ab dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur \u00bb, et cette exigence n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie.\n[12] Les intim\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas encore fourni leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, car elles attendent des renseignements du plaignant. Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que le plaignant doit d\u2019abord leur donner signification du nom du t\u00e9moin expert et du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de celui-ci avec l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, parce que [traduction] \u00ab conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 exig\u00e9 que le plaignant fournisse de tels renseignements pr\u00e9cis dans sa directive du 18 janvier 2016 \u00bb.\nB. Le droit\n[13] Les R\u00e8gles sont moins strictes que les r\u00e8gles d\u2019un tribunal civil. Un membre instructeur peut exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 condition que ses d\u00e9cisions soient conformes \u00e0 l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles (paragraphe 1(1) des R\u00e8gles) :\ni. permettre que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nii. permettre que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace;\niii. permettre que toutes les affaires soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n[14] Le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles donne au membre instructeur la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des rapports d\u2019experts. Une telle flexibilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre compatible avec les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de justice naturelle.\nC. Analyse et d\u00e9cision\n[15] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne sont moins strictes que les r\u00e8gles d\u2019un tribunal civil. Certes, les intim\u00e9es se fondent sur une directive du Tribunal pour solliciter la divulgation de certains renseignements avant la production de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, cependant, il est important de ne pas retarder davantage l\u2019instruction en raison de la signification des rapports d\u2019experts. Ainsi, le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles et rend la d\u00e9cision suivante :\nEn conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles, le plaignant fournira le nom du pilote d\u2019Air Canada, ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de celui-ci aux intim\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai de deux (2) semaines \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nLes intim\u00e9es d\u00e9poseront leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans un d\u00e9lai de deux (2) semaines \u00e0 partir de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019avis du plaignant selon lequel le pilote d\u2019Air Canada sera ou ne sera pas cit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\nLes intim\u00e9es se conformeront au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles et ne sont pas tenues de produire des renseignements relatifs aux t\u00e9moins experts ou aux rapports de ceux-ci dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[16] Le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des rapports d\u2019experts. Le Tribunal conclut que, au vu des questions qui se posent \u00e0 ce jour relativement aux t\u00e9moins experts, les parties devront d\u2019abord terminer la communication des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Ensuite, une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance sera pr\u00e9vue par le Tribunal afin de discuter des questions de divulgation, de proc\u00e9dure, et de toute autre question avant de d\u00e9terminer une date d\u2019audience. Lors de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance, le plaignant avisera de son intention de citer un t\u00e9moin expert. Si tel est le cas, nous discuterons de l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier de la divulgation du nom du t\u00e9moin expert, de ses titres de comp\u00e9tence, du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage, du rapport, ainsi que de tout t\u00e9moin expert que les intim\u00e9es pourraient citer.\nIII. Ordonnance\n[17] Le Tribunal rend l\u2019ordonnance suivante :\n\u00b7 Les paragraphes 8, 9, 10, 11,17B question no 1, 18 et 20 sont radi\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant;\n\u00b7 Le plaignant fournira le nom du pilote d\u2019Air Canada qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de citer et un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de celui-ci aux intim\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai de deux (2) semaines \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision;\n\u00b7 Les intim\u00e9es d\u00e9poseront leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans un d\u00e9lai de deux (2) semaines \u00e0 partir de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019avis du plaignant selon lequel le pilote d\u2019Air Canada sera ou ne sera pas cit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin;\n\u00b7 Une date pour la tenue de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance sera pr\u00e9vue par le Tribunal. Lors de celle-ci, le plaignant devra donner un avis selon lequel il a l\u2019intention de citer ou non un t\u00e9moin expert.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAlex G.

Le contexte\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate concernant une requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 12 ao\u00fbt 2016 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance modifiant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire contre Afroglobal Network Inc. (Afroglobal), afin d\u2019inclure des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Afroglobal n\u2019est pas dat\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue \u00e0 la Commission le 18 septembre 2013. Dans cette plainte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que son employeur, Afroglobal, a fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe envers elle, entre septembre 2011 et juillet 2013; il s'agit d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite au sens du paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi. La plaignante soutient que la discrimination dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime inclut des pratiques discriminatoires, une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et le d\u00e9faut d\u2019offrir un environnement de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, en contravention des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi.\n[3] La plainte contre Michael Daramola (Daramola) est dat\u00e9e du 18 septembre 2013 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue \u00e0 la Commission le 30 septembre 2013. Cette plainte est identique \u00e0 celle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Afroglobal. Dans cette plainte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de la part de Daramola qui, \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pertinente, \u00e9tait directeur et administrateur de son employeur, Afroglobal, il s'agit d'un motif de distinction illicite au sens du paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi. La plaignante soutient que la discrimination dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime inclut une pratique discriminatoire, soit le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, en contravention de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\n[4] Les articles 7, 14 et 14.1, et le paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi sont libell\u00e9s ainsi :\n3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n14 (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n(2) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu\u2019en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n14.1. Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[5] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 14 janvier 2015, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal), afin qu\u2019il instruise les plaintes conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3) a) de la Loi, et a demand\u00e9 que les plaintes soient jointes.\n[6] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, notamment les pr\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, dat\u00e9es du 15 ao\u00fbt 2016, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate. Il ressort de cet expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de plainte envoy\u00e9 par la Commission, vers octobre 2013, Afroglobal, qui avait fait une offre de promotion d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la plaignante vers l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2013, a retir\u00e9 cette offre de promotion, en guise de repr\u00e9sailles, en raison de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante.\n[7] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission est dat\u00e9 du 12 ao\u00fbt 2016 et sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate est dat\u00e9e du 2 septembre 2016.\n[8] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Afroglobal et une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate sont dat\u00e9s du 16 septembre 2016. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions vise \u00e0 contester les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante relatives aux repr\u00e9sailles, et il en ressort que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles avanc\u00e9es par la plaignante ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur les faits.\n[9] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Daramola est dat\u00e9 du 16 septembre 2016.\n[10] La r\u00e9plique de la plaignante \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse qu\u2019Afroglobal a fournie \u00e0 la requ\u00eate est dat\u00e9e du 23 septembre 2016.\nII. Les positions des parties concernant la requ\u00eate\n[11] La position de la plaignante est la suivante :\ni) Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9coulent de la plainte originale.\nii) Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles constituent une plainte soutenable.\niii) Les faits li\u00e9s aux repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es sont connus d\u2019Afroglobal.\niv) La modification de la plainte visant \u00e0 inclure les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et la d\u00e9termination des v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties.\nv) L\u2019octroi du redressement recherch\u00e9 n\u2019entra\u00eenera aucun pr\u00e9judice.\n[12] La position de la Commission est la suivante :\ni) La position de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate satisfait \u00e0 toutes les exigences \u00e9tablies dans des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal afin que de telles modifications soient accord\u00e9es.\nii) De plus, l\u2019analyse du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 24 (SSEFPN) est applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; au paragraphe 17 de cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que :\nPar ailleurs, les membres instructeurs sont d\u2019avis que la modification ne portera pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 car celui-ci a eu amplement le temps et aura amplement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles que les plaignantes ont formul\u00e9es. Instruire la plainte initiale et les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dans le cadre de la m\u00eame instance, plut\u00f4t que de s\u00e9parer artificiellement les all\u00e9gations en de multiples instances, est une option qui est favorable \u00e0 toutes les parties et qui sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\niii) Afroglobal ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice, car l\u2019entreprise est en bonne position pour pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense et plaider sa position, parce que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9manent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que la plainte initiale, et que les actes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de repr\u00e9sailles peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte initiale.\n[13] La position d\u2019Afroglobal est la suivante :\ni) La question du pr\u00e9judice est un facteur pr\u00e9dominant \u00e0 prendre en compte dans l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si une modification peut \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e.\nii) Afroglobal subira un pr\u00e9judice si la plainte est modifi\u00e9e afin d\u2019y inclure les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la plainte originale et la modification de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\nIII. Droit et analyse\n[14] Le Tribunal dispose du pouvoir de modifier une plainte pour y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 ce principe dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, le paragraphe 30 est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\nLe Tribunal jouit d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes en vertu des paragraphes 48.9(1) et (2) et des articles 49 et 50 de la Loi. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion pour traiter d\u2019une demande d\u2019amendement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 C.F. 3, 1993 IIJCan 2990 (C.A.F.), le juge Robert D\u00e9cary a rappel\u00e9 que : \u00ab [\u2026] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu\u2019une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb.\n(Voir aussi la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au par. 13.)\n[15] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on devrait autoriser une modification, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es (Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10 (Virk), au paragraphe 7; voir aussi la d\u00e9cision Palm c. ILWU Local 500 et al., 2015 TCDP 23, au paragraphe 4).\n[16] De plus, le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables (voir la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN, aux paragraphes 7 et 14; voir aussi la d\u00e9cision Virk, au paragraphe 7).\n[17] Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il autorise la plaignante \u00e0 modifier sa plainte, le Tribunal doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration le pr\u00e9judice que subirait Afroglobal. Dans la d\u00e9cision Virk, le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00ab doit en tout temps veiller \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e un pr\u00e9avis suffisant afin de ne pas lui causer pr\u00e9judice et de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement \u00bb (voir la d\u00e9cision Virk, au paragraphe 8; voir aussi la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN, aux paragraphes 15 et 17).\n[18] Lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9cide s\u2019il doit autoriser la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte, le Tribunal ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 de la modification (voir le paragraphe 6 de la d\u00e9cision Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2 (Bressette)). Le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, lorsque les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de produire leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[19] Autoriser une modification en raison de repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas en soi une contravention \u00e0 la Loi. Dans la d\u00e9cision Bressette, le Tribunal l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante au paragraphe 8 :\nCela ne veut pas dire que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a contrevenu au paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi. Le plaignant devra prouver cela \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal a simplement conclu que la plainte initiale doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e afin d\u2019y ajouter une all\u00e9gation aux termes de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[20] Selon le Tribunal, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que celle de la plainte initiale. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019on lui a offert une promotion de vive voix. Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission, elle soutient qu\u2019Afroglobal a refus\u00e9 de lui offrir la promotion, et a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 sa place. Ainsi, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles visent les m\u00eames parties et d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que la plainte initiale.\n[21] Selon le Tribunal, Afroglobal ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si la modification est accord\u00e9e, car l\u2019entreprise aura amplement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles avanc\u00e9es par la plaignante. La position d\u2019Afroglobal selon laquelle il n\u2019y a pas de lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la plainte initiale et la modification par laquelle l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est faite n\u2019est pas, aux fins de trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, une r\u00e9ponse aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la plaignante, comme il en est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 20 ci\u2011dessus. Au contraire, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un argument sur le bien-fond\u00e9, lequel peut \u00eatre plaid\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience, comme cela ressort de la citation de la d\u00e9cision Bressette au paragraphe 19 ci\u2011dessus.\nIV. D\u00e9cision et ordonnance\n[22] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Introduction\n[1] Seize personnes \u2013 deux plaignantes [1] et quatorze non\u2011plaignants ayant obtenus le statut de parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, appel\u00e9s collectivement \u00ab le groupe Goodwin [2] \u00bb \u2013 demandent au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de rendre une ordonnance portant qu\u2019elles ont exerc\u00e9 des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb aux termes du Protocole d\u2019entente (le PE) du 3 juillet 2012 conclu entre Ruth Walden et al. et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, leur accordant une indemnisation (pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pour perte de salaire\/avantages sociaux) et d\u2019autres redressements (reclassification). L\u2019employeur, Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (EDSC), anciennement Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (RHDCC), a conclu que leur travail \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire de cas de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle (le GCRP) ne constituait pas une fonction admissible au sens du PE et, par cons\u00e9quent, aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate concerne la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience relative aux fonctions admissibles et aux questions connexes.\nII. L\u2019instance principale : Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social)\n[3] Le PE est le r\u00e9sultat de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Ruth Walden et 416 autres plaignants entre 2004 et 2007, contestant la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux (les EM), un groupe compos\u00e9 majoritairement de femmes infirmi\u00e8res prenant part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (le RPC) et \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions statuant sur ces demandes, compar\u00e9s aux conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, un groupe compos\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019hommes m\u00e9decins travaillant aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des EM. Les plaignants all\u00e9guaient qu\u2019en raison de leur classification, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux recevaient une meilleure r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, de meilleurs avantages sociaux, une meilleure formation et une plus grande reconnaissance professionnels et avaient de meilleures possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement professionnel que les EM malgr\u00e9 le fait que les deux groupes exer\u00e7aient des fonctions analogues dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC et de la prise de d\u00e9cisions statuant sur ces demandes.\n[4] Aux termes d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 (Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social), 2007 TCDP 56 (la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9), le Tribunal a conclu que, bien qu\u2019il y ait certaines diff\u00e9rences dans les responsabilit\u00e9s quotidiennes des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et des EM, la [traduction] \u00ab fonction principale \u00bb de chaque poste \u00e9tait la m\u00eame et les deux postes requ\u00e9raient l\u2019application de connaissances et de comp\u00e9tences professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de demandeurs \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC. Le Tribunal a conclu que le refus du gouvernement de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par les EM d\u2019une mani\u00e8re proportionnelle \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle accord\u00e9e au travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et violait les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H\u20116, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e, (la LCDP). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision au terme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490.\n[5] Le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision distincte concernant les r\u00e9parations dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2009 : Walden et autres c. D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada et l\u2019Agence de gestion des ressources humaines de la fonction publique du Canada, 2009 TCDP 16 (la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu que la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un nouveau sous\u2011groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) au sein du groupe professionnel Services de sant\u00e9 (SH) pour le poste d\u2019EM reconna\u00eetrait convenablement les EM en tant que professionnels de la sant\u00e9, reconnaissant ainsi qu\u2019ils utilisent leurs connaissances professionnelles \u00e9tendues des sciences infirmi\u00e8res dans le cadre de leurs fonctions. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que cela constituerait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de corriger la pratique discriminatoire cern\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, et il a ordonn\u00e9 que des travaux en vue de la cr\u00e9ation du nouveau sous-groupe NU soient entrepris dans les 60 jours de la date de la d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal n\u2019a attribu\u00e9 par ailleurs aucune indemnit\u00e9 au titre de la perte de salaire et a accord\u00e9 des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 deux individus seulement.\n[6] Au terme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration (voir Canada Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 1135), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 les conclusions du Tribunal concernant la cr\u00e9ation du nouveau sous\u2011groupe, mais elle a annul\u00e9 les conclusions du Tribunal concernant l\u2019indemnisation aux titres de la perte de salaires et de pr\u00e9judices moraux. La Cour a renvoy\u00e9 ces deux questions \u00e0 une formation diff\u00e9rente du Tribunal pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision : D\u00e9veloppement social Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2011 CAF 202. Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal m\u2019a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour agir \u00e0 titre de nouvelle \u00ab formation \u00bb et m\u2019a saisi de l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9cembre 2010.\n[7] \u00c0 la suite de ces d\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le sous\u2011groupe EM NU dans le cadre de la norme de classification Sciences infirmi\u00e8res de la fonction publique. Ce sous\u2011groupe est d\u00e9fini comme suit : \u00ab Postes responsables de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale des demandeurs \u00e0 un programme gouvernemental ou de la prestation de conseils sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s et d\u2019experts dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale \u00bb; le sous\u2011groupe comprend deux niveaux de postes d\u2019infirmier EM : le niveau NU\u2011EMA\u201101, qui correspond aux fonctions d\u2019\u00ab [\u00e9valuation] des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux dans le but de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de demandeurs \u00e0 un programme du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, et le niveau NU\u2011EMA\u201102, qui comprend \u00ab les postes de supervision des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et de sp\u00e9cialistes techniques \u00e0 l\u2019administration centrale ainsi qu\u2019en r\u00e9gion \u00bb.\n[8] Les parties ont \u00e9galement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements relatifs \u00e0 des r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es pour corriger la pratique discriminatoire : premi\u00e8rement, en concluant une entente relative \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation de pr\u00e9judices moraux, qui s\u2019est traduite par une ordonnance sur consentement dat\u00e9e du 26 octobre 2011; puis, le 3 juillet 2012, en concluant le PE, qui visait \u00e0 r\u00e9gler toutes les questions alors en suspens, dont la perte de salaires et d\u2019avantages sociaux. Aucune modification n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e au PE. C\u2019est le PE, et en particulier la d\u00e9finition qu\u2019il donne de l\u2019expression \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb, qui est vis\u00e9 par la requ\u00eate portant sur les fonctions admissibles pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le groupe Goodwin.\n[9] Le PE accorde 16 500 $ par ann\u00e9e aux individus qui ont exerc\u00e9 des [traduction] \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb durant la [traduction] \u00ab p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00bb, soit entre le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1999 et le 30 septembre 2011. Le PE pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement le paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, d\u2019une autre indemnit\u00e9 pour les individus qui ont exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles durant des p\u00e9riodes ant\u00e9rieures au 1er d\u00e9cembre 1999 ainsi que d\u2019une indemnisation additionnelle du pr\u00e9judice moral, en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP.\n[10] Les fonctions admissibles sont d\u00e9finies de la mani\u00e8re suivante \u00e0 l\u2019article premier du PE, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab D\u00e9finition de termes \u00bb :\n[traduction] \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb S\u2019entendent au sens de la d\u00e9finition de ce terme au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 26 octobre 2011, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, l\u2019individu \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 principalement dans le cadre du Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (RHDCC) soit \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, \u00e9valuer des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC et, dans l\u2019exercice de cette fonction, \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019utiliser les connaissances associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9) ou \u00e0 donner des conseils d\u2019expert aux personnes qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions ou \u00e0 superviser directement ces personnes.\n[11] Le 31 juillet 2012, le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance sur consentement mettant en \u0153uvre les dispositions du PE. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa pleine comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler tout diff\u00e9rend ou controverse entourant le sens ou l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du PE \u00e0 la demande de toute partie ou de tout individu qui aurait pu exercer des fonctions admissibles au sens du PE. Le Tribunal a initialement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 cette comp\u00e9tence jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 2014, mais, depuis, il a repouss\u00e9 cette date au 31 mars 2015, puis, sur consentement, apr\u00e8s cette date \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des paiements de majoration seulement.\nIII. Le contexte de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9examen des fonctions admissibles\n[12] De 2014 \u00e0 ce jour, le groupe Goodwin a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divulgation initiale et, par la suite, des requ\u00eates modifi\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes, pour demander que l\u2019intim\u00e9 proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une autre divulgation et production, une clarification et une explication, et qu\u2019elle donne d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 bon nombre des demandes en invoquant l\u2019absence de pertinence, la violation des droits \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements. Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 souligner que les parties ont effectu\u00e9 entre elles de nombreuses divulgations et productions.\n[13] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI) tenue le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2014, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate soit convertie en une audience orale sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les arguments quant au fond de la demande relative aux fonctions admissibles, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans des requ\u00eates ant\u00e9rieures portant sur les fonctions admissibles [3] . De nombreuses CTGI ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues entre les parties et moi afin de r\u00e9soudre des questions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience et d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant. Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des listes de t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s. Des ajouts, des suppressions et des remplacements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9s. Le 5 juin 2015, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue au sujet de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience et, en particulier, il a contest\u00e9 l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait le groupe Goodwin d\u2019obtenir que douze de ses t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s soient convoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner devant le Tribunal. De m\u00eame, j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 diverses demandes d\u2019ajournement et \u00e0 une demande de suspension de l\u2019instance tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure. Les derni\u00e8res observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 7 octobre 2016.\n[14] M. Goodwin et Mme Ladouceur ont agi pour leur propre compte et pour le compte des quatorze autres personnes qui composent le groupe Goodwin jusqu\u2019au 20 septembre 2016. Leurs observations \u00e9crites et orales sont tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9es. Je les remercie pour le temps et les efforts qu\u2019ils y ont consacr\u00e9s. Il me semble que leurs efforts et les observations des autres parties m\u2019ont permis d\u2019avoir une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019affaire [4] . Une montagne d\u2019observations et de documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s en avoir pris connaissance, ainsi que de mes notes des nombreuses CTGI que j\u2019ai tenues, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rendre ma d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au sujet de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience relative aux fonctions admissibles et donner des directives aux parties. Ma d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e en partie par l\u2019arriv\u00e9e r\u00e9cente de M. Jean\u2011Rodrigue Yoboua, agent de repr\u00e9sentation de la direction des services juridiques de l\u2019Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (et membre du barreau) pour repr\u00e9senter le groupe Goodwin. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, assortie de directives en ce qui concerne la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience relative aux fonctions admissibles et d\u2019autres questions connexes, sera utile aux parties quant aux efforts qu\u2019elles d\u00e9ploient pour r\u00e9soudre les questions en suspens portant sur la divulgation, la production et les \u00ab t\u00e9moins \u00bb. Si malgr\u00e9 tous ces efforts il subsiste des questions en litige qui, de l\u2019avis des parties et de moi\u2011m\u00eame, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre r\u00e9solues au moyen d\u2019une autre conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, je rendrai alors une autre d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nIV. Les positions des parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[15] Le groupe Goodwin soutient qu\u2019EDSC n\u2019a pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ni appliqu\u00e9 correctement, de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et coh\u00e9rente le PE relativement \u00e0 ses demandes d\u2019indemnisation pour les fonctions admissibles que les membres exer\u00e7aient en tant que GCRP dans le cadre du Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Les membres du groupe all\u00e8guent diverses incoh\u00e9rences dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, l\u2019application et l\u2019administration du PE non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du groupe Goodwin, mais aussi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres GCRP et EM qui exer\u00e7aient les m\u00eames fonctions que le groupe Goodwin. Celui\u2011ci avance \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a chang\u00e9 ses positions sur plusieurs questions cl\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 s\u00e9rieusement remettre en question sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 dans la mise en \u0153uvre et l\u2019administration du r\u00e9gime d\u2019indemnisation dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden. Par exemple, il souligne les changements de position qu\u2019aurait eus l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si ce dernier a vers\u00e9 par erreur des indemnit\u00e9s \u00e0 des titulaires de postes de GCRP (poste d\u2019attache) ne faisant pas partie du groupe Goodwin qui exer\u00e7aient des fonctions de GCRP tout comme les membres du groupe Goodwin (qui n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s). L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il chercherait \u00e0 recouvrer tout paiement fait \u00e0 tort \u00e0 des GCRP.\n[16] Le groupe Goodwin affirme \u00e9galement que la mauvaise application et mise en \u0153uvre du PE illustre non pas simplement un certain degr\u00e9 d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence ou une erreur banale, mais plut\u00f4t laisse entrevoir aussi une absence de bonne foi de la part d\u2019EDSC lorsqu\u2019il traite le groupe Goodwin (les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s non admissibles ) d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, dans un sens p\u00e9joratif, par rapport aux autres EM et GCRP ne faisant pas partie du groupe Goodwin qui ont re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden (les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s admissibles, ou ceux qui \u00e9taient des infirmiers autoris\u00e9s ayant une exp\u00e9rience en tant qu\u2019EM). En effet, le groupe Goodwin soutient qu\u2019EDSC avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qui devait recevoir les indemnit\u00e9s et qui n\u2019allait pas les recevoir bien avant qu\u2019il ne n\u00e9gocie les mesures de redressement dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden fond\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne, y compris le PE. En outre, le groupe Goodwin all\u00e8gue qu\u2019EDSC a simplement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieurement prises quant aux personnes qui devaient recevoir des indemnit\u00e9s, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la signature du PE et de l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9torque que [traduction] \u00ab La question dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est de savoir si la fonction de GCRP est une fonction admissible, non de savoir si une erreur peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commise en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement avec une personne qui n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate \u00bb. La mention de personne \u00ab non partie \u00bb indique la d\u00e9cision d\u2019EDSC d\u2019indemniser et de consid\u00e9rer les personnes dont le poste d\u2019attache \u00e9tait EM pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au PE comme ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles, peu importe les fonctions r\u00e9elles exerc\u00e9es. Les paiements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s en faveur de ceux qui occupaient des postes d\u2019attache EM, mais qui n\u2019effectuaient pas r\u00e9ellement d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale [\u2026] \u00bb ou qui n\u2019avaient pas pour fonction de [traduction] \u00ab donner des conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb et\/ou de [traduction] \u00ab superviser directement ces personnes \u00bb au sens de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb au PE, n\u2019ont certes pas \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vus dans le PE. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 EDSC d\u2019effectuer de tels paiements pour des raisons d\u2019ordre administratif ou de logistique (il y avait environ 850 plaignants et non\u2011plaignants et les documents prouvant les fonctions r\u00e9elles exerc\u00e9es durant les 33 ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Walden (p\u00e9riodes 1 et 2) n\u2019existaient plus pour aucun d\u2019eux. (Le groupe Goodwin conteste cette derni\u00e8re affirmation.)\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les autres questions soulev\u00e9es par le groupe Goodwin ne se rapportent ni ne sont pertinentes \u00e0 la question principale. Outre le fait d\u2019entra\u00eener une divulgation de renseignements non pertinents de nature \u00e0 compromettre la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e et\/ou le privil\u00e8ge de r\u00e8glement, ces questions ne seraient pas utiles \u00e0 l\u2019audience et occasionneraient n\u00e9anmoins une utilisation suppl\u00e9mentaire de temps et de ressources pr\u00e9cieuses.\n[19] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 [traduction] : \u00ab EDSC soutient que le Tribunal, aussi bien dans son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat que dans celui des parties, doit imposer des crit\u00e8res raisonnables concernant la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate \u00bb.\nV. Analyse : Port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience relative aux fonctions admissibles et aux questions connexes\nA. La question principale\n[20] Comme je l\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans les motifs de la d\u00e9cision McIlroy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, que j\u2019ai rendus relativement \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate sur les fonctions admissibles, pour trancher de telles requ\u00eates, je dois examiner le PE, notamment le sens ordinaire des mots qu\u2019il contient, les intentions des parties et, au titre d\u2019une analyse contextuelle, le litige plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en cause. Le \u00ab litige plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb comprend les plaintes effectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9paration (y compris toute d\u00e9cision de mise en \u0153uvre) et toute conclusion ou commentaire pertinent des tribunaux judiciaires dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou d\u2019un appel. Le PE est enracin\u00e9 dans les plaintes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par plus de 400 EM, et \u00e9nonce qu\u2019il vise \u00e0 \u00ab r\u00e9gler toutes les questions qui restent en litige et qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une ou plusieurs des plaintes \u00bb. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9 et conclu dans un vide. Le PE n\u2019est pas une entente autonome : elle est devenue une ordonnance du Tribunal.\n[21] Je ne saurais trop insister sur le fait que nous sommes \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape de mise en \u0153uvre des mesures de redressement prises dans la d\u00e9cision Walden. La question cl\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce consiste \u00e0 nous demander si les seize membres du groupe Goodwin, en tant que GCRP ex\u00e9cutant un travail de RP (qu\u2019ils appellent \u00ab \u00e9valuation \u00bb), sont vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb au PE et ont droit \u00e0 une indemnisation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et \u00e0 d\u2019autres mesures de redressement qu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9es (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, la reclassification [5] ).\n[22] Bien que les dispositions de l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve de la comp\u00e9tence ayant approuv\u00e9 le PE aient une vaste port\u00e9e, elles ne peuvent pas conf\u00e9rer une comp\u00e9tence qui ne trouve aucun fondement dans la LCDP. Les deux ordonnances sur consentement comportent un pr\u00e9ambule qui reconna\u00eet que les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es \u00bb (faisant \u00e9cho au libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP), selon la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9. Toute r\u00e9paration d\u00e9coulant de ces conclusions \u2013 y compris dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration elle-m\u00eame \u2013, d\u2019ententes entre les parties \u2013 comme le PE \u2013 ou d\u2019autres ordonnances du Tribunal doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9senter un lien avec l\u2019objet des plaintes. Les requ\u00eates comme celle dont il est ici question ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme appelant simplement et uniquement un exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contractuelle.\n[23] Il est important de pr\u00e9ciser que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve de la comp\u00e9tence s\u2019appliquent \u00ab \u00e0 la demande de toute partie ou de tout individu qui aurait pu exercer des fonctions admissibles au sens du PE \u00bb. Elles ne sont pas cens\u00e9es pr\u00e9voir un examen ou une analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par le Tribunal ou \u00e0 l\u2019initiative d\u2019une partie concernant la mise en \u0153uvre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019indemnisation dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden. Le paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement accorde aux individus parties et non\u2011parties le droit de pr\u00e9senter leurs demandes individuelles respectives pour le r\u00e9examen de la question de fonctions admissibles. Le Tribunal a conserv\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence pour examiner des questions distinctes dont il est saisi, telles que la requ\u00eate portant sur les fonctions admissibles pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Groupe Goodwin [6] .\n[24] Sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 mes commentaires ci\u2011dessus, le but est bien entendu de r\u00e9aliser une mise en \u0153uvre et une administration parfaites du PE et des ordonnances sur consentement. Les all\u00e9gations et les observations du groupe Goodwin soul\u00e8vent des sujets de pr\u00e9occupation auxquels EDSC a r\u00e9serv\u00e9, dans sa mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision Walden, une r\u00e9ponse qui laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Cela peut comprendre des personnes qui ont re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s par erreur, selon ma d\u00e9cision finale quant au fond au sujet de la requ\u00eate portant sur les fonctions admissibles pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le groupe Goodwin. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 que dans un cas pareil, il chercherait \u00e0 recouvrer les paiements en question.\n[25] Je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par des questions relatives aux personnes qui ont re\u00e7u paiement alors qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas, et par celles qui n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u paiement alors qu\u2019elles devraient. La question pr\u00e9sente un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la requ\u00eate relative aux fonctions admissibles, mais elle n\u2019est pas pertinente \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En d\u2019autres termes, de telles erreurs (dans les deux exemples) d\u00e9passent la juste port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate relative aux fonctions admissibles. Je tiens \u00e0 apporter cette pr\u00e9cision, car, m\u00eame si EDSC a commis une erreur en payant des GCRP qui ne font pas partie du groupe Goodwin (ou m\u00eame des EM), cela ne rend pas admissibles en soi les fonctions des GCRP dans le cadre du PE. Cela ressemble en quelque sorte \u00e0 l\u2019adage que nous avons appris encore enfants et qui dit que l\u2019[traduction] : \u00ab On ne corrige pas le mal par le mal \u00bb. Toute erreur commise par EDSC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en \u0153uvre ou de l\u2019administration de la d\u00e9cision Walden ne modifie en rien les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s des GCRP et ne rend pas leurs fonctions admissibles pour une indemnisation dans le cadre du PE.\n[26] La question principale dont je suis saisi est la suivante : les GCRP ont\u2011ils exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles dans le cadre du PE? Les parties ont exprim\u00e9 leur accord \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le point de convergence se trouve dans des questions qui se situent bien au\u2011del\u00e0, dans le genre de renseignements qui doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s avant la tenue de l\u2019audience et dans la nature de la preuve (documentaire ou testimoniale) qui doit \u00eatre produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[27] Pour faire valoir sa demande, le Groupe Goodwin devra produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui d\u00e9montrent les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s des VRCM pendant les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes (vers 1990-2011). Il en sera de m\u00eame pour EDSC. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le grand volume d\u2019observations et de documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties ainsi que leurs observations orales suppl\u00e9mentaires, je souhaite particuli\u00e8rement entendre les t\u00e9moignages et les observations concernant l\u2019affirmation du groupe Goodwin selon laquelle les VRCM exer\u00e7aient des fonctions d\u2019 \u00ab \u00e9valuation \u00bb tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 celles des EM charg\u00e9s de la r\u00e9\u00e9valuation (RM), qu\u2019il y avait un important \u00ab chevauchement \u00bb entre les fonctions dont les lignes de d\u00e9marcation \u00e9taient \u00ab floues \u00bb, y compris dans les r\u00e9gions, et qu\u2019il y avait de nombreuses personnes qui combinaient les fonctions de RM et de VRCM. En outre, EDSC les aurait consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab mod\u00e8le de prestation de services pour le retour au travail \u00bb unifi\u00e9, en application du [traduction] \u00ab continuum de processus et de politiques pour le retour au travail \u00bb, pour lequel on ne peut distinguer les d\u00e9cisions op\u00e9rationnelles des ressources combin\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es (p. ex., syst\u00e8me de gestion de dossiers compl\u00e8tement informatis\u00e9, le [traduction] \u00ab rapport des EM et de retour au travail \u00bb mensuel).\n[28] Compte tenu du fait que le groupe compos\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019hommes m\u00e9decins \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tait le groupe de comparaison dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et que la r\u00e9paration doit avoir une connexion ou \u00eatre li\u00e9e aux conclusions en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9, j\u2019aimerais \u00e9galement entendre tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou tout argument concernant, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, le chevauchement qu\u2019il y avait entre les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et celles des VRCM.\nB. Le PE : l\u2019intention des parties\n[29] Selon la conclusion que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Mcllroy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, une partie de la question principale [traduction] \u00ab Les VRCM ont-ils exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles dans le cadre du PE \u00bb comporte une seconde pr\u00e9occupation : quelle \u00e9tait l\u2019intention des parties au PE \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des fonctions des VRCM et de la r\u00e9paration dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden? Le groupe Goodwin propose d\u2019appeler Me Laurence Armstrong (avocate de la plupart des plaignants et n\u00e9gociatrice du PE) et Nancy Lawand \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a des t\u00e9moins potentiels qui pourraient \u00e9galement s\u2019exprimer au sujet de cette question : Mary Pichette et son avocate, Me Lynn Marchildon. Une autre question subsiste : quelle intention animait les parties au PE lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9largi les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration aux deux groupes ou classes additionnels d\u2019individus, vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis des VRCM? J\u2019ajoute cette question parce que le groupe Goodwin a aussi inclus pour certains de ses membres la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle ils sont aussi admissibles au titre de la deuxi\u00e8me (\u00ab donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb) et de la troisi\u00e8me (\u00ab supervisaient directement \u00bb) cat\u00e9gorie de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb. Bien que la vaste majorit\u00e9 de ceux qui ont re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s rel\u00e8ve de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie, cela ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme cr\u00e9ant une hi\u00e9rarchie entre les trois groupes constitutifs au sein du PE.\nC. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9\n[30] Le groupe Goodwin cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve, \u00e0 la fois au moyen de t\u00e9moignages et de documents, qui met en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9. En particulier, il conteste la mise en \u0153uvre incoh\u00e9rente du PE par EDSC et son application au groupe Goodwin et \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes. Cela serait d\u00e9montr\u00e9, par exemple, par les positions changeantes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur les questions relatives \u00e0 la justification ou \u00e0 la formule utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer les personnes qui ont re\u00e7u l\u2019indemnisation et si les personnes dont le poste d\u2019attache \u00e9tait VRCM avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 tort pour avoir ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches de VRCM, ce que le groupe Goodwin estime \u00eatre des fonctions admissibles au titre du PE.\n[31] Le groupe Goodwin sera autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de ses t\u00e9moins, et\/ou la fiabilit\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage, sur des questions qui sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019audience. En d\u2019autres termes, plus l\u2019interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins et la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve s\u2019\u00e9loignent des questions importantes en litige, moins de latitude sera accord\u00e9e. La cl\u00e9 est la pertinence. L\u2019attention devrait rester concentr\u00e9e sur la question centrale ou principale comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 plut\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, y compris la question de savoir comment et pour quelle raison EDSC a \u00e9tabli les fonctions admissibles au sujet des dossiers respectifs des seize membres du groupe Goodwin.\nD. La lettre de Me Iyer concernant le retrait de la requ\u00eate en divulgation\n[32] Le groupe Goodwin a \u00e9t\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019avocate de Vancouver, Me Nitya lyer. Cette derni\u00e8re et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont conclu une entente sur des questions de divulgation qui \u00e9taient en suspens \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 novembre 2014, Me Nitya lyer a retir\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en divulgation qui \u00e9tait en instance devant le Tribunal, selon les conditions suivantes :\n[traduction]\n1. Quatre lettres provenant d\u2019EDSC dat\u00e9es du 23 mai 2014, du 10 juillet 2014, du 29 juillet 2014 et du 31 octobre 2014 (les copies sont en annexe) seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate sur consentement portant sur les fonctions admissibles introduite par le groupe Goodwin, et EDSC ne contestera pas les faits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, sous r\u00e9serve de ce qui suit :\na. En ce qui concerne la lettre du 23 mai 2014, le groupe Goodwin et EDSC ont convenu que cette lettre donne le contexte quant aux raisons pour lesquelles EDSC a accept\u00e9, aux fins de r\u00e8glement, qu\u2019une personne exer\u00e7ait des fonctions admissibles durant toute p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle elle occupait un poste d\u2019attache d\u2019\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical.\nb. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la lettre du 10 juillet 2014, si le groupe Goodwin a l\u2019intention de se fonder sur la d\u00e9claration figurant dans cette lettre, et selon laquelle Mme Ladouceur n\u2019a jamais occup\u00e9 un poste d\u2019\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical, une occasion sera donn\u00e9e \u00e0 EDSC pour qu\u2019il puisse examiner les observations formul\u00e9es par Mme Ladouceur sur ce fait et corriger la d\u00e9claration.\nc. Pour ce qui est de la lettre du 29 juillet 2014, si le groupe Goodwin a l\u2019intention de se fonder sur l\u2019explication d\u2019EDSC quant aux personnes qu\u2019il souhaitait contacter en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en divulgation de Mme Ladouceur, une occasion sera accord\u00e9e \u00e0 EDSC pour qu\u2019il clarifie comment EDSC a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les personnes qu\u2019il faut contacter et celles qu\u2019il a effectivement contact\u00e9es.\n[33] Pendant la CTGI du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2016, M. Goodwin, qui \u00e9tait redevenu repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, ainsi que Mme Ladouceur, du groupe Goodwin, ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 la position de son groupe selon laquelle EDSC n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 les conditions de l\u2019entente conclue entre Me Iyer et Mme Marchildon, tel que cela ressort de la lettre du 21 novembre 2014. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas honor\u00e9 l\u2019entente, le groupe Goodwin a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de nouveau sa requ\u00eate en divulgation.\n[34] Mme Marchildon a r\u00e9pondu ainsi, le 3 mars 2016 [traduction] : \u00ab [\u2026] une juste interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente conclue entre moi et Me Iyer confirme que le moment o\u00f9 EDSC doit obtenir la possibilit\u00e9 de clarifier les points b. et c., c\u2019est lors de l\u2019audience sur le fond de votre requ\u00eate, non avant. Toutefois, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 vos demandes concernant ces points, j\u2019ai propos\u00e9 de vous donner maintenant les clarifications et les corrections qu\u2019EDSC aurait pu d\u00e9cider de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00bb. Elle a ensuite donn\u00e9 les renseignements en question dans la m\u00eame lettre.\n[35] Le groupe Goodwin conteste l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 a respect\u00e9 les conditions de l\u2019entente conclue entre Me Iyer et Mme Marchildon.\n[36] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la lettre du 21 novembre 2014 de Me Iyer, et les quatre lettres constitutives, ainsi que les observations \u00e9crites et orales des parties. Je souscris aux observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les droits futurs pour adapter le contexte factuel tel qu\u2019il figure dans les lettres appartenaient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui pouvait les exercer s\u2019il le souhaitait. Le groupe Goodwin n\u2019avait le droit de pr\u00e9senter de nouveau la requ\u00eate en divulgation qu\u2019en cas de violation de l\u2019entente conclue entre Me Iyer et Mme Marchildon. Je conclus que l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e.\n[37] L\u2019intim\u00e9 veut \u00e9galement obtenir que je rende une d\u00e9cision visant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher le groupe Goodwin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9surrection d\u2019une partie de son ordonnance de divulgation en demandant au Tribunal de convoquer quatre personnes \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions semblables qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es au moyen de la lettre de Me Iyer. L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure que de permettre au groupe Goodwin d\u2019agir ainsi. Selon la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019avocat [traduction] : \u00ab [\u2026] il serait in\u00e9quitable de permettre au groupe Goodwin de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau de questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation en l\u2019autorisant \u00e0 demander aux t\u00e9moins de s\u2019exprimer sur des faits qui ne sont plus contest\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[38] Le groupe Goodwin r\u00e9torque en disant que la mesure en question est loin de constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure, au sens o\u00f9 ce terme technique juridique est connu. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que j\u2019arrive \u00e0 une telle conclusion pour trancher la question. Je conclus que les conditions de l\u2019entente relative \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure et \u00e0 la preuve telle qu\u2019elle figure dans la lettre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es. En outre, le groupe Goodwin \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Sur le plan des politiques publiques, il y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 respecter les ententes conclues entre les parties par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de leurs avocats. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne proc\u00e9derai pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture ou \u00e0 l\u2019examen des demandes de divulgation, telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par le groupe Goodwin jusqu\u2019au retrait de la requ\u00eate le 21 novembre 2014.\nE. Les autres demandes de divulgation\n[39] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, le groupe Goodwin a ajout\u00e9 de nombreuses demandes de divulgation et de production \u00e0 ses demandes initiales. Les derni\u00e8res demandes et observations de cette nature ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues le 18 mai 2016. La conclusion tir\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment concernant l\u2019entente conclue entre Me Iyer et Mme Marchildon ne porte pas sur les demandes de divulgations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la lettre du 21 novembre 2014. J\u2019invite les parties \u00e0 communiquer entre elles dans le but de trouver une solution aux demandes de divulgations post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la lettre du 21 novembre 2014. Pour ce faire, elles doivent tenir compte des observations que j\u2019ai formul\u00e9es au sujet de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Bon nombre de ces demandes de divulgation peuvent devenir th\u00e9oriques par suite de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[40] En outre, j\u2019aimerais formuler des observations au sujet de la nature d\u2019une divulgation et d\u2019une production de documents selon les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure). Le r\u00e9gime de divulgation et de production de documents selon les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal est plus restrictif que le processus d\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable utilis\u00e9 dans les instances civiles au Canada, qui comprend l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable oral, et aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, qui emploie aussi couramment l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable \u00e9crit et les interrogatoires \u00e9crits. Le processus de divulgation des documents du Tribunal est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration et \u00e0 la production de documents potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou un redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties [7] . Cela fait partie de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (ou, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les documents de requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9s) [8] , ainsi que l\u2019identification des t\u00e9moins et un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu (ou \u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s \u00bb). Le but de la divulgation des pr\u00e9cisions, des \u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s \u00bb et des documents est de communiquer la preuve qu\u2019une partie entend pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ce qui, par la suite, permet aux parties de pr\u00e9senter efficacement leur preuve respective \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La demande de production d\u2019autres documents ou pr\u00e9cisions ne devrait pas \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb ou constituer un moyen de contester la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 quant aux faits et aux questions plaid\u00e9es par la partie adverse (voir les d\u00e9cisions Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 43, et Bailie et autres c. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2011 TCDP 17, au paragraphe 15).\n[41] J\u2019ai formul\u00e9 les observations ci\u2011dessus parce qu\u2019un bon nombre des demandes de divulgation du groupe Goodwin ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de rendre des ordonnances \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la communication des documents. Bon nombre des demandes concernent des ordonnances visant \u00e0 obtenir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit tenu de fournir des renseignements pour [traduction] \u00ab clarifier \u00bb, [traduction] \u00ab expliquer \u00bb ou [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9ciser \u00bb. Par exemple, le groupe Goodwin [traduction] \u00ab demande \u00e0 EDSC de clarifier les mesures qu\u2019il a prises concernant le refus de communication du courriel de M. Cameron [\u2026] \u00bb et qu\u2019EDSC [traduction] \u00ab clarifie \u00bb le sens de l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab R\u00e9\u00e9valuation pour la RP \u00bb. Peu importe que de telles demandes constituent des [traductions] \u00ab pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb raisonnables, je laisse le soin aux parties de mener des n\u00e9gociations en tenant compte des observations que j\u2019ai formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate au sujet de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience. La question qui se pose aux parties est de savoir si l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre renseignement demand\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire pour que la partie se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 faire valoir ses arguments devant le Tribunal, et d\u2019\u00e9viter toute surprise pouvant justifier la demande d\u2019un ajournement. Par ailleurs, cela devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience m\u00eame sur la question des fonctions admissibles.\nF. L\u2019application des mesures de r\u00e9paration aux GCRP ne faisant pas partie du groupe Goodwin\n[42] Dans la lettre du 7 octobre 2016 qu\u2019il a adress\u00e9e au Tribunal, M. Yoboua s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 ainsi [traduction] : \u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 que toute r\u00e9paration ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal ne concernera que les seize intim\u00e9s [sic]; toutefois, les plaignants estiment que le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas encore prononc\u00e9 sur cette question et qu\u2019elle demeure non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e \u00bb. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la lettre de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 et la lettre provenant du greffe du Tribunal ainsi que mes notes prises lors de la CTGI au cours de laquelle la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et abord\u00e9e. Je reconnais la d\u00e9claration figurant dans la lettre du Tribunal du 24 mars 2016 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019une des questions \u00e9crites de M. Goodwin : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] s\u2019il est fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, toute indemnit\u00e9 ne sera accord\u00e9e qu\u2019aux membres du groupe Goodwin qui peuvent \u00e9tablir qu\u2019ils ont exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles \u00bb. Cela correspondait \u00e0 ce qui semblait au d\u00e9part \u00eatre l\u2019entente des parties sur la question \u00e0 la CTGI de f\u00e9vrier 2016. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre r\u00e9flexion au sujet de l\u2019affirmation subs\u00e9quente de M. Goodwin selon laquelle il : [traduction] \u00ab avait l\u2019impression de ne pas \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question du membre instructeur [durant la CTGI] et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent peu dispos\u00e9 et h\u00e9sitant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une telle question sans avoir re\u00e7u de conseil juridique sur le sujet \u00bb, il convient que les observations sur cette question soient r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour l\u2019audience sur les fonctions admissibles.\nG. Les autres questions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience\n[43] Je souhaite aborder deux autres questions avec les parties. Premi\u00e8rement, il faudrait \u00e0 un certain moment prendre en compte quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (t\u00e9moignages et documents) et quelles observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden aux \u00e9tapes de la responsabilit\u00e9 et de la r\u00e9paration, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les parties souhaitent pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur les fonctions admissibles du groupe Goodwin. Deuxi\u00e8mement, comme il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 lors d\u2019une CTGI ant\u00e9rieure, au moment opportun, les parties devraient faire tout ce qui est en leur pouvoir pour \u00e9tablir un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits.\nVI. Ordonnance\n[44] Apr\u00e8s lecture des observations \u00e9crites et des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et, apr\u00e8s audition des observations orales suppl\u00e9mentaires, j\u2019ordonne aux parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate de communiquer entre elles et de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal, au plus tard le 13 janvier 2017, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na. Une liste des questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et que je dois approuver, et des questions pr\u00e9cises qui demeurent non r\u00e9solues (p. ex., celles concernant la divulgation et les t\u00e9moins) et qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es, y compris les ordonnances qui doivent \u00eatre rendues. Les renvois \u00e0 des observations ant\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es doivent \u00eatre inclus.\nb. Des listes r\u00e9vis\u00e9es de t\u00e9moins, y compris toute nouvelle liste propos\u00e9e, et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus (\u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s \u00bb) r\u00e9vis\u00e9s ou nouveaux;\nc. Un tableau indiquant les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9cises demand\u00e9es (indemnisation et reclassification) et les montants (s\u2019ils sont connus) ainsi que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la demande, pour chacun des seize membres du groupe Goodwin, y compris laquelle des trois cat\u00e9gories de fonctions admissibles le membre invoque au titre du PE.\nSign\u00e9 par\nMatthew D. Garfield\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 22 novembre 2016\n[1] Mme Pick et Mme Taylor ont toutes les deux re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden en tant que plaignantes ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions \u00e0 titre d\u2019EM, et avaient donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualit\u00e9 pour agir devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles sont incluses dans la d\u00e9cision \u00ab Walden et al. \u00bb dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause\/de l\u2019instance. Elles font \u00e9galement partie des seize personnes \u2013 le groupe Goodwin \u2013 qui demandent des indemnit\u00e9s et d\u2019autres redressements relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions en tant que GCRP.\n[2] M. Goodwin est la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la requ\u00eate le 27 juin 2014 pour le compte du groupe et a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 celui\u2011ci jusqu\u2019au 20 septembre 2016.\n[3] Voir la d\u00e9cision Walden et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2015 TCDP 15 (\u00ab McIlroy \u00bb).\n[4] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un m\u00e9moire concernant sa position g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au sujet des facteurs \u00e0 prendre en compte dans les requ\u00eates portant sur les fonctions admissibles, mais elle n\u2019a pas exprim\u00e9 son opinion quant au bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la demande du groupe Goodwin. Son avocat a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019assisterait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience relative aux fonctions admissibles. La Commission a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de br\u00e8ves observations sur d\u2019autres questions pr\u00e9liminaires et a particip\u00e9 aux nombreuses CTGI qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues.\n[5] Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que les parties devront pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e0 l\u2019audience quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci pour accorder une mesure de redressement consistant en une reclassification.\n[6] Le Tribunal n\u2019a plus comp\u00e9tence pour examiner des diff\u00e9rends d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement dat\u00e9e du 26 octobre 2011, en application du paragraphe 8.\n[7] Les paragraphes 6(1) et 6(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les parties doivent \u00e9galement mentionner, mais ne sont pas tenues de produire, tout document pour lequel un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9.\n[8] Aucun expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une requ\u00eate sur les fonctions admissibles, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision Walden.",

Hommage\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision concerne les enfants. Elle porte plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur les pratiques, actuelles et pass\u00e9es, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance au sein des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves du Canada et, sur les r\u00e9percussions que ces pratiques ont eues et continuent d\u2019avoir pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, pour leurs familles et pour leurs collectivit\u00e9s.\n[2] L\u2019histoire des pensionnats indiens et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue par ceux qui les ont fr\u00e9quent\u00e9s, ou qui en ont souffert, a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une preuve abondante au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement entendu le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9mouvant d\u2019une personne qui a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un pensionnat et qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 directement touch\u00e9e. D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, les membres du Tribunal entendant cette affaire (le Panel) estiment qu\u2019il est important de reconna\u00eetre les souffrances v\u00e9cues par tous les survivants des pensionnats, leurs familles et leurs collectivit\u00e9s. Nous saluons le courage de ceux qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de leur exp\u00e9rience au fil des ans et qui ont pris la parole devant le Tribunal. Nous tenons \u00e9galement \u00e0 honorer la m\u00e9moire des nombreux enfants qui sont morts et de tous ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de s\u00e9vices alors qu\u2019ils fr\u00e9quentaient ces pensionnats, sans oublier leurs familles et leurs collectivit\u00e9s. Nous souhaitons \u00e0 tous les peuples autochtones du Canada, la gu\u00e9rison et la reconnaissance des traumatismes individuels et collectifs subis en raison du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens.\nII. La plainte et le contexte\n[3] Les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, ou services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, sont des services visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les enfants et \u00e0 encourager la stabilit\u00e9 de la famille. Ils visent d\u2019abord et avant tout \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les enfants de la violence et de la n\u00e9gligence (annexe, pi\u00e8ce 1, \u00ab protection de l\u2019enfance \u00bb). Ainsi, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant est un principe fondamental dans la prestation de ces services, qui est reconnu tant en droit international qu\u2019en droit canadien. Ce principe doit guider les d\u00e9cisions susceptibles d\u2019avoir des cons\u00e9quences sur les enfants. Ce principe s`applique \u00e0 tous les enfants, y compris les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[4] Chaque province et chaque territoire poss\u00e8de sa propre l\u00e9gislation et ses propres normes en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et, fournit ces services sur son territoire. Toutefois, l\u2019objet sp\u00e9cifique de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est la prestation de services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves ainsi qu\u2019au Yukon.\n[5] Les questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce portent sur la gestion du Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (le Programme des SEFPN) par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (AINC), aujourd\u2019hui le minist\u00e8re des Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC). Elles portent \u00e9galement sur les mod\u00e8les de financement du Programme et sur quelques ententes provinciales et territoriales connexes en mati\u00e8re de services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. Le Programme des SEFPN et les ententes pr\u00e9voient que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille sont fournis aux Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon par des organismes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (organismes de SEFPN), ou par la province ou le territoire dans lequel la collectivit\u00e9 est situ\u00e9e. Dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, c\u2019est la l\u00e9gislation sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de la province ou du territoire o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9e la Premi\u00e8re Nation qui s\u2019applique. AADNC finance les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille qui sont fournis aux Premi\u00e8res Nations par les organismes de SEFPN ou par la province ou le territoire.\n[6] Les plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN), all\u00e8guent qu\u2019AADNC agit de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. Elles pr\u00e9cisent qu\u2019AADNC fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique dans la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon, en finan\u00e7ant de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9quitable ou insuffisante les services en question (la plainte), contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Le 14 octobre 2008, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il l\u2019instruise.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire rejeter la plainte (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence), \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 14 mars 2011 (2011 TCDP 4). Le Tribunal arriva \u00e0 la conclusion que les questions soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient sa comp\u00e9tence. Cette d\u00e9cision a par la suite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada.\n[8] Le 18 avril 2012, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal sur la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence, (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445) (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 une formation du Tribunal diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9e afin qu\u2019elle soit r\u00e9examin\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses motifs. L\u2019appel de cette d\u00e9cision interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2013 CAF 75 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CAF).\n[9] Une nouvelle formation coll\u00e9giale a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e pour instruire la plainte. Elle \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de trois juges administratifs\/membres instructeurs soit Sophie Marchildon (Pr\u00e9sidente de la formation), R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer et Edward Lustig. (2012 TCDP 16). Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour faire instruire de nouveau la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence et il a statu\u00e9 que la plainte serait instruite au fond (2012 TCDP 17).\n[10] La plainte a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e pour y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles (2012 TCDP 24). Au d\u00e9but de juin 2015, le Tribunal a conclu que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient en partie fond\u00e9es (2015 TCDP 14).\n[11] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte. Au cours des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, notre coll\u00e8gue et ami, le membre instructeur R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 sa pr\u00e9cieuse contribution \u00e0 l\u2019audience et son \u00e9tude du pr\u00e9sent dossier, il n\u2019a malheureusement pu voir le r\u00e9sultat final de son travail. Bien que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision soit sign\u00e9e par les autres membres instructeurs, nous tenons \u00e0 honorer sa m\u00e9moire et nous la lui d\u00e9dions.\nIII. Les parties\n[12] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) est un organisme sans but lucratif vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques et \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense des organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u0153uvrant au bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des jeunes et des familles autochtones. L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN) est une organisation nationale qui d\u00e9fend les int\u00e9r\u00eats de plus de 600 Premi\u00e8res Nations sur des questions telles que les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s, l\u2019\u00e9ducation, le logement, la sant\u00e9, la protection de l\u2019enfance et le d\u00e9veloppement social. Lorsqu\u2019elle compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) repr\u00e9sente l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (article 51 de la LCDP). Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC) est le minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral principalement charg\u00e9 de s\u2019assurer que le gouvernement du Canada s\u2019acquitte de ses obligations et de ses engagements envers les peuples autochtones.\n[13] Par ailleurs, deux organismes ont obtenu le statut de \u00ab parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00bb \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance : Amnistie internationale et Chiefs of Ontario (COO). Amnistie internationale est un organisme non gouvernemental international qui promeut les droits de la personne partout dans le monde. Elle a obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e devant le Tribunal pour l\u2019\u00e9clairer sur la pertinence, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, des obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Chiefs of Ontario (COO) est un organisme sans but lucratif repr\u00e9sentant les 133 Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario. Il a obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e devant le Tribunal pour traiter des particularit\u00e9s des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves en Ontario.\nIV. L\u2019audience, la divulgation de la preuve et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents\n[14] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue sur une p\u00e9riode de 72 jours, de f\u00e9vrier 2013 \u00e0 octobre 2014. Durant l\u2019audience, la divulgation des documents et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de certains d\u2019entre eux en preuve ont engendr\u00e9 des complications.\n[15] Ce ne sont pas tous les documents susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audience. AANDC avait accept\u00e9 de divulguer toute sa preuve avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience et avait par la suite confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019avait fait. Et pourtant, il manquait plusieurs documents potentiellement pertinents, dont il connaissait l\u2019existence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2012, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audience. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s une demande faite par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et, peu de temps avant la troisi\u00e8me semaine d\u2019audience, qu\u2019AADNC a inform\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal de l\u2019existence de plus de 50 000 documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il nous a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9s de l\u2019existence d\u2019un nombre ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 de courriels susceptibles de se rapporter \u00e0 la plainte, mais qui n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a annul\u00e9 les dates d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vues pour juin 2013 et a r\u00e9organis\u00e9 l\u2019instance de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 entendre les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles en juillet et en ao\u00fbt 2013. Apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 31 ao\u00fbt 2013 \u00e0 AADNC pour compl\u00e9ter sa divulgation, le Tribunal a repris l\u2019instruction au fond d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2013 \u00e0 janvier 2014 (2013 TCDP 16).\n[16] L\u2019audience a repris \u00e0 la suite de la divulgation, par AADNC, de plus de 100 000 documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, AADNC n\u2019a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 la divulgation de tous les documents pertinents qu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2014 en raison d\u2019une opposition en vertu du paragraphe 37(1) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. En effet, AANDC soutenait que certains documents \u00e9manaient du Cabinet et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, ils \u00e9taient confidentiels. Toutes les parties ont accept\u00e9 que le greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 examine ces documents pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019exclusion applicable aux documents confidentiels du Cabinet s\u2019appliquait. Cet examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 assez rapidement apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception des documents par le greffier.\n[17] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a soulev\u00e9 une question concernant la mani\u00e8re d\u2019admettre en preuve les 100 000 documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Elle a demand\u00e9 que soit rendue une ordonnance aux termes de laquelle tout document qu\u2019elle souhaitait invoquer serait admis pour la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu, que l\u2019auteur ou le destinataire du document en cause soit cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ou non, ou que le document en cause soit port\u00e9 \u00e0 la connaissance d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins ou non. Pour des motifs expos\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision 2014 TCDP 2, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 ce qui suit :\na. Le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure continuera de s\u2019appliquer. Ainsi, les documents continueront d\u2019\u00eatre re\u00e7us en preuve au cas par cas, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019audience et accept\u00e9s par le Tribunal;\nb. Il sera inutile de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre dans le seul but d\u2019authentifier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire. Le Tribunal examinera toute question relative \u00e0 l\u2019authentification de ces documents au stade de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la preuve;\nc. Au sens du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, un document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et admis en preuve\u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant qu\u2019un avocat ou un t\u00e9moin de la partie qui le pr\u00e9sente n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\ni. sur quelles parties du document on se fonde;\nii. quel est le lien entre ces parties du document et une des questions en litige.\nd. Si une partie souhaite se fonder sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9crite ci-dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019argumentation finale (que ce soit avant que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ou apr\u00e8s), le Tribunal pourra prendre les mesures curatives qui s\u2019imposent, et, notamment, il lui sera possible d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate, notamment en citant d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et en produisant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire additionnels, conform\u00e9ment au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c0 la suite de cela, il se pourrait que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e.\n[18] D\u2019autres questions concernant les documents qui devaient faire partie du dossier de preuve du Tribunal ont surgi apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019audience. AADNC s\u2019est interrog\u00e9 sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents qui furent invoqu\u00e9s par les avocats des parties plaignantes et de la Commission sur lesquels aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ne fut faite \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans la d\u00e9cision 2015 TCDP 1 :\nLes documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B de la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 1er d\u00e9cembre 2014 (y compris ceux auxquels il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que dans les observations \u00e9crites finales \u2013 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es oralement \u2013 et qui figurent \u00e0 la page 9) seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie du dossier de preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9 aura la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux documents des plaignantes qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B ainsi qu\u2019aux observations \u00e0 l\u2019appui, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019onglet 66. S\u2019il d\u00e9cide de profiter de cette possibilit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra aviser les parties et le Tribunal de son intention et de la forme que rev\u00eatira sa r\u00e9ponse avant le 21 janvier 2015 au plus tard, \u00e0 la suite de quoi l\u2019intim\u00e9 aura jusqu\u2019au 4 f\u00e9vrier 2015 pour pr\u00e9senter sa r\u00e9ponse.\n[19] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, AADNC a soumis des observations \u00e9crites au sujet des documents en question, selon lesquelles le Tribunal aux fins de se prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, ne devrait leur accorder qu\u2019une faible valeur probante ou aucune valeur probante. AADNC a \u00e9galement soumis un tableau r\u00e9sumant sa position sur chacun des documents.\n[20] Le Tribunal a tenu compte des observations formul\u00e9es par AADNC au sujet des documents faisant l\u2019objet de son ordonnance dans la d\u00e9cision 2015 TCDP 1. Il a \u00e9galement tenu compte des autres arguments soumis relativement \u00e0 la valeur probante \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ainsi que des observations des autres parties pour tirer les conclusions qui suivent.\nV. Analyse\n[21] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la pr\u00e9sente plainte all\u00e8gue que la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon est discriminatoire, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, que le financement de ces services par AADNC est in\u00e9quitable et insuffisant. Il incombe aux plaignantes de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve et de rencontrer leur fardeau de preuve de mani\u00e8re prima facie (\u00e0 sa face m\u00eame). La preuve prima facie est \u00ab celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons\u2011Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC), par. 28).\n[22] Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les plaignantes doivent, selon l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, d\u00e9montrer : (1) que les Premi\u00e8res Nations poss\u00e8dent une ou plusieurs caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es contre la discrimination; (2) qu\u2019AADNC les a priv\u00e9es de services ou les a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de ces services; (3) que la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es constitue(nt) un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans le refus des services ou de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore c. British Columbia (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, par. 33 [Moore]).\n[23] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est relativement simple : la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique sont des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. Il est admis que les Premi\u00e8res Nations poss\u00e8dent ces caract\u00e9ristiques.\n[24] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment requiert que les plaignantes d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019AADNC participe effectivement \u00e0 la fourniture de \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Dans l\u2019affirmative, elles doivent d\u00e9montrer que les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont priv\u00e9es de ces services, ou qu\u2019elles sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es du fait de la participation d\u2019AADNC \u00e0 la fourniture de ces services.\n[25] Troisi\u00e8mement, les plaignantes doivent d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab lien de causalit\u00e9 \u00bb, car les agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 peuvent s\u2019expliquer par diverses raisons. Autrement dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le motif de distinction illicite soit l\u2019unique mobile des agissements reproch\u00e9s pour que la plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que le motif de distinction illicite soit l\u2019un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 aux agissements reproch\u00e9s (Holden c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (CAF), par. 7; Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, par. 44 \u00e0 52 [Bombardier]).\n[26] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il convient de se rappeler que la discrimination n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas exerc\u00e9e ouvertement, ou m\u00eame intentionnellement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs de discrimination ou de l\u2019intention de discriminer pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP (Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP); Bombardier, par. 40 et 41).\n[27] AADNC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et ses propres arguments pour r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations de discrimination des plaignantes. Il n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 les exceptions pr\u00e9vues aux articles 15 et 16 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, la t\u00e2che du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 examiner l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties pour d\u00e9cider si les plaignantes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019existence des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs d\u2019un acte discriminatoire (Bombardier, par. 56 et 64; voir \u00e9galement Peel Law Association c. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, par. 80 \u00e0 90).\n[28] C\u2019est donc sous cet angle et en tenant compte de ces principes que le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la preuve et les arguments des parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019AADNC fournit des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. De plus, les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de ces services par AADNC et, dans certains cas, elles sont priv\u00e9es de ces services en raison de la participation d\u2019AADNC. Enfin, la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique constitue un facteur dans ce refus ainsi que dans les effets pr\u00e9judiciables subis lors des services offerts par AANDC.\nA. AADNC offre des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon\ni. Le terme \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP\n[29] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP dispose ce qui suit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[30] Selon le libell\u00e9 de cet article, les plaignantes doivent d\u00e9montrer que les actes reproch\u00e9s s\u2019inscrivent dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public. Le premier volet de l\u2019analyse requiert que l\u2019on d\u00e9finisse le sens du mot \u00ab services \u00bb en fonction des faits port\u00e9s \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal (Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 RCS 571, 1996 CanLII 231 (CSC), le juge La Forest, par. 68 [Gould]). En d\u2019autres termes, quel est l\u2019\u00ab avantage \u00bb ou l\u2019\u00ab aide \u00bb offert (Watkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2008 CAF 170, par. 31 [Watkin]; et, Gould, le juge La Forest, par. 55). Pour trancher cette question, \u00ab [i]l faut tenir compte des actes pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination pour pouvoir d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit de \u201cservices\u201d \u00bb (Watkin, par. 33). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il peut \u00eatre utile de se demander si l\u2019avantage ou l\u2019aide en question constitue la nature essentielle de l\u2019activit\u00e9 (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Pankiw, 2010 CF 555, par. 42).\n[31] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le service cr\u00e9e une relation publique entre le fournisseur du service et son utilisateur. Le fait que des mesures soient prises par un organisme public pour le bien du public n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant. En fait, aucun facteur n\u2019est \u00e0 lui seul d\u00e9terminant. Pour d\u00e9terminer si un service s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre d\u2019une \u00ab relation publique \u00bb, le Tribunal doit examiner tous les facteurs pertinents en fonction du contexte (Gould, le juge La Forest, par. 68; Watkin, par. 32 et 33). Pour tirer cette conclusion, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9finir le \u00ab public \u00bb auquel est offert le service. La d\u00e9finition du public est d\u2019ordre relationnel et non quantitatif. Autrement dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les clients \u00e0 qui le service est offert constituent l\u2019ensemble du public. Ils peuvent constituer un segment tr\u00e8s important ou tr\u00e8s restreint du \u00ab public \u00bb (University of British Columbia c. Berg, [1993] 2 RCS 353, p. 374 \u00e0 388; Gould, le juge La Forest, par. 68). Une relation publique est cr\u00e9\u00e9e d\u00e8s lors que le fournisseur de services offre un \u00ab service \u00bb au \u00ab public \u00bb en question (Gould, le juge La Forest, par. 55).\nii. \u00c9l\u00e9ments de preuve tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019AADNC offre un \u00ab service \u00bb\n[32] La Commission et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien qualifient le Programme des SEFPN, ses mod\u00e8les de financement et les ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, de services qui sont fournis par AADNC aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon.\n[33] En revanche, AADNC fait valoir que le r\u00f4le qu\u2019il joue dans la prestation de services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations se limite strictement au financement et \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 pour l\u2019emploi de ces fonds. Selon AADNC, le financement ne constitue pas un \u00ab service \u00bb. De plus, AADNC soutient que le financement qu\u2019il accorde n\u2019est pas \u00ab destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb. Il est fourni par un gouvernement \u00e0 un gouvernement ou par un gouvernement \u00e0 un organisme.\n[34] Selon AADNC, l\u2019avantage offert sous forme de service correspond aux services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance relevant des provinces, qui sont mis \u00e0 la disposition des Premi\u00e8res Nations par les organismes de SEFPN, par les provinces ou par les territoires. AADNC n\u2019exerce aucun contr\u00f4le sur les services et les programmes offerts. C\u2019est aux organismes, aux provinces et aux territoires qu\u2019il appartient de d\u00e9cider quels services seront offerts et selon quelles modalit\u00e9s. C\u2019est \u00e9galement \u00e0 eux qu\u2019il revient de d\u00e9terminer si la prestation des services est conforme ou non aux exigences l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, AADNC invoque l\u2019arr\u00eat NIL\/TU,O Child and Family Services Society c. B.C. Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union, 2010 CSC 45 (NIL\/TU,O), pour soutenir sa position que les services de protection de l\u2019enfance rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale. Il ajoute que ce n\u2019est que dans le cadre de ses politiques sociales qu\u2019il intervient dans la prestation des services offerts aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations et ce, en vertu de son pouvoir de d\u00e9penser. Selon AADNC, le financement qu\u2019il accorde ne change rien \u00e0 la nature provinciale\/territoriale des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[35] Comme il l\u2019explique dans les pages qui suivent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019AADNC fournit des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves partout au Canada et au Yukon. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, AADNC offre un avantage ou une aide en accordant un financement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00ab assurer \u00bb, \u00ab procurer \u00bb et \u00ab soutenir \u00bb ou visant \u00e0 les \u00ab mettre \u00e0 leur disposition \u00bb des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon,. L\u2019objectif du Programme des SEFPN est d\u2019assurer la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation et aux normes de la province ou du territoire en question. De plus ces services doivent \u00eatre fournis d\u2019une mani\u00e8re raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 ceux qui sont offerts aux r\u00e9sidents de la province ou du territoire dans des circonstances analogues, tout respectant les exigences des politiques du Programme. Cet aide ou cet avantage est offert \u00e0 titre de service par AADNC et, mis \u00e0 la disposition des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique.\na. Champ d\u2019application de la LCDP relativement aux activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC\n[36] L\u2019arr\u00eat NIL\/TU,O portait sur les relations de travail au sein d\u2019un organisme de SEFPN. Il s\u2019agissait de savoir si elles devaient \u00eatre r\u00e9glement\u00e9es par le gouvernement provincial ou par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Les relations de travail sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es relever de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que NIL\/TU,O \u00e9tait \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards un organisme d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance r\u00e9glement\u00e9 par la province. Ni le fait que cet organisme recevait du financement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, ni l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtone de ses clients et de ses employ\u00e9s, ni son mandat de fournir des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture de ses clients autochtones, n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s suffisants pour renverser la pr\u00e9somption voulant que les relations de travail rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale.\n[37] La pr\u00e9sente affaire soul\u00e8ve des questions de droits de la personne, dans le contexte des activit\u00e9s exerc\u00e9es par AADNC. Contrairement aux questions relatives aux relations de travail, il n\u2019y a pas de pr\u00e9somption \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les questions de droits de la personne rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale. La LCDP s\u2019applique aux questions relevant du \u00ab champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada \u00bb (LCDP, art. 2). Bien que les activit\u00e9s des organismes de SEFPN et des gouvernements provinciaux puissent relever de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale en ce qui concerne les relations de travail, cette pr\u00e9somption n\u2019a aucune incidence sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, dans le cas qui nous occupe, \u00e0 trancher relativement aux activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC.\n[38] La plainte vise, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC. AADNC est un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le Parlement en vertu de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien. AADNC tire son mandat de plusieurs lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, dont la Loi sur les Indiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, les mesures prises en vertu de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien par AADNC rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement et peuvent \u00eatre assujetties \u00e0 la LCDP.\n[39] Il ne s\u2019agit pas, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de d\u00e9terminer si les activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC sont en dehors du champ d\u2019application de la LCDP parce qu\u2019elles ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de savoir si la LCDP s\u2019applique aux activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC parce que les mesures qu\u2019il prend s\u2019inscrivent dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un service. Le fait que d\u2019autres acteurs, et notamment des acteurs provinciaux, puissent intervenir dans la prestation d\u2019un service n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant et ne permet pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 AADNC d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de son respect des droits de la personne (voir, par exemple, l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge c. Colombie-Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 RCS 624 [Eldridge]). Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il revient au Tribunal d\u2019examiner tous les facteurs pertinents pour d\u00e9terminer la nature et l\u2019ampleur de la participation d\u2019AADNC afin de conclure si cette participation est suffisamment importante pour \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nb. Le financement peut constituer un service\n[40] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, m\u00eame si le r\u00f4le que joue AADNC en mati\u00e8re de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations se limite au financement, on ne trouve rien dans la LCDP qui exclue le financement du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019article 5. Autrement dit, le financement peut constituer un service, si les faits et la preuve indiquent que le financement constitue un avantage ou une aide offert au public au sens des crit\u00e8res susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[41] Le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a, dans la d\u00e9cision Bitonti et al. c. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia et al., (1999) 36 CHRR D\/263 (TDPCB) (Bitonti), rejet\u00e9 un argument semblable \u00e0 celui qui est soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par AADNC. Dans cette affaire, les plaignants soutenaient, notamment, que le financement fourni par le minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 ne permettait pas v\u00e9ritablement aux dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s de la facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine d\u2019obtenir des stages. Le minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 avait r\u00e9pondu que la fa\u00e7on dont le gouvernement provincial d\u00e9pensait les fonds \u00e9tait une mesure l\u00e9gislative qui \u00e9chappait \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. En derni\u00e8re analyse, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas de relation de service entre le minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et les plaignants. N\u00e9anmoins, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 315, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter l\u2019argument du Minist\u00e8re qui pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri de tout examen de ses d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de financement :\n[traduction]\nPouss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame, cet argument signifierait, par exemple, que si le ministre de la Sant\u00e9 offrait du financement pour des stages, mais pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019il le r\u00e9servait aux stagiaires de sexe masculin, cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9chapperait \u00e0 tout contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 aller aussi loin.\n[42] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kelso c. La Reine, [1981] 1 RCS 199, \u00e0 la page 207 (Kelso), la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9crit ce qui suit (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original) :\nPersonne ne conteste le droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources et les effectifs comme il le juge appropri\u00e9. Mais ce droit n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9. Le droit du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources ne peut l\u2019emporter sur une loi telle que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[43] D\u2019ailleurs, la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re quasi constitutionnel de la LCDP \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises (voir, p. ex., Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 RCS 84, aux p. 89 et 90 (Robichaud); Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, par. 81 (Vaid); Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, par. 62 [Mowat]). La LCDP incarne des valeurs fondamentales et vise des objectifs fondamentaux de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, tels que le principe fondamental d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne (voir l\u2019article 2 de la LCDP; voir \u00e9galement Mowat, par. 33; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mossop, [1993] 1 RCS 554, p. 615, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9). Par cons\u00e9quent, la LCDP doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce statut sp\u00e9cial (Mowat, par. 62).\n[44] En revanche, toute exception \u00e0 l\u2019application de ses dispositions doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement (Vaid, par. 81). Ici encore, on ne trouve, ni dans la LCDP, ni ailleurs, rien qui permette de penser que le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral souhaitait que le financement \u00e9chappe \u00e0 un examen en vertu de la Loi, \u00e0 condition, bien entendu, qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le financement est un service. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Kelso, lorsque le gouvernement du Canada participe \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019un service, notamment lorsque ce service suppose la r\u00e9partition de fonds, ce service et la fa\u00e7on dont les ressources sont r\u00e9parties doivent respecter les principes des droits de la personne.\n[45] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal rejette l\u2019argument selon lequel le financement ne peut constituer un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Quoiqu\u2019il en soit, comme nous le verrons dans les pages qui suivent, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montre que la nature essentielle de l\u2019\u00ab assistance \u00bb ou de l\u2019\u00ab aide \u00bb qu\u2019AADNC offre, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ne se limite pas \u00e0 du simple financement.\nc. L\u2019\u00ab aide \u00bb ou \u00ab avantage \u00bb offert par AADNC\n[46] Le Programme des SEFPN d\u2019AADNC s\u2019applique aux organismes de SEFPN dans toutes les provinces, sauf l\u2019Ontario, et au Yukon. En Ontario, AADNC a conclu une entente de partage des co\u00fbts avec la province pour la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations. AADNC a \u00e9galement conclu des ententes avec les provinces de l\u2019Alberta et de la Colombie-Britannique pour offrir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans certaines r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Une entente semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue avec le Yukon. La prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest et au Nunavut n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[47] Le Programme des SEFPN a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019absence de prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille par les provinces dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Traditionnellement, l\u2019aide aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et \u00e0 leur famille \u00e9tait fournie de mani\u00e8re informelle, selon les coutumes des bandes et au sein du r\u00e9seau de la famille \u00e9largie. Toutefois, avec le temps, cette aide informelle est devenue insuffisante pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants et des familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[48] De 1946 \u00e0 1948 et, plus tard, de 1959 \u00e0 1961, les comit\u00e9s mixtes du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes ont encourag\u00e9 les provinces et les territoires \u00e0 s\u2019engager plus activement dans la prestation de services aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, afin de combler les lacunes caus\u00e9es par les bouleversements survenus dans les pratiques traditionnelles associ\u00e9es aux services communautaires. Toutefois, les gouvernements provinciaux \u00e9taient r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 offrir de tels services pour des raisons d\u2019ordre financier et en raison de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur \u00ab [l]es Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb en vertu du paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Cette situation a entra\u00een\u00e9 des disparit\u00e9s d\u2019une province \u00e0 l\u2019autre quant \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 des services offerts aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. En effet, certaines provinces ne fournissaient des services que si elles \u00e9taient indemnis\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou uniquement dans des situations de vie ou de mort (annexe, pi\u00e8ce 2, p. 39 [l\u2019EPN]).\n[49] En 1965, le Canada a conclu avec la province de l\u2019Ontario une entente lui permettant d\u2019offrir des services sociaux, et notamment des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves. D\u2019autres provinces ont sign\u00e9 des ententes bilat\u00e9rales aux termes desquelles AADNC s\u2019engageait \u00e0 les rembourser en contrepartie de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille (annexe, pi\u00e8ce 3, art. 1.1.2 \u2011 1.1.3 [Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005)]).\n[50] Au cours des ann\u00e9es soixante\u2011dix et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es quatre-vingt, les services offerts par la province aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 susciter des inqui\u00e9tudes. Les pr\u00e9occupations \u00e9taient que les services \u00e9taient insuffisants, qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture autochtone et qu\u2019un nombre alarmant d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9taient retir\u00e9s de leur collectivit\u00e9. Cette situation a suscit\u00e9 un mouvement vers la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019organismes de SEFPN propres aux collectivit\u00e9s. AADNC a financ\u00e9 ces organismes par l\u2019entremise d\u2019arrangements sp\u00e9ciaux, mais les autorit\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas claires et le financement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas constant (EPN, p. 24).\n[51] En 1986, AADNC a impos\u00e9 un moratoire sur les arrangements sp\u00e9ciaux pour le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019organismes de SEFPN. Ce moratoire s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019en 1990, quand AADNC a adopt\u00e9 le Programme des SEFPN (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), article 1.1.6 et EPN, p. 24).\n[52] L\u2019article 1.3 du Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), \u00e9nonce les objectifs et les principes du Programme des SEFPN, et notamment les suivants :\n1.3.2 Le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations s\u2019adresse aux enfants indiens et \u00e0 leurs familles qui vivent ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve. Il vise principalement \u00e0 offrir, dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant, des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, dans le respect des lois et des normes de la province ou du territoire en cause.\n[\u2026]\n1.3.4 Les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations seront administr\u00e9s et g\u00e9r\u00e9s par des organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations (b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires) mandat\u00e9s par la province ou le territoire. Ils sont offerts aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res nations qui vivent ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires veilleront \u00e0 administrer le programme selon les lois et les normes provinciales ou territoriales. Quant \u00e0 AINC, il fournira les fonds n\u00e9cessaires conform\u00e9ment aux autorisations qui lui sont accord\u00e9es.\n1.3.5 Les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis dans les r\u00e9serves doivent \u00eatre adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture et \u00eatre comparables, sans \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement identiques, \u00e0 ceux que la province ou le territoire en cause offre \u00e0 la population vivant en dehors de la r\u00e9serve dans des conditions semblables.\n1.3.6 Les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ont comme objectif premier de veiller \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les enfants contre la n\u00e9gligence et les mauvais traitements. Ils visent \u00e0 donner aux familles des Premi\u00e8res nations la capacit\u00e9 de rester r\u00e9unies et de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants dans leur foyer et dans leur collectivit\u00e9.\n1.3.7 Les organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations et les autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires s\u2019assureront que toutes les personnes qui vivent ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve et qui se trouvent dans leur zone desservie re\u00e7oivent un \u00e9ventail complet de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.

Toutefois, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, deux employ\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC ont expliqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Minist\u00e8re de ne pas transf\u00e9rer le Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 la nouvelle m\u00e9thode de financement. Voici ce qu\u2019ils expliquent dans le document intitul\u00e9 Reform of FNCFS Program in Qu\u00e9bec (Information for the Deputy Minister), aux pages 1 \u00e0 3 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 12) :\n[traduction]\nAINC est en pourparlers avec la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Qu\u00e9bec et du Labrador et le minist\u00e8re qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services sociaux depuis juin 2007 au sujet de la transition, par les organismes de SEFPN du Qu\u00e9bec, vers l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention.\nLes trois parties ont \u00e9labor\u00e9 un Cadre de partenariat ax\u00e9 sur les r\u00e9sultats, qui d\u00e9finit des orientations strat\u00e9giques, des buts cl\u00e9s et des indicateurs de r\u00e9ussite du Programme des SEFPN pour les r\u00e9serves du Qu\u00e9bec. Les repr\u00e9sentants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et du Qu\u00e9bec ont soumis des lettres d\u2019appui \u00e0 cette initiative.\nEn novembre 2007, la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Qu\u00e9bec et du Labrador a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions portant essentiellement sur le mod\u00e8le de financement propos\u00e9 pour les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Qu\u00e9bec (voir l\u2019Annexe A pour une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es et des mesures que nous proposons).\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en d\u00e9cembre 2007, d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant dans la transition vers l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention sans le Qu\u00e9bec, afin de donner au Minist\u00e8re le temps de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par les Premi\u00e8res Nations au sujet du processus de transition.\nLe Minist\u00e8re n\u2019a pas encore inform\u00e9 les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Qu\u00e9bec et la province de Qu\u00e9bec de sa d\u00e9cision de reporter, dans le cas du Qu\u00e9bec, la transition vers l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention.\n[\u2026]\nIl se peut qu\u2019une fois inform\u00e9es de la d\u00e9cision, la Commission et les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Qu\u00e9bec refusent de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la transition vers l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention. Nous esp\u00e9rons que la d\u00e9cision sera communiqu\u00e9e par un haut fonctionnaire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rassurer les Premi\u00e8res Nations quant \u00e0 l\u2019engagement du Minist\u00e8re et \u00e0 permettre aux personnel de niveau op\u00e9rationnel de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es et de favoriser la transition.\n[74] Ce document \u00e9nonce une position officielle que doit adopter le sous\u2011ministre d\u2019AADNC apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par des hauts fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC. Il illustre le fait que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019une relation tripartite dont les partenaires appuient l\u2019existence d\u2019une nouvelle formule de financement, AADNC est l\u2019entit\u00e9 qui contr\u00f4le le processus et prend la d\u00e9cision finale lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer la marche \u00e0 suivre.\n[75] De plus, AADNC a le pouvoir de retenir des fonds si les organismes de SEFPN ou les provinces et les territoires ne respectent pas les conditions du financement. Ce genre de mesure pourrait forcer des organismes \u00e0 fermer leurs portes et faire en sorte que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon ne re\u00e7oivent pas de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ad\u00e9quats (t\u00e9moignage de William McArthur, directeur des Programmes sociaux, Bureau r\u00e9gional de la Colombie-Britannique, AADNC, Transcription, vol. 64, p. 45 \u00e0 47).\n[76] Il ressort de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de qu\u2019il existe une relation publique entre AADNC et les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. En somme, AADNC pr\u00e9sente le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes comme un partenariat, notamment avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, pour am\u00e9liorer la situation des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. En derni\u00e8re analyse, par l\u2019entremise du Programme des SEFPN, de ses mod\u00e8les de financement et des ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, AADNC a une influence directe sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille qui sont offerts aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon.\n[77] Cette relation publique entre AADNC et les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille est renforc\u00e9e par les obligations constitutionnelles du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et par la relation sp\u00e9ciale que ce dernier entretient avec les peuples autochtones.\ne. Le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867\n[78] AADNC n\u2019offre pas directement de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, mais il finance la prestation de ces services par l\u2019entremise d\u2019organismes de SEFPN ou des gouvernements provinciaux ou territoriaux. Cela ne le dispense pas pour autant de son obligation de respecter sa mission publique et ses obligations envers les peuples autochtones. AADNC soutient que les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale. Il ajoute que ce n\u2019est que dans le cadre de l\u2019administration de ses politiques sociales qu\u2019il est intervenu, pour r\u00e9pondre aux craintes en r\u00e9ponse au fait que les provinces n\u2019offrent pas toute la gamme des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Toutefois, cette position ne tient pas compte de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative exclusive que le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 conf\u00e8re au Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur les \u00ab Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb.\n[79] Au Canada, les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs sont partag\u00e9s entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux. Comme il fut dit par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest c. Alberta, 2007 CSC 22, au paragraphe 22 (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest) :\n[\u2026] le f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme a \u00e9t\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse juridique des constituants aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s politiques et culturelles qui existaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Il repr\u00e9sentait ainsi une reconnaissance juridique de la diversit\u00e9 des premiers membres de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Le partage des comp\u00e9tences qui en repr\u00e9sente l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux visait \u00e0 respecter cette diversit\u00e9 au sein d\u2019une m\u00eame nation. De larges pouvoirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, tandis que l\u2019unit\u00e9 du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e en r\u00e9servant au Parlement les pouvoirs dont l\u2019exercice se pr\u00eatait davantage \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du pays. Chacune des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gislatives a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de gouvernement qui serait le mieux plac\u00e9 pour l\u2019exercer. Le f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme avait, et a toujours, pour objectifs fondamentaux de concilier l\u2019unit\u00e9 et la diversit\u00e9, de promouvoir la participation d\u00e9mocratique en r\u00e9servant des pouvoirs r\u00e9els aux instances locales ou r\u00e9gionales, ainsi que de favoriser la coop\u00e9ration des diff\u00e9rents gouvernements et l\u00e9gislatures dans la recherche du bien commun.\n[80] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ces comp\u00e9tences et de leur articulation doit \u00eatre \u00e9volutive et adapt\u00e9e aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s politiques et culturelles changeantes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne \u00bb (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 23). C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle la doctrine de \u00ab l\u2019arbre vivant \u00bb.\n[81] Les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs d\u00e9finis dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre exclusifs \u00e0 tel point que m\u00eame si le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne l\u00e9gif\u00e8re pas dans un des domaines relevant de sa comp\u00e9tence, les provinces et les territoires ne peuvent le faire \u00e0 sa place (Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia c. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580 (C.P.), p. 588). Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la doctrine de l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 des comp\u00e9tences doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re restrictive, notamment pour \u00e9viter de cr\u00e9er un \u00ab vide juridique \u00bb. Cette doctrine sert \u00ab [...] \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de certains ouvrages ou d\u2019entreprises, de choses (p. ex. les terres autochtones) ou de personnes (p. ex. les Autochtones et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 41) \u00bb. Tel que la Cour l\u2019a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, au paragraphe 42 :\nLa vie du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme canadien ne se r\u00e9duit pas qu\u2019\u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes juridiques. Si elle reste un document juridique, la Constitution fournit un cadre de vie et d\u2019action politique \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019un \u00c9tat f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dans lequel les tribunaux ont l\u00e9gitimement observ\u00e9 l\u2019importance que pr\u00e9sente la coop\u00e9ration des acteurs gouvernementaux pour la souplesse du fonctionnement du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme.\n[82] Malgr\u00e9 la doctrine de l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 des comp\u00e9tences, un f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif peut exister lorsque les comp\u00e9tences f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales se chevauchent. Dans l\u2019affaire Qu\u00e9bec (P.G.) c. Canada (P.G.), 2015 CSC 14 (l\u2019affaire du Registre canadien des armes \u00e0 feu), dans laquelle le Qu\u00e9bec contestait la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de d\u00e9truire le registre des armes \u00e0 feu, la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est divis\u00e9e sur le principe du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif. N\u00e9anmoins, la majorit\u00e9 a jug\u00e9 que le principe du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif ne pouvait outrepasser ou modifier le partage des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus par la Constitution :\n[17] La notion de f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif sert \u00e0 d\u00e9crire le [traduction] \u00ab faisceau de rapports entre l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du gouvernement central et celui des gouvernements r\u00e9gionaux [au moyen duquel] des m\u00e9canismes, tout particuli\u00e8rement des m\u00e9canismes financiers, sont \u00e9tablis pour permettre une r\u00e9partition continuelle des pouvoirs et des ressources sans recourir aux tribunaux ou \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019amendement \u00bb : P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), p. 5-46; voir aussi W. R. Lederman, \u00ab Some Forms and Limitations of Co-Operative Federalism \u00bb, dans Continuing Canadian Constitutional Dilemmas (1981), 314. Les tribunaux se sont servis de cette notion descriptive de f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif pour \u00e9laborer un principe juridique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 pour assouplir les doctrines touchant le partage des pouvoirs telles la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 des comp\u00e9tences. Elle est utilis\u00e9e pour faciliter l\u2019int\u00e9gration des r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux et \u00e9viter l\u2019imposition de contraintes inutiles aux interventions l\u00e9gislatives provinciales : voir, p. ex., Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest c. Alberta, 2007 CSC 22, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 24 et 43; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019organisation du march\u00e9 des produits agricoles, [1978] 2 R.C.S. 1198; F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des producteurs de volailles du Qu\u00e9bec c. Pelland, 2005 CSC 20, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 292, par. 15; Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 CSC 39, [2010] 2 R.C.S. 536, par. 44-45; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 CSC 44, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 134, par. 63. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 des comp\u00e9tences, par exemple, on a employ\u00e9 le principe du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif pour expliquer et justifier l\u2019assouplissement d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation, stricte et fond\u00e9e sur des compartiments \u00e9tanches, du partage des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gislatives qui restreint inutilement l\u2019intervention l\u00e9gislative de l\u2019autre ordre de gouvernement : \u00ab En l\u2019absence de textes l\u00e9gislatifs conflictuels de la part de l\u2019autre ordre de gouvernement, la Cour devrait \u00e9viter d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019application de mesures consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es en vue de favoriser l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 37).\n[18] Toutefois, nous devons \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre les limites du principe du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif. La primaut\u00e9 de notre Constitution \u00e9crite demeure l\u2019un des pr\u00e9ceptes fondamentaux de notre r\u00e9gime constitutionnel : Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession du Qu\u00e9bec, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 217, par. 53. Cela est tout particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans le cas du partage des comp\u00e9tences :\n[traduction] . . . le texte de la constitution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 p\u00e9remptoirement par les tribunaux reste tr\u00e8s important. Il nous dit qui peut agir, quelle que soit la situation. Autrement dit, sur le plan constitutionnel, il doit toujours \u00eatre possible dans un pays f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de se poser la question \u00ab Que se passe-t-il si les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux ne s\u2019entendent pas sur une mesure de coop\u00e9ration en particulier? \u00bb et d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. Alors quel gouvernement et quel organe l\u00e9gislatif ont le pouvoir de faire quoi?\n[Nous soulignons; note de bas de page omise.]\n[83] Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pouvait l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer dans le domaine de la protection de l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations en vertu du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif exclusif sur les \u00ab Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux Indiens \u00bb que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Il a plut\u00f4t abord\u00e9 la question sous l\u2019angle de l\u2019\u00e9laboration de programmes et du financement. Il a permis l\u2019application des lois et des normes provinciales en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en adoptant l\u2019article 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Toutefois, cette approche, fond\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois sur la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation et sur l\u2019\u00e9laboration de programmes et le financement, ne diminue en rien les obligations constitutionnelles d\u2019AADNC. Dans une situation comparable mettant en cause la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte), la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 42 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge :\n[\u2026] la Charte s\u2019applique aux entit\u00e9s priv\u00e9es, dans la mesure o\u00f9 celles\u2011ci agissent en vue de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019un programme d\u00e9termin\u00e9 du gouvernement. Dans de telles circonstances, m\u00eame si c\u2019est un acteur priv\u00e9 qui ex\u00e9cute effectivement le programme, le gouvernement en conserve n\u00e9anmoins la responsabilit\u00e9. La justification de ce principe est facile \u00e0 discerner. Tout comme il est interdit aux gouvernements de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte en concluant des contrats commerciaux ou d\u2019autres accords \u00ab priv\u00e9s \u00bb, ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00e9chapper \u00e0 leurs obligations constitutionnelles en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant la mise en \u0153uvre de leurs politiques et programmes \u00e0 des entit\u00e9s priv\u00e9es.\n[84] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, on ne devrait pas permettre \u00e0 AADNC d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 ses obligations envers les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant la mise en \u0153uvre des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux organismes de SEFPN, ou aux provinces et aux territoires. On ne devrait pas permettre \u00e0 AADNC d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 l\u2019examen fond\u00e9 sur la LCDP parce qu\u2019il ne fournit pas directement de services aux enfants et aux familles vivant dans des r\u00e9serves.\n[85] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il ne mette pas concr\u00e8tement de services en \u0153uvre, AADNC exerce une influence importante sur la prestation des services en question. C\u2019est en fin de compte AADNC qui a le pouvoir de corriger les lacunes dans la prestation des services aux enfants et aux familles ainsi que d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la situation des enfants et des familles r\u00e9sidant dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations et au Yukon. Voil\u00e0 en quoi consiste l\u2019aide ou l\u2019avantage qu\u2019AADNC offre et qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de procurer aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[86] L\u2019obligation constitutionnelle du Parlement envers les peuples autochtones, se situe dans un contexte o\u00f9 un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral responsable des affaires autochtones supervise un programme social, n\u00e9gocie et administre des ententes au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Elle renforce la relation publique qui existe entre AADNC et les Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le contexte du Programme des SEFPN et des ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes.\nf. La relation de fiduciaire de la Couronne envers les peuples autochtones\n[87] En outre, l\u2019engagement d\u2019AADNC d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants et des familles vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 dans le contexte de la relation sp\u00e9ciale qui existe entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones.\n[88] Les plaignantes soulignent que la relation qui existe entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones est de nature fiduciaire et donne lieu \u00e0 une obligation de fiduciaire dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN. AANDC reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il existe une relation de fiduciaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entre la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les peuples autochtones du Canada, cependant il soutient que les principes de l\u2019obligation de fiduciaire ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00e0 la plainte.\n[89] Il est de jurisprudence constante que, dans tous ses rapports avec les peuples autochtones, la Couronne doit agir honorablement (Nation Ha\u00efda c. Colombie-Britannique (Ministre des For\u00eats), 2004 CSC 73, par. 16 [Nation Ha\u00efda]) et il est \u00e9galement de jurisprudence constante qu\u2019il existe entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones du Canada une relation sp\u00e9ciale qui est qualifi\u00e9e de relation sui generis. Cette relation sp\u00e9ciale d\u00e9coule du fait que les peuples autochtones se trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en Am\u00e9rique du Nord \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des Europ\u00e9ens (R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 RCS 507, par. 30).\n[90] En 1950, dans une affaire portant sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 51 de la Loi des sauvages de 1906 et des terres de r\u00e9serves, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le soin et le bien-\u00eatre des peuples autochtones constituaient [traduction] \u00ab une fiducie politique comportant les plus hautes obligations \u00bb :\n[traduction]\nLe texte de la loi renferme la notion accept\u00e9e que ces aborig\u00e8nes sont, en fait, des pupilles de l\u2019\u00c9tat dont le soin et le bien-\u00eatre constituent une fiducie politique comportant les plus hautes obligations. Pour cette raison, toute op\u00e9ration portant sur les privil\u00e8ges des aborig\u00e8nes doit porter l\u2019empreinte de l\u2019approbation gouvernementale et il serait en dehors de la comp\u00e9tence du gouverneur en conseil de transf\u00e9rer cette responsabilit\u00e9 au surintendant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n(St. Ann\u2019s Island Shooting And Fishing Club c. The King, [1950] SCR 211, p. 219 [le juge Rand])\n[91] Toutefois, cette \u00ab fiducie politique \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ex\u00e9cutoire devant les tribunaux. La situation a chang\u00e9 lorsque la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9e de la notion de fiducie politique. Dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire portant sur la vente de terres c\u00e9d\u00e9es, \u00e0 des conditions tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de celles convenues au moment de la cession, la Cour supr\u00eame a, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Guerin c. La Reine, [1984] 2 RCS 335, \u00e0 la page 376 (Guerin), qualifi\u00e9 le rapport existant entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones de rapport fiduciaire :\nLe rapport fiduciaire entre Sa Majest\u00e9 et les Indiens d\u00e9coule du concept du titre aborig\u00e8ne, autochtone ou indien. Cependant, le fait que les bandes indiennes poss\u00e8dent un certain droit sur des terres n'engendre pas en soi un rapport fiduciaire entre les Indiens et Sa Majest\u00e9. Pour conclure que Sa Majest\u00e9 est fiduciaire, il faut aussi que le droit des Indiens sur les terres soit inali\u00e9nable, sauf dans le cas d'une cession \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9.\n[92] Ce rapport sp\u00e9cial d\u00e9coule \u00e9galement, dans une large mesure, du contr\u00f4le discr\u00e9tionnaire exerc\u00e9 par la Couronne sur la vie et les droits des peuples autochtones au Canada :\nLe droit anglais, qui a fini par r\u00e9gir les droits des peuples autochtones, acceptait que les Autochtones poss\u00e9daient des lois et des int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9existants, et reconnaissait leur maintien s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9teints par la cession, la conqu\u00eate ou la loi : voir par exemple la Proclamation royale de 1763, L.R.C. 1985, App. II, no 1, et R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1075, p. 1103. Parall\u00e8lement, toutefois, Sa Majest\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 sa souverainet\u00e9 sur le territoire, et son titre sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce territoire : Sparrow, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Cette affirmation de souverainet\u00e9 a fait na\u00eetre l\u2019obligation de traiter les peuples autochtones de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et honorable, et de les prot\u00e9ger contre l\u2019exploitation, une obligation qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00ab obligation de fiduciaire \u00bb dans Guerin c. La Reine, [1984] 2 R.C.S. 335.\n(Mitchell c. M.R.N., 2001 CSC 33, par. 9)\n[93] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, la Cour supr\u00eame a de nouveau confirm\u00e9 et d\u00e9fini l\u2019obligation de la Couronne d\u2019agir en qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire en tant que \u00ab principe directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00bb de l\u2019article 35, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 RCS 1075, \u00e0 la page 1108 :\n\u00c0 notre avis, l'arr\u00eat Guerin, conjugu\u00e9 avec l'arr\u00eat R. v. Taylor and Williams (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 360, justifie un principe directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'interpr\u00e9tation du par. 35(1), savoir, le gouvernement a la responsabilit\u00e9 d'agir en qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des peuples autochtones. Les rapports entre le gouvernement et les autochtones sont de nature fiduciaire plut\u00f4t que contradictoire et la reconnaissance et la confirmation contemporaines des droits ancestraux doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9finies en fonction de ces rapports historiques.\n[94] Ce principe directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne se limite pas au paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Il a une port\u00e9e plus large encore, comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bande indienne Wewaykum c. Canada, 2002 CSC 79, au paragraphe 79 (Wewaykum).\n[95] Les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves entretiennent des rapports fiduciaires avec AADNC. Dans la mise en \u0153uvre du Programme des SEFPN, de ses mod\u00e8les de financement et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 et des pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires assum\u00e9s par la Couronne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard [des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves] sur les plans \u00e9conomique, social et foncier a \u00e9galement eu pour effet d\u2019exposer ces populations aux risques de faute et d\u2019ineptie de la part de la Couronne \u00bb (Wewaykum, par. 80). Ce rapport fiduciaire doit faire partie de l\u2019analyse du Tribunal, avec le principal corollaire selon lequel, dans tous ses rapports avec les peuples autochtones, l\u2019honneur de la Couronne est toujours en jeu. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nation Ha\u00efda, au paragraphe 17 :\nIl s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du minimum requis pour parvenir \u00e0 \u00ab concilier la pr\u00e9existence des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones et la souverainet\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00bb : Delgamuukw, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 186, citant Van der Peet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 31.\n[96] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, il est \u00e9galement de jurisprudence constante que ce rapport fiduciaire ne donne pas toujours lieu \u00e0 des obligations de fiduciaire. Bien que le rapport fiduciaire puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de rapport de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale obligeant la Couronne \u00e0 agir dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des peuples autochtones, les obligations de fiduciaire sont sp\u00e9cifiques et se rapportent \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones particuliers :\nL\u2019aspect positif de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de ces rapports sui generis fut, historiquement, la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats des peuples autochtones [\u2026]\nL\u2019\u00ab obligation de fiduciaire \u00bb est toutefois assortie de limites. Les appelantes semblent parfois invoquer cette obligation comme si elle imposait \u00e0 la Couronne une responsabilit\u00e9 totale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les aspects des rapports entre la Couronne et les bandes indiennes. C\u2019est aller trop loin. L\u2019obligation de fiduciaire incombant \u00e0 la Couronne n\u2019a pas un caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais existe plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de droits particuliers des Indiens.\n(Wewaykum, par. 80 et 81)\n[97] La Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur des concepts de droit priv\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9ciser les circonstances pouvant donner lieu \u00e0 une obligation de fiduciaire. En effet, bien que l\u2019obligation de la Couronne ne soit pas une obligation de droit priv\u00e9, elle est n\u00e9anmoins de la nature d\u2019une obligation priv\u00e9e et elle est susceptible de donner lieu \u00e0 des obligations ex\u00e9cutoires :\nIl nous faut remarquer que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il n'existe d'obligations de fiduciaire que dans le cas d'obligations prenant naissance dans un contexte de droit priv\u00e9. Les obligations de droit public dont l'acquittement n\u00e9cessite l'exercice d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne cr\u00e9ent normalement aucun rapport fiduciaire. Comme il se d\u00e9gage d'ailleurs des d\u00e9cisions portant sur les \u00ab fiducies politiques \u00bb, on ne pr\u00eate pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 la qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire lorsque celle-ci exerce ses fonctions l\u00e9gislatives ou administratives. Cependant, ce n'est pas parce que c'est \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 qu'incombe l'obligation d'agir pour le compte des Indiens que cette obligation \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du principe fiduciaire. Comme nous l'avons soulign\u00e9 plus haut, le droit des Indiens sur leurs terres a une existence juridique ind\u00e9pendante. Il ne doit son existence ni au pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ni au pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif. L'obligation qu'a Sa Majest\u00e9 envers les Indiens en ce qui concerne ce droit n'est donc pas une obligation de droit public. Bien qu'il ne s'agisse pas non plus d'une obligation de droit priv\u00e9 au sens strict, elle tient n\u00e9anmoins de la nature d'une obligation de droit priv\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, on peut \u00e0 bon droit, dans le contexte de ce rapport sui generis, consid\u00e9rer Sa Majest\u00e9 comme un fiduciaire.\n(Guerin, p. 385)\n[98] L\u2019arr\u00eat Guerin confirme le principe selon lequel une obligation de fiduciaire de la Couronne envers les peuples autochtones d\u00e9coule du fait que les int\u00e9r\u00eats fonciers autochtones ne peuvent \u00eatre ali\u00e9n\u00e9s qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la Couronne. Dans une autre affaire dans laquelle elle a conclu que la Couronne avait l\u2019obligation de fiduciaire d\u2019emp\u00eacher les transactions abusives dans le contexte de la cession de terres de r\u00e9serve, l\u2019affaire Bande indienne de la rivi\u00e8re Blueberry c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1995] 4 RCS 344, au paragraphe 38, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait appel \u00e0 des crit\u00e8res du droit priv\u00e9 pour d\u00e9finir une situation pouvant donner lieu \u00e0 une obligation de fiduciaire :\nEn r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une obligation de fiduciaire prend naissance lorsqu'une personne poss\u00e8de un pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral ou discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une question touchant une autre personne \u00ab particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rable \u00bb : voir Frame c. Smith, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 99; Norberg c. Wynrib, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 226, et Hodgkinson c. Simms, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 377. La partie vuln\u00e9rable est tributaire de la partie qui poss\u00e8de le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral ou discr\u00e9tionnaire, qui, \u00e0 son tour, est oblig\u00e9e d'exercer ce pouvoir uniquement au profit de la partie vuln\u00e9rable. La personne qui c\u00e8de (ou, plus souvent, qui se trouve dans la situation o\u00f9 quelqu'un d'autre a c\u00e9d\u00e9 pour elle) son pouvoir sur quelque chose \u00e0 une autre personne escompte que la personne \u00e0 qui le pouvoir en question est c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'exercera avec loyaut\u00e9 et diligence. Cette notion est la pierre d'assise de l'obligation de fiduciaire.\n[99] La pr\u00e9sente affaire ne soul\u00e8ve pas de questions fonci\u00e8res. Le Tribunal est conscient que la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas encore reconnu l\u2019existence d\u2019obligations de fiduciaire en ce qui concerne d\u2019autres droits autochtones que les droits fonciers en dehors du cadre du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (Wewaykum, par. 81). Toutefois, le Tribunal est \u00e9galement conscient que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Frame c. Smith, [1987] 2 RCS 99, au paragraphe 60, la juge Wilson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les obligations de fiduciaire s\u2019appliquaient non seulement aux int\u00e9r\u00eats juridiques et \u00e9conomiques, mais qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00e9galement s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats humains et personnels :\nRefuser un redressement en raison de la nature d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat vis\u00e9, accorder protection \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats mat\u00e9riels, mais non \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats humains et personnels serait, \u00e0 mon avis, extr\u00eamement arbitraire.\n[100] D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wewaykum, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 que, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Guerin, l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation fiduciaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e dans de nombreuses affaires soulevant diverses questions (par. 82). Bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas \u00e9mis d\u2019observations au sujet de ces affaires, la Cour a, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wewaykum, au paragraphe 83, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait adopter une approche au cas par cas, centr\u00e9e sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers en litige. Il faut \u00e9galement se demander si la Couronne exer\u00e7ait ou non un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire suffisant pour faire na\u00eetre une obligation de fiduciaire :\nIl convient selon moi que la Cour confirme le principe, mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, selon lequel les obligations liant des parties ayant des rapports fiduciaires n\u2019ont pas toutes un caract\u00e8re fiduciaire [\u2026] et que ce principe s\u2019applique aux rapports entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019attacher \u00e0 l\u2019obligation ou droit particulier qui est l\u2019objet du diff\u00e9rend et de se demander si la Couronne exer\u00e7ait ou non \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire suffisant pour faire na\u00eetre une obligation de fiduciaire.\n[101] La jurisprudence r\u00e9cente de la Cour supr\u00eame confirme qu\u2019une obligation de fiduciaire peut \u00e9galement d\u00e9couler d\u2019un engagement. Les conditions suivantes doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies :\nEn bref, pour prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation fiduciaire ad hoc, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer, en plus de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant du rapport d\u00e9crit par la juge Wilson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Frame : (1) un engagement de la part du fiduciaire \u00e0 agir au mieux des int\u00e9r\u00eats du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires; (2) l\u2019existence d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019un groupe de personnes d\u00e9finies vuln\u00e9rables au contr\u00f4le du fiduciaire (le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires); et (3) un int\u00e9r\u00eat juridique ou un int\u00e9r\u00eat pratique important du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires sur lequel l\u2019exercice, par le fiduciaire, de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ou de son contr\u00f4le pourrait avoir une incidence d\u00e9favorable.\n(Alberta c. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 CSC 24, par. 36 (Elder Advocates Society); voir \u00e9galement Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, par. 50 [Manitoba Metis Federation])\n[102] AADNC soutient que, pour qu\u2019il y ait obligation de fiduciaire, la Couronne doit avoir pris l\u2019engagement d\u2019agir avec loyaut\u00e9 au point de renoncer aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de toutes les autres parties en faveur de ceux des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires (Elder Advocates Society, par. 31; Manitoba Metis Federation, par. 61).\n[103] Il convient toutefois de signaler que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Elder Advocates Society, au paragraphe 48, la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que les conditions de l\u2019engagement \u00e9taient remplies en ce qui concerne les peuples autochtones :\nEn somme, bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas impossible pour un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019\u00c9tat de remplir les conditions d\u2019un engagement qu\u2019il a pris, ce sera rarement le cas. Ces conditions sont remplies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des peuples autochtones compte tenu des obligations que la Proclamation royale de 1763 (reproduite dans L.R.C. 1985, app. II, no 1) et la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 imposent au gouvernement et des facteurs semblables \u00e0 ceux que l\u2019on trouve dans le secteur priv\u00e9.\n[104] Vu ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et compte tenu de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sur cette question, les rapports qui existent entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le contexte de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves pourraient donner lieu \u00e0 une obligation de fiduciaire pour la Couronne. On peut soutenir que les trois crit\u00e8res d\u00e9finis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Elder Advocates Society ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[105] Le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris par la Couronne et elle les contr\u00f4le. Cet engagement est explicitement cens\u00e9 \u00eatre dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des Premi\u00e8res Nations b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et notamment, dans \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants \u00bb dont la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre sont des objectifs du programme. La Couronne exerce un contr\u00f4le discr\u00e9tionnaire sur le Programme des SEFPN par l\u2019entremise de ses politiques et d\u2019autres directives administratives. Elle exerce \u00e9galement un contr\u00f4le discr\u00e9tionnaire sur l\u2019application des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019ont pas pris part aux n\u00e9gociations. Le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes ont \u00e9galement des r\u00e9percussions directes sur un groupe de personnes vuln\u00e9rables : les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ont besoin de services de soutien dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[106] L\u2019exercice, par AANDC, de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de son contr\u00f4le sur le Programme des SEFPN, ainsi que sur les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, risque d\u2019avoir une incidence d\u00e9favorable sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats juridiques ainsi que sur des int\u00e9r\u00eats pratiques importants des enfants, des familles et des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Le Tribunal convient avec l\u2019APN, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et COO que les int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones pr\u00e9cis risquant de subir une incidence d\u00e9favorable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont la culture et les langues autochtones, ainsi que leur transmission de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Ces int\u00e9r\u00eats sont \u00e9galement prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. La transmission de la langue et des cultures autochtones est un droit ancestral g\u00e9n\u00e9rique que poss\u00e8dent tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et leur famille. D\u2019ailleurs, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance de la transmission culturelle dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. C\u00f4t\u00e9, [1996] 3 RCS 139, au paragraphe 56 :\nDans la tradition autochtone, les coutumes, pratiques et traditions sociales sont transmises de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ration au moyen de descriptions orales et de d\u00e9monstrations pratiques. En cons\u00e9quence, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 assurer la continuit\u00e9 des coutumes, pratiques et traditions autochtones, un droit ancestral substantiel emportera normalement le droit accessoire d\u2019enseigner cette coutume, pratique ou tradition aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations qui suivent.\n[107] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Doucet\u2011Boudreau c. Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9ducation), 2003 CSC 62, au paragraphe 26 (Doucet\u2011Boudreau), la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet du rapport qui existe entre la langue et la culture :\nLa Cour a affirm\u00e9, \u00e0 maintes reprises, qu\u2019il existait un lien \u00e9troit entre la langue et la culture. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mahe, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, p. 362, le juge en chef Dickson \u00e9crit :\n. . . toute garantie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de droits linguistiques, surtout dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, est indissociable d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la culture v\u00e9hicul\u00e9e par la langue en question. Une langue est plus qu\u2019un simple moyen de communication; elle fait partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de la culture du peuple qui la parle. C\u2019est le moyen par lequel les individus se comprennent eux\u2011m\u00eames et comprennent le milieu dans lequel ils vivent.\n[108] Dans le jugement Brown c. Canada (AG), 2013 ONSC 5637, au paragraphe 44, le juge Belobaba de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario a exprim\u00e9 son opinion sur l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation de fiduciaire d\u00e9coulant du contr\u00f4le discr\u00e9tionnaire exerc\u00e9 par la Couronne sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones dans la culture, pour certifier une action collective fond\u00e9e sur le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me de service d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves en Ontario,:\n[traduction]\nOn peut \u00e0 tout le moins soutenir qu\u2019une obligation de fiduciaire d\u00e9coule des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour les raisons suivantes : (i) la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a exerc\u00e9 ou assum\u00e9 un contr\u00f4le discr\u00e9tionnaire sur un int\u00e9r\u00eat autochtone pr\u00e9cis (en l\u2019occurrence la culture et l\u2019identit\u00e9) en concluant l\u2019entente de 1965; (ii) sans prendre de mesure pour prot\u00e9ger la culture et l\u2019identit\u00e9 des enfants vivant dans une r\u00e9serve; (iii) qui, selon la common law f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9taient \u00ab des pupilles de l\u2019\u00c9tat dont le soin et le bien-\u00eatre constituent une fiducie politique comportant les plus hautes obligations \u00bb; et (iv) qui risquent d\u2019\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime provincial de protection de l\u2019enfance en vertu duquel ils pourraient \u00eatre plac\u00e9s dans des foyers non autochtones.\n[109] Le Tribunal convient avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de pr\u00e9ciser davantage les droits des Autochtones en mati\u00e8re de langue et de culture ou l\u2019obligation de fiduciaire qui s\u2019y rattache. Il suffit de dire qu\u2019en raison de la protection pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, la culture et les langues autochtones doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats autochtones sp\u00e9cifiques \u00bb qui peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 une obligation de fiduciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque le gouvernement exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui ne tient pas compte de la culture et des langues autochtones ou qui entrave leur transmission, il peut manquer \u00e0 son obligation de fiduciaire. Toutefois, une telle conclusion n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9cider si AADNC fournit ou non un service ou, de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu des agissements discriminatoires au sens de la LCDP.\n[110] Il suffit de dire que l\u2019\u00e9laboration, par AADNC, du Programme des SEFPN et des ententes connexes, ainsi que les d\u00e9clarations publiques faites par AADNC \u00e0 ce sujet, d\u00e9montrent que la Couronne s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 agir dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour garantir qu\u2019on leur fournisse des services de protection de l\u2019enfance ad\u00e9quats et adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. Qu\u2019il en d\u00e9coule ou non une obligation de fiduciaire, le rapport fiduciaire entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones est un principe directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019analyse de toute mesure prise par le gouvernement concernant les peuples autochtones. Dans l\u2019analyse que nous faisons des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de la LCDP, ce principe illustre et renforce la nature publique des rapports qui existent entre AADNC et les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon en ce qui concerne la mise en \u0153uvre du Programme des SEFPN et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales.\niii. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conclusions\n[111] Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il ressort de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve que le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes sont offerts par AADNC \u00e0 titre d\u2019aide ou d\u2019avantage qu\u2019il fournit aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s et n\u00e9goci\u00e9s au nom des Premi\u00e8res Nations par AADNC, un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui a la mission et le mandat de le faire. Les Premi\u00e8res Nations forment un public distinct \u00e0 qui AADNC offre ses services dans le cadre d\u2019une relation de fiduciaire et constitutionnelle unique. AADNC s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 assurer que membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves re\u00e7oivent des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture, qui se comparent raisonnablement aux services offerts aux autres r\u00e9sidents de la province dans des circonstances analogues. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il existe de toute \u00e9vidence une relation de caract\u00e8re public entre AADNC et les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture des services pr\u00e9vus par le Programme des SEFPN et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes.\n[112] Cette conclusion rejoint celle de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le jugement Premi\u00e8re Nation d\u2019Attawapiskat c. Canada, 2012 CF 948. Voici ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u00e9clare, au paragraphe 59, s\u2019agissant de la nature d\u2019ententes de financement semblables \u00e0 celles en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte :\n]\u2026] la [Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Attawapiskat] compte sur le soutien financier du gouvernement, par l\u2019entremise de [l\u2019Entente globale de financement], pour fournir des services essentiels \u00e0 ses membres, et [l\u2019Entente globale de financement] est donc essentiellement un contrat d\u2019adh\u00e9sion impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la [Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Attawapiskat] comme condition de ce soutien financier, malgr\u00e9 le fait que la [Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Attawapiskat] consente \u00e0 [l\u2019Entente globale de financement]. Il n\u2019y a aucune v\u00e9ritable n\u00e9gociation. Le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des pouvoirs entre le gouvernement et cette bande, qui d\u00e9pend de [l\u2019Entente globale de financement] pour sa survie, confirme le caract\u00e8re public de [l\u2019Entente globale de financement], et confirme qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un contrat d\u2019adh\u00e9sion.\n[113] Par cons\u00e9quent, et pour les motifs qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9s, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019AADNC offre effectivement un service par le truchement du Programme des SEFPN et d\u2019autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes. Dans les pages qui suivent, le Tribunal examinera les r\u00e9percussions du service offert par AADNC et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le que le mode de financement du Programme des SEFPN et des ententes provinciales\/territoriales d\u2019AADNC exerce sur la prestation des services qui leur sont fournis au d\u00e9triment des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon.\n[114] Avant d\u2019aborder le mode de financement du Programme des SEFPN et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, il est utile de bien comprendre comment les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance sont fournis au Canada. La docteure Cindy Blackstock, directrice ex\u00e9cutive de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, a donn\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage utile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (Transcription vol. 1, p. 110, 112, 124\u2011129, 132\u2011136, 138\u2011142 et 151; voir \u00e9galement Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 1).\n[115] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, au Canada, les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance englobent toute une gamme de services visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les enfants contre les mauvais traitements et la n\u00e9gligence, et \u00e0 soutenir les familles pour en favoriser l\u2019unit\u00e9. Le principal objectif vis\u00e9 par les travailleurs sociaux est de tout faire en leur pouvoir pour garder l\u2019enfant en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez lui et dans sa collectivit\u00e9. Les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance comportent deux principaux volets : la pr\u00e9vention et la protection.\n[116] Les services de pr\u00e9vention se divisent en trois grandes cat\u00e9gories, \u00e0 savoir les services d\u2019intervention primaire, secondaire et tertiaire. Les services d\u2019intervention primaire visent la collectivit\u00e9 dans son ensemble. Ils ont notamment pour objet de promouvoir la sensibilisation et l\u2019\u00e9ducation continues du public sur ce qui constitue une famille saine, ainsi que de proposer des m\u00e9thodes de pr\u00e9vention de la maltraitance envers les enfants et d\u2019y r\u00e9agir. Les services de pr\u00e9vention secondaire interviennent lorsqu\u2019un enfant commence \u00e0 susciter des inqui\u00e9tudes et qu\u2019une intervention rapide permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter une crise. Les services de pr\u00e9vention tertiaire ciblent des familles sp\u00e9cifiques lorsqu\u2019une crise a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cel\u00e9e ou qu\u2019un enfant est expos\u00e9 \u00e0 des risques. Les services d\u2019intervention tertiaire se veulent une \u00ab mesure moins perturbatrice \u00bb qu\u2019une s\u00e9paration de l\u2019enfant de sa famille, en ce sens qu\u2019ils cherchent \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer les risques que comporte le retrait de l\u2019enfant de son milieu familial. Une intervention pr\u00e9coce visant \u00e0 offrir du soutien \u00e0 la famille peut contribuer grandement \u00e0 garder les enfants en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans leur milieu familial.D\u2019ailleurs, les lois provinciales exigent que l\u2019on \u00e9puise les mesures les moins perturbatrices avant de recourir \u00e0 un placement.\n[117] Les services de protection entrent en sc\u00e8ne lorsque l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou le bien-\u00eatre d\u2019un enfant est compromis. Si un enfant ne peut vivre en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la maison familiale pendant que des mesures sont prises avec sa famille pour corriger la situation, les travailleurs sociaux voient \u00e0 ce que l\u2019enfant soit plac\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on temporaire ou permanente dans une autre maison o\u00f9 l\u2019on pourra s\u2019occuper de lui. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle un \u00ab placement \u00bb. Le premier choix pour prendre en charge l\u2019enfant en pareil cas sera un des membres de la famille \u00e9largie ou une famille d\u2019accueil. La prise en charge de l\u2019enfant par sa famille \u00e9largie, par des personnes qui ont un lien significatif avec lui ou par une famille d\u2019origine ethnoculturelle ou de confession similaire est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un placement dans la famille \u00e9largie.\n[118] Le r\u00e9seau des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est normalement appel\u00e9 \u00e0 intervenir lorsqu\u2019une personne s\u2019inqui\u00e8te au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou du bien-\u00eatre d\u2019un enfant et fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 un travailleur social. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consiste pour le travailleur social \u00e0 faire une \u00e9valuation sommaire du signalement, pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de mener une enqu\u00eate plus approfondie. Si le travailleur social estime qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate est justifi\u00e9e, il peut rencontrer les membres de la famille et interroger l\u2019enfant. L\u2019enfant n\u2019est pas retir\u00e9 de sa famille au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, \u00e0 moins que sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne soit compromise. Le travailleur social \u00e9labore un plan d\u2019action pour l\u2019enfant et sa famille, en collaboration avec la famille \u00e9largie et des professionnels (par ex., enseignants, \u00e9ducateurs de la petite enfance et travailleurs en milieu culturel). Une gamme compl\u00e8te de services peut \u00eatre offerte, notamment des services de counseling personnel et de mentorat par un a\u00een\u00e9, des programmes de d\u00e9veloppement de la petite enfance ou des programmes visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les aptitudes parentales et m\u00e9nag\u00e8res de la personne charg\u00e9e de s\u2019occuper de l\u2019enfant.\n[119] Il existe toutefois des circonstances dans lesquelles le risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou le bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfant est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour \u00eatre att\u00e9nu\u00e9 tout en le gardant chez lui. L\u2019enfant ne peut pas rester dans son milieu familial. Dans ce cas, la plupart des lois provinciales exigent que le travailleur social se tourne d\u2019abord vers la famille \u00e9largie pour v\u00e9rifier si une tante, un oncle ou des grands-parents peuvent s\u2019occuper de l\u2019enfant. L\u2019enfant ne devrait \u00eatre retir\u00e9 \u00e0 sa famille et plac\u00e9 en foyer d\u2019accueil, en vertu d\u2019une ordonnance de garde temporaire, que s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre solution. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019octroi d\u2019une l\u2019ordonnance de garde temporaire, le travailleur social doit compara\u00eetre devant le tribunal pour expliquer le placement et le plan d\u2019interventionconcernant l\u2019enfant et le soutien de la famille. L\u2019ordonnance de garde temporaire peut \u00eatre reconduite et \u00e9ventuellement, en cas d\u2019\u00e9chec de tous les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s, le placement de l\u2019enfant peut devenir permanent.\n[120] Les principaux types de mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s aux enfants sont les agressions sexuelles, physiques ou psychologiques, ou le fait d\u2019y \u00eatre expos\u00e9, et la n\u00e9gligence. Dans le cas des Premi\u00e8res Nations, la principale source de mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s aux enfants est la n\u00e9gligence, qui se pr\u00e9sente sous la forme d\u2019un manque d\u2019encadrement et de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins fondamentaux. Dans les r\u00e9serves, la pauvret\u00e9, les mauvaises conditions de logement, l\u2019alcoolisme et la toxicomanie sont des facteurs de risque courants qui requi\u00e8rent la prestation de services pr\u00e9coces de counseling et de soutien aux enfants et aux familles pour \u00e9viter l\u2019intervention des services de protection de l\u2019enfance.\n[121] AADNC finance les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon de diverses mani\u00e8res. Au moment de la plainte, il y avait 105 organismes de SEFPN dans les 10 provinces du Canada (104 au moment de l\u2019audience). Le Programme des SEFPN s\u2019applique \u00e0 la plupart des organismes de SEFPN au Canada et utilise deux mod\u00e8les de financement : la Directive minist\u00e9rielle 20\u20111 et l\u2019Approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention (l\u2019AAAP). En Ontario, le financement est accord\u00e9 par l\u2019entremise de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Dans certaines r\u00e9gions de l\u2019Alberta et de la Colombie-Britannique, le financement est accord\u00e9 aux termes de l\u2019Alberta Reform Agreement et du Protocole d\u2019entente de la CB et, depuis 2012, du BC Service Agreement. Enfin, au Yukon, le financement est accord\u00e9 en vertu du Yukon Funding Agreement (t\u00e9moignage de Mme Barbara D\u2019Amico, analyste principale en mati\u00e8re de politiques \u00e0 la Direction de la politique et des programmes sociaux d\u2019AADNC, Transcription, vol. 50, p. 141). Chaque mode de financement sera abord\u00e9 \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[122] En ce qui concerne tout d\u2019abord du Programme des SEFPN, selon les autorisations accord\u00e9es \u00e0 AADNC, la province ou le territoire et l\u2019organisme doivent parvenir \u00e0 une entente avant la conclusion de modalit\u00e9s de financement avec un organisme de SEFPN (aussi appel\u00e9 \u00ab b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb).Cette entente doit satisfaire aux exigences de la politique nationale sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations d\u2019AADNC (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 4.1). Par la suite, le financement est fourni au moyen d\u2019une entente globale de financement (EGF) qui consiste en une \u00ab [...] entente qui unit [AADNC] et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire [...] et qui vise le financement des programmes inscrits au budget [...] \u00bb (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 4.4.1).

Dans ce dernier cas, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut garder les fonds non d\u00e9pens\u00e9s, \u00e0 la condition que les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente globale de financement soient respect\u00e9es, mais il doit aussi absorber tout d\u00e9ficit. Dans le cadre du Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les fonds non d\u00e9pens\u00e9s soient utilis\u00e9s pour atteindre les objectifs du programme.\n[123] Le financement des organismes de SEFPN est \u00e9tabli conform\u00e9ment aux \u00ab autorisations \u00bb accord\u00e9es \u00e0 AADNC (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 1.4). Ces \u00ab autorisations \u00bb sont accord\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, par l\u2019entremise du Cabinet et du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor et \u00ab sont pris[es] en compte dans la Directive de programme \u00bb (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 1.4.5). La Directive de programme, \u00e9galement appel\u00e9e Directive 20\u20111, que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe A du Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), \u00ab [\u2026] interpr\u00e8te [\u2026] les autorisations et les place dans un contexte o\u00f9 elles peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es \u00bb (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 1.4.5).

Par ailleurs :\n[\u2026] en plus de fournir des d\u00e9tails sur la fa\u00e7on dont AINC administrera le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale, le manuel se veut un document didactique destin\u00e9 aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019administration centrale et des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux d\u2019AINC. Ensemble, le manuel national et les manuels r\u00e9gionaux devraient d\u00e9crire avec pr\u00e9cision le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par le Minist\u00e8re dans les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations au Canada.\n(Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), Introduction, p. 2)\n[124] Avant 2007, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, toutes les provinces et le Yukon, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019Ontario, \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111.\u00c0l\u2019heure actuelle, le Nouveau-Brunswick, la Colombie-Britannique, Terre\u2011Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador et le Yukon sont assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111.\n[125] Conform\u00e9ment au Programme des SEFPN, AADNC s\u2019est notamment engag\u00e9, au nombre des principes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Directive 20\u20111 \u00ab [...] \u00e0 rehausser les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts dans les r\u00e9serves de sorte qu\u2019ils s\u2019apparentent \u00e0 ceux fournis en dehors des r\u00e9serves dans des conditions semblables [...] conform\u00e9ment aux lois provinciales et territoriales sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille applicables \u00bb (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), annexe A, art. 6.1 et 6.6). De plus, la Directive 20\u20111 appuie \u00ab [...] la cr\u00e9ation de services con\u00e7us, dirig\u00e9s et administr\u00e9s par les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), annexe A, art. 6.2). Aux termes de la Directive 20\u20111, le financement des organismes de SEFPN rel\u00e8ve de deux cat\u00e9gories distinctes : les co\u00fbts d\u2019exploitation et les frais d\u2019entretien.\n[126] Le financement allou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation est cens\u00e9 couvrir les frais d\u2019exploitation et d\u2019administration.Ces frais incluent notamment les salaires, les d\u00e9placements et les avantages sociaux du personnel de l\u2019organisme, les d\u00e9penses associ\u00e9es au perfectionnement professionnel, le co\u00fbt des services juridiques, les services de soutien \u00e0 la famille et l\u2019administration de l\u2019organisme, y compris le loyer et les d\u00e9penses de bureau (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 2.2.2 et annexe A, art. 19.1). Le budget d\u2019exploitation est calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une formule reposant sur le nombre d\u2019enfants de moins de 18 ans vivant dans la r\u00e9serve, selon les donn\u00e9es que l\u2019on trouve chaque ann\u00e9e dans les rapports annuels produits par les Premi\u00e8res Nations dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada. AADNC calcule le financement vers\u00e9 pour les frais d\u2019exploitation chaque ann\u00e9e, en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre, en s\u2019appuyant sur les donn\u00e9es d\u00e9mographiques de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (Manuel relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 3.2). Les organismes de SEFPN peuvent recevoir un montant fixe pour les d\u00e9penses administratives, calcul\u00e9 selon la formule suivante :\nUn montant fixe de 143 158,84 $ par organisme + 10 713,59 $ par bande participante + 726,91 $ par enfant (\u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 18 ans) + 9 235,23 $ x le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement moyen + 8 865,90 $ par bande participante x le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement moyen + 73,65 $ par enfant x le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement moyen + les co\u00fbts r\u00e9els des soins re\u00e7us dans les familles d\u2019accueil, les centres d\u2019h\u00e9bergement et les institutions, au tarif quotidien fix\u00e9 par la province ou le territoire.\n(Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), Annexe A, art. 19.1a); voir \u00e9galement Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 3.2.1 \u00e0 3.2.3)\n[127] Le facteur d\u2019ajustement est multipli\u00e9 par 9 235,23 $.Le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement est multipli\u00e9 par 8 865,90 $, puis par le nombre de bandes dans la zone desservie par l\u2019organisme.Le nombre d\u2019enfants (\u00e2g\u00e9s de moins de 18 ans) est multipli\u00e9 par 73,65 $, puis par le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 3.2.3). Le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement tient compte d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que la distance entre la Premi\u00e8re Nation et un centre de service, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une route et les services disponibles. Il varie de 0 \u00e0 1,9. Si plusieurs collectivit\u00e9s sont desservies par un organisme de SEFPN, le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement de chacune des collectivit\u00e9s est pond\u00e9r\u00e9 pour obtenir un \u00ab facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement moyen \u00bb (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 28 et 29).\n[128] Les chiffres retenus pourle mod\u00e8le de financement du budget d\u2019exploitation sont fond\u00e9s sur certaines hypoth\u00e8ses datant de l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es quatre-vingt-dix :\nEn moyenne, 6 % des enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves font l\u2019objet d\u2019un placement;\nEn moyenne, 20 % des familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves ont besoin des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ou sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des familles aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes multiples;\nIl y a un travailleur des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et un intervenant en soutien familial par 20 enfants plac\u00e9s;\nOn compte un superviseur et un employ\u00e9 de soutien pour cinq travailleurs;\nLes salaires sont calcul\u00e9s en fonction du salaire moyen en Ontario et au Manitoba.\n(Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 13, p. 7 et 8 [Rapport Wen: De no 1]).\n[129] Selon Mme D\u2019Amico, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle 6 % des enfants vivant dans une r\u00e9serve font l\u2019objet d\u2019un placement est fond\u00e9e sur la moyenne nationale de 2007 et elle assure une certaine stabilit\u00e9 aux organismes de SEFPN. Autrement dit, m\u00eame si un organisme a \u2013 ou atteint plus tard \u2013 un pourcentage moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s, son budget n\u2019est pas affect\u00e9. Le cinqui\u00e8me des familles ayant besoin de services est calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8sevoulant que chaque famille compte en moyenne trois enfants. En divisant le nombre total d\u2019enfants vivant dans la r\u00e9serve par trois, AADNC obtient le nombre de familles qui, selon lui, seraient normalement desservies par l\u2019organisme de SEFPN concern\u00e9. Il retient ensuite le cinqui\u00e8me de ce calcul comme variable pour d\u00e9terminer le budget de l\u2019organisme de SEFPN (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 25 \u00e0 31).\n[130] Le mod\u00e8le de financement est graduellement mis en \u0153uvre au cours des quatre premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d\u2019activit\u00e9 du nouvel organisme de SEFPN.Ainsi, le nouvel organisme re\u00e7oit 75 % des fonds durant sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019activit\u00e9; ce pourcentage passe \u00e0 85 % durant sa deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, puis \u00e0 95 %, la troisi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e et \u00e0 100 % la quatri\u00e8me ann\u00e9e [Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 3.2.1, annexe A, art. 19.1c)]. De plus, dans le cas des organismes desservant moins de 1 000 enfants, le taux fixe maximal de 143 158,84 $ est r\u00e9duit de la mani\u00e8re suivante : 71 579,43 $ (si l\u2019organisme dessert entre 501 et 800 enfants); 35 789,10 $ (s\u2019il dessert entre 251 et 500 enfants).Les r\u00e9gions comptant une client\u00e8le de moins de 251 enfants, ne recevront aucun montant fixe [Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), annexe A, art. 19.2b)]. Toutefois, en Colombie-Britannique, l\u2019organisme doit compter une client\u00e8le d\u2019au moins 801 enfants pour pouvoir recevoir une pleine allocation (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 23).\n[131] Le financement de l\u2019entretien est cens\u00e9 couvrir le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el des d\u00e9penses admissibles engag\u00e9es pour un enfant des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vit ordinairement dans une r\u00e9serve, mais qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 hors du domicile familial. L\u2019enfant doit \u00eatre pris en charge conform\u00e9ment aux lois, normes et taux provinciaux ou territoriaux applicables aux familles d\u2019accueil, centres d\u2019h\u00e9bergement et institutions charg\u00e9s de lui prodiguer des soins. Les organismes de SEFPN doivent pr\u00e9senter des factures mensuelles de placement des enfants hors du foyer familial et ils sont rembours\u00e9s en fonction des d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), art. 3.3.1 et 3.3.2, annexe A, art. 20.1).\n[132] Jusqu\u2019en 2011, les organismes de SEFPN de la Colombie-Britannique \u00e9taient financ\u00e9s selon un mode de calcul bas\u00e9 sur le paiement d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s quotidiennes, mais ils ont depuis adopt\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode de remboursement de leurs d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien fond\u00e9e sur les frais effectivement engag\u00e9s. Toutefois, si le financement bas\u00e9 sur les d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es se traduit par un financement moins \u00e9lev\u00e9, les montants plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus selon la m\u00e9thode ant\u00e9rieure d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s quotidiennes sont conserv\u00e9s, dans le cadre du plan pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019adoption \u00e9ventuelle de l\u2019AAAP par les organismes de SEFPN de cette province (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 35 et 36 et t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 150 et 151).\n[133] Les organismes de SEFPN ont \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019opter pour le \u00ab financement souple \u00bb des frais d\u2019entretien selon la Directive 20\u20111 (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), annexe A, art. 20.2). Cette option permet aux organismes de recevoir en totalit\u00e9 leur allocation de financement d\u2019exploitation, en plus d\u2019une estimation de leurs frais d\u2019entretien fond\u00e9e sur des donn\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures. Cette option de financement souple a pour but d\u2019offrir aux organismes de SEFPN la marge de man\u0153uvre n\u00e9cessaire pour leur permettre de restructurer une partie de leur budget d\u2019entretien afin de l\u2019investir dans les services de pr\u00e9vention. L\u2019organisme de SEFPN doit avoir fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le bureau r\u00e9gional et l\u2019Administration centrale d\u2019AADNC pour se pr\u00e9valoir de cette option de financement souple. En 2006, seulement sept des 105 organismes de SEFPN se sont pr\u00e9valus de l\u2019option de financement souple (annexe, pi\u00e8ce 14, p. 5 [\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007)]).\n[134] Les montants pr\u00e9vus dans la Directive 20\u20111 sont \u00e9tablis en fonction de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1995-1996 et n\u2019ont pas beaucoup chang\u00e9 depuis, bien qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019ils doivent \u00eatre augment\u00e9s de 2 % par an, sous r\u00e9serve de la disponibilit\u00e9 des ressources (Manuel national relatif au Programme des SEFPN (2005), annexe A, art. 22.00; t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 64, p. 3 et 4). Par ailleurs, le financement maximal accord\u00e9 par AADNC correspond \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des co\u00fbts admissibles. Les organismes de SEFPN peuvent \u00eatre tenus de rembourser AADNC si la contribution d\u2019AADNC est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 000 $ et que le financement provenant de toutes les sources, y compris du secteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, d\u00e9passe les d\u00e9penses admissibles (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 10, art. 11.0 [les dispositions relatives au cumul]).\n[135] Depuis 2005, une augmentation de 8,24 % a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019allocation totale de chaque organisme de SEFPN conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111 (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 32; t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 17). Des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires sont \u00e9galement fournis au Nouveau-Brunswickpour le programme d\u2019aide pr\u00e9scolaire Head Start et pour les soins \u00e0 domicile, en vue de la transition vers l\u2019AAAP (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 169 \u00e0 173).\n[136] Autrement dit, depuis 2007, dans certaines provinces o\u00f9 s\u2019applique le Programme des SEFPN, AADNC a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au passage graduel du mod\u00e8le de financement de la Directive 20\u20111 \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP. Une entente est intervenue en vue de mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019AAAP en Alberta et en Saskatchewan en 2007, en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse en 2008, au Qu\u00e9bec en 2009, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00cele\u2011du\u2011Prince\u2011\u00c9douard en 2009 et au Manitoba en 2010.\n[137] Outre le volet de l\u2019exploitation et de l\u2019entretien, l\u2019AAAP comporte un volet consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention. Les services de pr\u00e9vention sont \u00ab offerts pour r\u00e9duire les r\u00e9percussions de la dysfonction et de l\u2019\u00e9clatement des familles ou des situations de crise et pour limiter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de placer l\u2019enfant en \u00e9tablissement, ou la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle il demeure dans un \u00e9tablissement \u00bb (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 33, art. 2.1.17; voir aussi p. 38, art. 4.4.1). Les d\u00e9penses admissibles au titre de la pr\u00e9vention incluent les salaires et les avantages sociaux des travailleurs en pr\u00e9vention et autres personnes-ressources, les frais de d\u00e9placement, les services para professionnels et les services de soutien familial, les services d\u2019encadrement pour les enfants, les conseils en \u00e9conomie familiale et le counseling non m\u00e9dical qui n\u2019est pas couvert par d\u2019autres sources de financement (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 38, art. 4.4.2).\n[138] La mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP d\u00e9bute par des discussions tripartites entre la province, la Premi\u00e8re Nation et AADNC. \u00c0 la suite de ces discussions tripartites, les parties \u00e9laborent un cadre de responsabilisation tripartite d\u00e9finissant les orientations, les objectifs, les indicateurs de r\u00e9sultat et les r\u00f4les et les responsabilit\u00e9s de chacune. \u00c0 l\u2019aide du cadre de responsabilisation, l\u2019organisme de SEFPN \u00e9labore un plan d\u2019affaires quinquennal initial, qu\u2019il soumet \u00e0 l\u2019examen d\u2019AADNC et \u00e0 l\u2019acceptation de la province. Le plan d\u2019affaires quinquennal est une condition pr\u00e9alable au financement de l\u2019AAAP (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 37, art. 4.3; voir \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 50, p. 146 \u00e0 152).\n[139] Une fois le cadre et le plan d\u2019affaires en place, les pourparlers sur les co\u00fbts peuvent d\u00e9buter. Selon le Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, le financement de l\u2019exploitation et des services de pr\u00e9vention repose sur un mod\u00e8le de co\u00fbts \u00e9labor\u00e9 aux tables tripartites r\u00e9gionales.Il est raisonnablement comparable au financement qui est accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la province de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en vertu de l\u2019autorisation de programme d\u2019AADNC (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 38, art. 4.4.1). Autrement dit, l\u2019AAAP est adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque province ou territoire, en fonction d\u2019une formule constitu\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments retenus aux tables tripartites. Le calcul des effectifs et des postes \u00e0 inclure dans la formule, ainsi quedes valeurs p\u00e9cuniaires \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 chaque poste, d\u00e9pend des variables fournies par la province (par exemple, les ratios en personnel, le ratio entre le personnel et le nombre de dossiers trait\u00e9s et les \u00e9chelons de salaire). Ces chiffres sont ensuite int\u00e9gr\u00e9s aux mod\u00e8les de co\u00fbt d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention d\u2019AADNC. On utilise un mod\u00e8le de co\u00fbt parce que les provinces n\u2019utilisent pas toujours une formule de financement qu\u2019AADNC peut reproduire (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 50, p. 56, 150 et 151; vol. 51, p. 18 \u00e0 66, 153 et 154).\n[140] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Directive 20\u20111, le mod\u00e8le de financement de l\u2019AAAP est \u00e9tabli en fonction du nombre d\u2019enfants desservis par l\u2019organisme de SEFPN.Il part de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle au moins 20 % des familles ont besoin de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et, 6 % des enfants sont pris en charge (toutefois au Manitoba, on part du principe que 7 % des enfants font l\u2019objet d\u2019une prise en charge pour \u00e9tablir le mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP). Le volet pr\u00e9vention du mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP est en grande partie fond\u00e9 sur les salaires n\u00e9cessaires pour le personnel charg\u00e9 d\u2019offrir les services : le nombre d\u2019effectifs n\u00e9cessaire est calcul\u00e9 en fonction du nombre estimatif d\u2019enfants pris en charge et de familles ayant besoin de services. Le nombre estimatif d\u2019enfants pris en charge est calcul\u00e9 en multipliant le nombre d\u2019enfants desservis par l\u2019organisme de SEFPN par le pourcentage pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 d\u2019enfants pris en charge. Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le nombre de familles ayant besoin de services est calcul\u00e9 en partant du nombre total d\u2019enfants desservis par l\u2019organisme de SEFPN. Ce chiffre est ensuite divis\u00e9 par le nombre moyen d\u2019enfants par famille de Premi\u00e8re Nation (trois enfants) puis multipli\u00e9 par le pourcentage pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de familles ayant besoin des services de pr\u00e9vention (20 %) (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 24 \u00e0 31).\n[141] On utilise ensuite les estimations ainsi \u00e9tablies d\u2019enfants pris en charge et de familles ayant besoin de services pour calculer les effectifs n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir les services de l\u2019organisme de SEFPN. Comme dans le cas de la Directive 20\u20111, on utilise les ratios provinciaux en ce qui a trait aux travailleurs sociaux par enfant pris en charge ou par famille ayant besoin de services, au nombre de superviseurs par groupe de travailleurs sociaux et au nombre de membres du personnel de soutien par travailleur pour estimer les effectifs n\u00e9cessaires pour des postes donn\u00e9s. Le salaire moyen correspondant aux postes en question dans la province, au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019AAAP est mise en \u0153uvre, constitue ensuite l\u2019essentiel du financement affect\u00e9 au volet pr\u00e9vention du mod\u00e8le de financement. (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 51, p. 32 \u00e0 79). Ainsi que Mme Murphy l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nNous nous pla\u00e7ons du point de vue du financement. Nous voulons qu\u2019il demeure comparable au financement accord\u00e9 par les provinces et non avec le type de service financ\u00e9 par la province, ou fourni, pardon.\n[\u2026]\nLa seule fa\u00e7on que nous avons trouv\u00e9e pour assurer cette comparabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019identifier et de calculer les variables, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les grilles salariales, les ratios, les ratios d\u2019effectifs, les ratios du nombre de dossiers trait\u00e9s. Ce sont les seuls outils de financement que nous avons pu trouver comme donn\u00e9es comparables et c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle nous les avons int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP.\n(Transcription, vol. 51, p. 178 et 179)\n[142] Les d\u00e9penses admissibles au titre de l\u2019AAAP pour l\u2019entretien et l\u2019exploitation sont d\u00e9finies aux articles 3.4 et 3.5 de la Directive 20\u20111 (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 38, art. 4.4.1). AADNC s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les organismes de SEFPN g\u00e8rent leurs co\u00fbts d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention en respectant leur budget (t\u00e9moignage de S. Murphy, Transcription, vol. 54, p. 170). Toutefois, l\u2019AAAP laisse une certaine souplesse aux organismes en leur permettant d\u2019affecter le financement accord\u00e9 au titre d\u2019un des trois volets (exploitation, entretien ou services de pr\u00e9vention) d\u2019un volet \u00e0 un autre \u00ab [\u2026] pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins et aux circonstances auxquels est confront\u00e9e chaque collectivit\u00e9 \u00bb (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 38, art. 4.4.1).\n[143] Aux termes de l\u2019AAAP, le financement des services de pr\u00e9vention et des frais d\u2019exploitation est \u00e9tabli au d\u00e9but d\u2019une p\u00e9riode quinquennale sur la base de co\u00fbts fixes (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 53, p. 16). Le financement de l\u2019AAAP est \u00e9tal\u00e9 sur une p\u00e9riode de trois \u00e0 quatre ans : l\u2019organisme de SEFPN re\u00e7oit 40 % du financement au cours de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, 60 %, lors de la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, et entre 80 et 100 % au cours de la troisi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e. Il re\u00e7oit le financement complet la quatri\u00e8me ann\u00e9e (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 52, p. 145 et 146). Une fois l\u2019AAAP pleinement mise en \u0153uvre, la formule de financement n\u2019est ajust\u00e9e annuellement que pour tenir compte du nombre d\u2019enfants au sein de la population desservie par l\u2019organisme de SEFPN. L\u2019AAAP ne pr\u00e9voit pas de fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux hausses des frais d\u2019exploitation ou de pr\u00e9vention attribuables notamment aux augmentations es honoraires professionnels ou des salaires (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 52, p. 147 \u00e0 150; voir \u00e9galement Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 37, art. 4.1).\n[144] Par exemple, en Alberta, o\u00f9 l\u2019AAAP a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois mise en \u0153uvre en 2007, le salaire moyen du personnel charg\u00e9 de la prestation des services a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en fonction des chiffres de 2006.Ces chiffres sont toujours utilis\u00e9s huit ans plus tard pour calculer le budget de 2014 (t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 52, p. 153 et t\u00e9moignage de Mme Carol Schimanke, directrice du D\u00e9veloppement social, Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, Bureau r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Alberta d\u2019AADNC, Transcription, vol. 61, p. 115 et 116). Selon Mme D\u2019Amico, cette situation s\u2019explique par les raisons suivantes :\n[traduction]\nLa raison d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019AAAP \u00e9tait la suivante : si l\u2019on consacre de l\u2019argent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention et que l\u2019on fait beaucoup plus de travail d\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce, les frais d\u2019entretien diminuent. D\u00e8s lors que les frais d\u2019entretien diminuent, cet argent peut \u00eatre r\u00e9investi dans le budget d\u2019exploitation.\nL\u2019id\u00e9e \u2013 non pas la pratique, mais bien le principe de d\u00e9part \u2013 \u00e9tait que les organismes deviennent autonomes et puissent r\u00e9affecter l\u2019argent d\u2019un volet \u00e0 l\u2019autre. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle aucune clause d\u2019indexation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue.\nNous nous penchons maintenant sur le probl\u00e8me de ce qui arrive apr\u00e8s la cinqui\u00e8me ann\u00e9e si les frais d\u2019entretien ne peuvent plus servir \u00e0 combler les besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019exploitation, ou ne l\u2019ont jamais fait. Autrement dit, qu\u2019arrive\u2011t\u2011il si le principe ne fonctionne pas?\n(Transcription, vol. 52, p. 150 et 151)\n[145] Mme D\u2019Amico a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en pratique, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que certains organismes de SEFPN s\u2019occupent davantage d\u2019accueillir les enfants et de mener des enqu\u00eates dans le cadre de leur strat\u00e9gie de pr\u00e9vention, le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge a augment\u00e9, et les frais d\u2019entretien n\u2019ont pas diminu\u00e9 (Transcription, vol. 51, p. 91 et 92). La formule de financement de l\u2019\u2019AAAP ne pr\u00e9voit par ailleurs pas de fonds pour l\u2019accueil et les enqu\u00eates.\n[146] Selon l\u2019AAAP, le financement de l\u2019entretien est pr\u00e9vu au budget chaque ann\u00e9e en fonction des d\u00e9penses r\u00e9ellement engag\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019exercice pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (Manuel national programmes sociaux 2012, p. 38, art. 4.4.1). AADNC \u00ab r\u00e9am\u00e9nage \u00bb le budget d\u2019entretien des organismes chaque ann\u00e9e. Par exemple, si le budget d\u2019entretien d\u2019un organisme est de 100 $ la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, mais que ses d\u00e9penses pour cette ann\u00e9e ne s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent qu\u2019\u00e0 80 $, AADNC ram\u00e8nera \u00e0 80 $ son budget d\u2019entretien la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e. Si le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e augmente de fa\u00e7on inattendue, l\u2019organisme doit travailler \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des limites de son budget courant pour faire face aux frais impr\u00e9vus dans l\u2019intervalle.\n[147] En d\u2019autres termes, si les frais d\u2019entretien sont plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que le montant fixe du financement d\u2019entretien, l\u2019organisme de SEFPN doit combler son d\u00e9ficit \u00e0 m\u00eame le budget d\u2019exploitation ou de pr\u00e9vention. AADNC retient certains fonds de mani\u00e8re centralis\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de chaque exercice pour venir en aide aux organismes dont le budget d\u2019entretien demeure d\u00e9ficitaire malgr\u00e9 tout. Une fois ces fonds \u00e9puis\u00e9s, AADNCpuise dans les fonds d\u2019autres programmes du minist\u00e8re pour couvrir les frais d\u2019entretien. Si un organisme de SEFPN dispose d\u2019un surplus dans son budget d\u2019entretien, il peut le conserver et le r\u00e9affecter \u00e0 d\u2019autres d\u00e9penses admissibles (t\u00e9moignage de C. Schimanke, Transcription, vol. 61, p. 91 et 96 \u00e0 98; t\u00e9moignage de B. D\u2019Amico, Transcription, vol. 50, p. 174 \u00e0 181; t\u00e9moignage de S. Murphy, Transcription, vol. 54, p. 167 \u00e0 168 et 172 \u00e0 174).\n[148] AADNC re\u00e7oit une augmentation annuelle de 2 % de son budget au titre des programmes sociaux. Toutefois, dans le cas du Programme des SEFPN, cette augmentation de 2 % est calcul\u00e9e en fonction du budget du Programme des SEFPN avant la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP chiffr\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 450 millions de dollars. Mme Murphy a estim\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 627 millions de dollars le budget actuel du Programme des SEFPN en tenant compte de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP. Pour reprendre ses propres paroles :\n[traduction]\nAinsi, la diff\u00e9rence avec les 450 millions de dollars s\u2019explique en partie par cette augmentation de 2 % (la partie attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation), en partie par les nouveaux investissements dont a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP dans le cas des six provinces et territoires concern\u00e9s et, pour le reste, par la r\u00e9affectation de ses ressources.\n(Transcription, vol. 54, p. 177, 189 \u00e0 191; voir \u00e9galement, vol. 55, p. 188 et 189)\nb. Rapports sur le Programme des SEFPN\n[149] Le Programme des SEFPN a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 dans de nombreux rapports : en 2000, dans le rapport final du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen conjoint des politiques nationales sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019EPN); dans trois \u00e9tudes connexes r\u00e9alis\u00e9es en 2004 et 2005, en l\u2019occurrence les rapports Wen: De; dans deux rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale remontant \u00e0 2008 et \u00e0 2011.Il a \u00e9galement fait l\u2019objet de deux rapports de suivi publi\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics de la Chambre des communes.\nRapport final du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen conjoint des politiques nationales sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations\n[150] L\u2019EPN a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 en 2000. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un rapport publi\u00e9 par AANDC en collaboration avec l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Bien que l\u2019EPN soit ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la plainte d\u2019environ huit ans, son analyse des r\u00e9percussions de la Directive 20\u20111 est encore d\u2019actualit\u00e9, car la formule de financement s\u2019applique encore \u00e0 bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN et au Yukon. Le rapport utilise \u00e9galement une m\u00e9thodologie et un mode de consultation rigoureux arriver \u00e0 ses conclusions. Le Tribunal estime que cette \u00e9tude initiale de la Directive 20\u20111 est informative et constitue un point de d\u00e9part utile pour comprendre les r\u00e9percussions du mod\u00e8le de financement d\u2019AADNC sur les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves.\n[151] L\u2019EPN explique le contexte dans lequel les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille sont offerts aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ce contexte inclut les graves traumatismes subis par les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations et leur famille, traumatismes qui se sont traduits par des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019identit\u00e9 et des difficult\u00e9s de fonctionnement pour bon nombre d\u2019entre eux. Ces traumatismes sont notamment attribuables au r\u00e9gime historique des pensionnats indiens et \u00e0 ses r\u00e9percussions d\u2019une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Ils d\u00e9coulent aussi de la migration des membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui a perturb\u00e9 le concept traditionnel de la famille (EPN, p. 32 et 33). Comme l\u2019EPN explique, \u00e0 la page 33 :\n[traduction]\nLes familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 au centre d\u2019une lutte historique entre, d\u2019une part, les gouvernements coloniaux, qui voulaient \u00e9radiquer leur culture, leur langue et leur vision du monde et, d\u2019autre part, la famille traditionnelle, qui croyaient en un monde \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 pour ses enfants et les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00e0 venir. Cette lutte a entra\u00een\u00e9 des dysfonctionnements sociaux, un taux de suicide \u00e9lev\u00e9 et de la violence, ce qui a eu de vastes r\u00e9percussions interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnelles.\n[152] Selon l\u2019EPN, [traduction] \u00ab la Directive 20\u20111 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et la souplesse en mati\u00e8re de financement des organismes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (p. 10). Un des principes de la Directive 20\u20111 est l\u2019engagement d\u2019AADNC de fournir dans les r\u00e9serves des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille d\u2019un niveau comparable \u00e0 ceux qui sont fournis hors des r\u00e9serves dans des situations semblables (EPN, p. 20). C\u2019est la norme qu\u2019applique AADNC et il s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les organismes de SEFPN la respectent :\n[traduction]\nConform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs qui leur sont d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les provinces, aux attentes de leurs collectivit\u00e9s et du MAINC, les organismes de SEFPN sont cens\u00e9s offrir dans les r\u00e9serves une gamme de services comparables avec le financement qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111.\n(EPN, p. 83, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[153] Toutefois, l\u2019EPN conclut que le mod\u00e8le de financement pr\u00e9vu par la Directive 20\u20111 nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des organismes de SEFPN de r\u00e9pondre aux attentes en ce qui concerne la prestation d\u2019une gamme comparable de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves, et ce, pour diverses raisons :\nLe mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9voit le m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de financement des organismes, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019ampleur, de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 ou du co\u00fbt des services (p. 83).\nLa d\u00e9finition des frais d\u2019entretien varie d\u2019une r\u00e9gion \u00e0 l\u2019autre, de sorte qu\u2019AADNC refuse des frais d\u2019entretien qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre rembours\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux lois et aux normes provinciales\/territoriales (p. 13 et 14, 84).\nLe personnel n\u2019est pas suffisamment financ\u00e9 et le mod\u00e8le de financement n\u2019est pas assez souple pour permettre aux organismes de s\u2019ajuster aux changements de situation (par ex., une hausse du nombre de prises en charge, l\u2019\u00e9laboration de nouveaux programmes provinciaux\/territoriaux, les ajustements courants de prix pour tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9loignement (p. 13 et 14, 65, 70, 92 et 93, 96 et 97).\nOn n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la hausse du co\u00fbt de la vie depuis 1995\u20111996 (p. 18 et 26).\nLe financement des\u00e9valuations n\u2019est offert qu\u2019aux nouveaux organismes de SEFPN, pour des \u00e9valuations aux trois ans et aux six ans.Toutefois, la l\u00e9gislation provinciale exige des \u00e9valuations continues (p. 11).\nLes Premi\u00e8res Nations doivent composer avec les m\u00eames contraintes administratives d\u00e9coulant des modifications apport\u00e9es aux lois provinciales sans avoir obtenu plus de ressources pour faire face \u00e0 leurs obligations, ce qui contredit le principe de la Directive 20\u20111 (p. 12).\nLes organismes de plus petite taille souffrent d\u2019un manque de soutien administratif qui est aggrav\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9loignement g\u00e9ographique (p. 14 et 97).\nL\u2019augmentation maximale annuelle budg\u00e9taire de 2 % ne correspond pas \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation annuelle moyenne des co\u00fbts de 6,2 % pour les organismes de SEFPN (p. 14).\nLes d\u00e9penses moyennes par enfant pris en charge \u00e9taient de 22 % moins \u00e9lev\u00e9es que la moyenne provinciale (p. 14).\nLe mod\u00e8le ne pr\u00e9voit pas de ressources suffisantes pour permettre aux organismes de SEFPN de prendre les mesures de pr\u00e9vention cibl\u00e9es ou \u00e9tablies par la l\u00e9gislation, des programmes de rechange ou les mesures les moins perturbatrices ou les moins intrusives pour les enfants \u00e0 risque (p. 120).\n[154] L\u2019EPN a fait 17 recommandations pour r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es au sujet de la Directive 20\u20111, y compris celle d\u2019envisager une nouvelle m\u00e9thodologie pour financer les frais d\u2019exploitation. Le Rapport a recommand\u00e9 que la nouvelle m\u00e9thode de financement tienne compte de facteurs comme une analyse du nombre de dossiers trait\u00e9s, des donn\u00e9es d\u00e9mographiques nationales et leurs r\u00e9percussions sur les organismes de petite et de grande taille, ainsi que des \u00e9conomies d\u2019\u00e9chelle (EPN, p. 119 \u00e0 121). On a \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 la mise en place d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de gestion de l\u2019information pour s\u2019assurer que l\u2019on mette en place des m\u00e9thodes de cueillette, d\u2019analyse et de pr\u00e9sentation des donn\u00e9es uniformes et fiables au sein d\u2019AADNC, des organismes de SEFPN et des provinces et territoires (EPN, p. 121).\nLes rapports Wen: De\n[155] L\u2019EPN a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la mise sur pied du Comit\u00e9 consultatif charg\u00e9 de l\u2019examen conjoint des politiques nationales (le CCN) en 2001. Le CCN \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019AADNC, de l\u2019APN et d\u2019organismes de SEFPN. Le CCN \u00e9tait notamment charg\u00e9 de chercher comment modifier certaines parties de la Directive 20\u20111 pour donner suite aux recommandations de l\u2019EPN. Financ\u00e9 par AADNC, le CCN a command\u00e9 d\u2019autres recherches pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y avait lieu de r\u00e9viser le Programme des SEFPN et la Directive 20\u20111. Trois rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits sur la question : les rapports Wen: De. Chacun des trois rapports pr\u00e9cise clairement la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour arriver \u00e0 ses conclusions et explique avec force d\u00e9tails ses conclusions. Trois auteurs qui ont largement contribu\u00e9 aux rapports Wen: De, Dre Cindy Blackstock, Dr. John Loxley et Dr. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9, ont longuement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de ces rapports et ont confirm\u00e9 leurs conclusions.\n[156] Le premier rapport Wen: De, publi\u00e9 en 2004, visait tout d\u2019abord \u00e0 proposer trois nouvelles options de financement des organismes de SEFPN, ainsi que le programme de recherche n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tayer chacune de ces options (Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 4). Les auteurs ont expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient recens\u00e9 les publications canadiennes et \u00e9trang\u00e8res pertinentes et qu\u2019ils avaient interrog\u00e9 des observateurs et des participants bien inform\u00e9s, notamment des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de conception du mod\u00e8le de financement du budget d\u2019exploitation De plus, ils ont rencontr\u00e9 six organismes de SEFPN repr\u00e9sentant diverses tailles, divers contextes de service, diverses r\u00e9gions et divers groupes culturels (Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 6).\n[157] Les auteurs ont not\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9occupations et les d\u00e9fis soulev\u00e9s par les organismes de SEFPN qu\u2019ils avaient interrog\u00e9s concordaient avec les conclusions et les recommandations de l\u2019EPN. Ils soulignaient notamment le manque de financement pour les services de pr\u00e9vention, les services juridiques, les frais d\u2019immobilisation, les syst\u00e8mes de gestion de l\u2019information, les programmes ax\u00e9s sur la culture, les prestataires de soins, le salaire et la formation du personnel et les ajustements de co\u00fbt pour les organismes \u00e9loign\u00e9s et ceux de petite taille (Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 6 et 8).\n[158] Le rapport a conclu, en particulier, que les organismes de SEFPN [traduction] \u00ab [...] ne sont pas financ\u00e9s en fonction des besoins, mais plut\u00f4t de la population \u00bb de sorte qu\u2019on constate [traduction] \u00ab des \u00e9carts r\u00e9gionaux importants dans la mise en \u0153uvre de la Directive 20\u20111, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les fonctionnaires charg\u00e9s du financement au sein du minist\u00e8re l\u2019adaptent \u00e0 leur contexte local \u00bb (Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 5). Le rapport conclut par cons\u00e9quent :\n[traduction]\nDans l\u2019ensemble, nos conclusions confirment que les conclusions et les recommandations de l\u2019EPN publi\u00e9es en juin 2000 traduisent d\u00e9j\u00e0 les pr\u00e9occupations que les SEFPN \u00e9prouvent encore aujourd\u2019hui [\u2026] Tous les organismes conviennent qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de corriger imm\u00e9diatement le manque de financement pour favoriser les meilleures pratiques en travail social au sein de leurs collectivit\u00e9s.\n(Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 6)\n[159] Le Rapport Wen: De no 1 propose trois options pour donner suite \u00e0 cette conclusion : (1) repenserle mod\u00e8le de financement actuel; (2) suivre le mod\u00e8le de financement de la province ou du territoire dans lequel l\u2019organisme se trouve; (3) proposer une nouvelle formule de financement propre aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, qui finance les organismes en fonction des besoins et des atouts de la collectivit\u00e9 ainsi que des caract\u00e9ristiques culturelles et socio\u00e9conomiques particuli\u00e8res des collectivit\u00e9s et des Premi\u00e8res Nations que les organismes desservent (Rapport Wen: De no 1, p. 7 \u00e0 13).\n[160] Le Rapport Wen: De no 2 a analys\u00e9 les trois options pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le premier rapport (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 15 [Rapport Wen: De no 2]). Pour ce faire, les divers auteurs du rapport ont analys\u00e9 les publications sur le sujet et interrog\u00e9 des personnes cl\u00e9s provenant d\u2019un \u00e9chantillon de douze organismes de SEFPN. Une des principales m\u00e9thodes a \u00e9t\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des \u00e9tudes de cas d\u00e9taill\u00e9es des douze organismes et des provinces, en utilisant des questionnaires standardis\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9s par des chercheurs dans chaque r\u00e9gion. Cette m\u00e9thode de recherche incluait des projets de recherche sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s sur la fr\u00e9quence des signalements de cas de maltraitance d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations des et la r\u00e9ponse des travailleurs sociaux.Les recherches portaient \u00e9galement sur les services pr\u00e9ventifs, les questions de comp\u00e9tence, les situations extraordinaires, les services de gestion de l\u2019information et les organismes de petite taille (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 7, 9 \u00e0 11).\n[161] Les auteurs du Rapport Wen: De no 2 ont commenc\u00e9 par une \u00e9tude de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue par les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations lors de leur contact avec le syst\u00e8me canadien d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ils rel\u00e8vent que les principaux facteurs de risques favorisant la n\u00e9gligence chez les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont la pauvret\u00e9, le logement inad\u00e9quat et l\u2019abus de substances. Le rapport souligne que deux de ces trois facteurs, soit la pauvret\u00e9 et le logement inad\u00e9quat, sont des facteurs sur lesquels les parents ont peu de prise. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est peu probable que ces parents soient en mesure d\u2019\u00e9liminer ces facteurs de risque et cela peut entra\u00eener une p\u00e9riode de placement de leurs enfants plus longue, voire permanente dans certains cas (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 13). Relativement \u00e0 cette question, le Rapport Wen: De no 2 indique ce qui suit :\nIl y a approximativement trois fois plus d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui font l\u2019objet d\u2019un placement qu\u2019il y en avait au moment le plus fort des pensionnats indiens dans les ann\u00e9es quarante (p. 8).\nLes enfants autochtones sont deux fois plus susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate que les enfants non autochtones (p. 16).\nUne fois qu\u2019ils ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate, les dossiers d\u2019enfants autochtones sont davantage document\u00e9s et les enfants sont deux fois plus susceptibles d\u2019avoir besoin de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance de fa\u00e7on permanente (p. 16).\nLes enfants autochtones sont deux fois plus susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre plac\u00e9s hors du foyer et de se retrouver devant un tribunal de protection de la jeunesse (p. 16).\nLe profil des familles autochtones diff\u00e8re de fa\u00e7on marqu\u00e9e de celui des familles non autochtones (p. 16).\nLes cas de n\u00e9gligence pr\u00e9dominent dans les familles autochtones, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la pauvret\u00e9, le logement inad\u00e9quat et l\u2019abus de substances des parents repr\u00e9sentent une combinaison malsaine de facteurs de risque (p. 16).\n[162] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le rapport de Wen: De no 2 conclut ce qui suit en ce qui concerne le financement du Programme des SEFPN, aux pages 7 et 8 :\n[\u2026] le financement des agences de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations est insuffisant dans presque toutes les sph\u00e8res de leurs op\u00e9rations, allant des co\u00fbts en termes d\u2019immobilisations, des programmes de pr\u00e9vention, des normes et des \u00e9valuations, des salaires du personnel et des programmes pour les enfants faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une prise en charge. Ce besoin disproportionn\u00e9 pour des services destin\u00e9s aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, doubl\u00e9 du sous-financement des agences de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui les desservent, a pour r\u00e9sultat une situation intenable.\n[163] Compte tenu des r\u00e9sultats de leurs recherches, les auteurs du rapport ont estim\u00e9 que la Directive 20\u20111 devait \u00eatre profond\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences du Programme des SEFPN, ainsi que pour assurer des services d\u2019aide \u00e9quitables aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves. Plusieurs causes sous-tendent l\u2019insuffisance du financement. L\u2019une des principales lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111 est l\u2019absence d\u2019ajustement du financement pour tenir compte des hausses du co\u00fbt de la vie. Bien que la Directive 20\u20111 contienne un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019ajustement au co\u00fbt de la vie, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 depuis 1995. Selon le Rapport Wen: De no 2, le fait de ne pas ajuster le financement en fonction de l\u2019augmentation du co\u00fbt de la vie m\u00e8ne \u00ab au sous-financement des services et \u00e0 la distorsion dans les services financ\u00e9s, car certaines d\u00e9penses sujettes \u00e0 l\u2019inflation doivent \u00eatre couvertes alors que d\u2019autres sont optionnelles \u00bb (p. 51). Le Rapport Wen: De no 2 estime que les prix ont augment\u00e9 de 21,21 % au cours de la p\u00e9riode de dix ans \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis que la Directive 20\u20111 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajust\u00e9e pour la derni\u00e8re fois, en 1995, pour tenir compte de la hausse du co\u00fbt de la vie (p. 51). Le rapport a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait fallu 24,8 millions de plus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 seulement afin de combler la perte de pouvoir d\u2019achat accumul\u00e9e depuis 1995, (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 56).\n[164] La Directive 20\u20111 ne contient pas non plus de m\u00e9canisme permettant de tenir compte p\u00e9riodiquement de l\u2019inflation. Par exemple, depuis l\u2019instauration de la Directive 20\u20111 en 1990, aucun ajustement n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9 pour tenir compte des hausses de salaire. Les deux tiers des organismes de SEFPN qui ont particip\u00e9 au Rapport Wen: De no 2 ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le financement des salaires et des avantages sociaux n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant (p. 41 et 62). Le Rapport Wen: De no 2 estime \u00e0 112 millions de dollars la perte de financement du budget d\u2019exploitation attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019inflation (p. 63). Il ajoute que le financement n\u2019augmente que si le nombre d\u2019enfants lui-m\u00eame augmente. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans ces conditions, \u00ab soit que la qualit\u00e9 des services s\u2019est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e proportionnellement \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation du nombre d\u2019enfants ou les augmentations des co\u00fbts des services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 couvertes si et seulement si la proportion d\u2019enfants et de familles recevant des services a diminu\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 132).\n[165] Les auteurs du rapport rel\u00e8vent \u00e9galement que tous les organismes consid\u00e9raient que le seuil de population \u00e9tait un moyen inad\u00e9quat pour calculer le financement du budget d\u2019exploitation. Environ la moiti\u00e9 des r\u00e9pondants de l\u2019\u00e9tude ont mentionn\u00e9 que le financement devait \u00eatre bas\u00e9 sur les besoins de la communaut\u00e9 et non sur le nombre d\u2019enfants dans la population. Certains ont ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble de la population et non du seul nombre des enfants, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que c\u2019est toute la famille qui a besoin d\u2019aide lorsqu\u2019un enfant n\u2019est pas en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou est \u00e0 risque. En fait, les petits organismes (ceux qui desservent moins de 1 000 enfants) repr\u00e9sentent 55 % du nombre total d\u2019organismes de SEFPN. Selon 75 % des petits organismes qui ont particip\u00e9 au Rapport Wen: De no 2, les salaires et les avantages sociaux vers\u00e9s \u00e0 leur personnel ne se comparaient pas \u00e0 ceux des autres organismes de service \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (p. 54 et 55 et 227).\n[166] Par ailleurs, la Directive 20\u20111 ne pr\u00e9voit aucun m\u00e9canisme d\u2019ajustement pour tenir compte des lois et des normes provinciales et territoriales. Bien que le Programme des SEFPN repose sur un principe directeur voulant que les services soient comparables \u00e0 ceux fournis aux enfants vivant hors r\u00e9serve dans des circonstances similaires, il ne contient aucun m\u00e9canisme afin de s\u2019assurer que cet objectif puisse \u00eatre atteint (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 55).\n[167] En outre, les auteurs du Rapport Wen: De no 2 ont constat\u00e9 que les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations consult\u00e9s convenaient tous que la Directive 20\u20111 ne finan\u00e7ait pas suffisamment les frais de d\u00e9placement, les frais juridiques, les travailleurs de premi\u00e8re ligne et l\u2019\u00e9valuation de programmes.Elle ne finan\u00e7ait pas suffisamment non plus les services comptables, les services concierges, les r\u00e9unions d\u2019employ\u00e9s, les r\u00e9unions des comit\u00e9s de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail, les syst\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le personnel des ressources humaines des organismes de plus grande taille, les sp\u00e9cialistes d\u2019assurance de la qualit\u00e9 et les syst\u00e8mes de gestion de l\u2019information. De plus, les auteurs du Rapport Wen: De no 2 ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le financement ne tenait pas compte des changements technologiques importants survenus dans les \u00e9quipements et les logiciels au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie. Il ne tenant pas davantage compte de la hausse importante des co\u00fbts d\u2019assurance\u2011responsabilit\u00e9 civile depuis 10 ans. (p. 132 et 133). Le Rapport Wen: De no 2 mentionne \u00e9galement que dans la vaste majorit\u00e9 des cas, les syst\u00e8mes de gestion de l\u2019information ne respectaient pas les normes minimales (p. 63).\n[168] Il convient de souligner que le financement accord\u00e9 pour la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019insuffisant. De plus, 84 % des organismes de SEFPN vis\u00e9s par le rapport ont estim\u00e9 que les niveaux de financement actuels \u00e9taient insuffisants pour leur permettre d\u2019offrir des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture de leur client\u00e8le (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 63). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le rapport a conclu que \u00ab la formule de financement actuelle incite davantage \u00e0 placer les enfants qu\u2019\u00e0 adopter des mesures pr\u00e9ventives, \u00e0 faire de l\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce et \u00e0 permettre la mise en place de mesures les moins perturbatrices \u00bb (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 124). Cette situation est due au fait que le mod\u00e8le de financement pr\u00e9voit un remboursement des frais d\u2019\u00ab entretien \u00bb fond\u00e9 sur les d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es et que, dans bien des cas, les services de pr\u00e9vention ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des frais d\u2019entretien (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 19 \u00e0 21). Par cons\u00e9quent, le financement des services de pr\u00e9vention est qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019insuffisant, bien que la plupart des lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance exigent ces services (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 93). Pour cette raison, le rapport d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\nCeci signifie que les agences, dans cette situation, ne disposent pas du financement n\u00e9cessaire pour se conformer aux exigences statutaires de fournir aux familles une opportunit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de corriger la situation \u00e0 risque dont a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 le retrait de l\u2019enfant. Pis encore, les enfants se voient refuser une chance \u00e9quitable de demeurer dans leur milieu de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire en raison de la structure et des montants d\u2019argent d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par cette Directive. La Directive d\u00e9termine la pratique au lieu de la supporter.\n(Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 22)\n[169] Le Rapport Wen: De no 2 conclut que la troisi\u00e8me option, un nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement propre aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, finan\u00e7ant les organismes en fonction des besoins et des atouts, est le mod\u00e8le le plus prometteur et celui qui permettra de corriger les lacunes relev\u00e9es.En effet, il offre la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 de conceptualiser \u00e0 nouveau la p\u00e9dagogie, les politiques et les pratiques en termes de bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer et maintenir des r\u00e9sultats positifs chez les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 9). En somme, le Rapport Wen: De no 2 recommande un financement ciblant les mesures les moins perturbatrices et des fonds pour le d\u00e9veloppement de politiques et de normes culturellement adapt\u00e9es.Il recommande de s\u2019assurer que les fonds allou\u00e9s aux ressources humaines soient suffisants et d\u2019augmenter les investissements en recherche pour contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019orientation des politiques et de la pratique des organismes de SEFPN. Il recommande \u00e9galement d\u2019inclure une r\u00e9vision financi\u00e8re et les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires pour tenir compte des changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance (Rapport Wen: De no 2, p. 62).\n[170] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 portait sur l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts des modifications recommand\u00e9es dans le deuxi\u00e8me rapport (annexe, p. 16 [Rapport Wen: De no 3]). Un questionnaire de sondage national a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au point et envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 93 organismes de SEFPN. Trente-cinq d\u2019entre eux ont r\u00e9pondu, ce qui repr\u00e9sente 32 575 enfants, 146 Premi\u00e8res Nations et 28,6 millions de dollars en budget d\u2019exploitation.Ou encore, ils repr\u00e9sentaient 38 % de l\u2019ensemble des organismes de SEFPN, 49 % de l\u2019ensemble des bandes, 31,4 % des enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 0 \u00e0 18 ans et 28,7 % de l\u2019ensemble du financement du budget total d\u2019exploitation (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 9 et 10).\n[171] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 r\u00e9it\u00e8re les lacunes constat\u00e9es dans la Directive 20\u20111, aux pages 11 et 12 :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] 1) incertitude quant aux raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9laboration du mod\u00e8le au d\u00e9part; 2) interpr\u00e9tations r\u00e9gionales divergentes de directives parfois libell\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on vague; 3) omission de mettre en \u0153uvre certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la formule, tels que l\u2019ajustement annuel li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inflation; 4) incapacit\u00e9 de la politique de suivre l\u2019\u00e9volution des pratiques psychosociales fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es probantes, du droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance et des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information de gestion; et 5) la politique semble ignorer compl\u00e8tement certaines d\u00e9penses en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance ou les financer insuffisamment, p. ex. en n\u2019aidant pas les organismes \u00e0 intervenir aupr\u00e8s des enfants victimes de violence ou de n\u00e9gligence pour les garder en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez eux plut\u00f4t que de les placer en foyer d\u2019accueil.\n[172] Malgr\u00e9 ces lacunes, le Rapport Wen: De no 3 rel\u00e8ve certaines caract\u00e9ristiques positives de la Directive 20\u20111. Il souligne notamment son envergure nationale, qu\u2019elle a fait l\u2019objet de deux \u00e9tudes nationales, qu\u2019elle a permis la mise en place d\u2019organismes de SEFPN partout au Canada et qu\u2019elle constitue un bon point de d\u00e9part pour juger les impacts des \u00e9ventuels changements au r\u00e9gime actuel.\n[173] Ce sont l\u00e0 les raisons essentiellement \u00e0 la base de la recommandation de mettre en \u0153uvre \u00e0 la fois la premi\u00e8re et la troisi\u00e8me des options propos\u00e9es dans le Rapport Wen: De no 3.C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, repenser la Directive 20\u20111 d\u00e8s maintenant, en accordant la priorit\u00e9 au financement des services de pr\u00e9vention et en compensant les pertes de financement attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019inflation. Parall\u00e8lement,jeter les bases d\u2019un mod\u00e8le de financement propre aux Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 \u00e9laborer plus tard (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 11 et 12). De plus, en proposant que l\u2019on adopte la premi\u00e8re option, le rapport signalait que l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un mod\u00e8le de financement propre aux Premi\u00e8res Nations ne r\u00e9glerait pas instantan\u00e9ment les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par le mod\u00e8le de financement actuel (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 14).\n[174] La deuxi\u00e8me option, qui consiste \u00e0 appliquer les niveaux de financement provinciaux aux organismes de SEFPN, a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par les auteurs du rapport comme \u00e9tant la moins prometteuse.Les auteurs en sontarriv\u00e9s \u00e0 cette conclusion notamment parce qu\u2019on ne sait pas vraiment en quoi consiste le mod\u00e8le de plusieurs provinces. De plus, les Premi\u00e8res Nations ne disposent pas toutes des m\u00eames infrastructures et des m\u00eames programmes, services et organismes de b\u00e9n\u00e9voles. Par ailleurs, les traditions en mati\u00e8re financement provincial ne reposent pas sur les besoins particuliers des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et sur leur situation particuli\u00e8re, notamment le fait qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte plus cher pour desservir les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations parce que leurs besoins sont plus grands (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 13).\n[175] les auteurs du Rapport Wen: De no 3 recommandent que des r\u00e9formes soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111 et soulignent qu\u2019 [traduction] \u00ab il est vital que l\u2019on change les mentalit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de financement \u00bb (p. 20). Cela \u00e9tant dit, comme les auteurs l\u2019affirment \u00e0 la page 20 du Rapport Wen: De no 3 :\n[traduction]\nUne approche qui investit dans la collectivit\u00e9 et qui mobilise la collectivit\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les niveaux \u2013 les enfants, les adolescents, les jeunes, les parents et les a\u00een\u00e9s \u2013 signifie que l\u2019on oriente les ressources vers la croissance et le d\u00e9veloppement plut\u00f4t que vers les dysfonctionnements des membres de la collectivit\u00e9. Cette approche d\u00e9montre que l\u2019on s\u2019engage \u00e0 soutenir \u00e0 long terme la croissance des enfants et des familles et que l\u2019on investit dans l\u2019avenir de membres actifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[176] On trouve par ailleurs la mise en garde suivante, \u00e0 la page 15 du Rapport Wen: De no 3 :\n[traduction]\nBien que chaque facteur de changement propos\u00e9 soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment distinct, il importe de bien comprendre qu\u2019ils sont interd\u00e9pendants et que les adopter \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce nuirait \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des changements propos\u00e9s. Par exemple, pr\u00e9voir un financement des mesures les moins perturbatrices pour les interventions \u00e0 domicile dans les cas de maltraitance des enfants sans l\u2019assortir d\u2019un ajustement au co\u00fbt de la vie ferait en sorte que les organismes concern\u00e9s ne disposeraient pas des infrastructures et des effectifs n\u00e9cessaires pour optimiser les r\u00e9sultats. Ces recommandations partent \u00e9galement du principe que l\u2019enveloppe de financement des organismes de SEFPN ne subira aucune r\u00e9duction. Il faudrait \u00e9viter les situations dans lesquelles le financement dans un secteur est r\u00e9duit et est r\u00e9orient\u00e9 vers d\u2019autres volets des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, car nos chercheurs ont constat\u00e9 que le sous-financement \u00e9tait une constante pour tous les volets du mod\u00e8le actuel.\n[177] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 recommande certaines r\u00e9formes \u00e9conomiques \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111, ainsi que des changements de politique pour appuyer ces r\u00e9formes. Le Rapport recommande notamment les r\u00e9formes d\u2019ordre \u00e9conomique suivantes : instaurer un nouveau volet de financement pour les services de pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices (p. 19 \u00e0 21); ajuster le budget d\u2019exploitation (p. 24 et 25); r\u00e9instaurer le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019ajustement au co\u00fbt de la vie r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1995 (p. 18 et 19); offrir un financement suffisant pour couvrir les frais d\u2019immobilisation (immeubles, v\u00e9hicules et \u00e9quipement de bureau) (p. 28 et 29); financer l\u2019\u00e9laboration de normes culturelles par les organismes de SEFPN (p. 30).\n[178] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 recommande en particulier l\u2019allocation d\u2019un financement suppl\u00e9mentaire pour la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices (p. 19 et 21). \u00c0 la page 35, le Rapport Wen: De no 3 indique que le fait d\u2019accorder un financement additionnel pour la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices permettra, avec le temps, de r\u00e9aliser des \u00e9conomies :\n[traduction]\nBowlus et McKenna (2003) estiment que le co\u00fbt annuel, pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, des mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s aux enfants se chiffre \u00e0 16 milliards de dollars par ann\u00e9e. Comme un nombre toujours croissant d\u2019\u00e9tudes indique que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9s parmi les enfants, autochtones et non autochtones, faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un placement, ils repr\u00e9sentent une partie importante de ces co\u00fbts \u00e9conomiques (Trocm\u00e9, Knoke et Blackstock, 2004; Trocm\u00e9, Fallon, McLaurin et Shangreaux, 2005; McKenzie, 2002). Le d\u00e9faut de la part des gouvernements, d\u2019investir des sommes importantes pour financer la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices r\u00e9sulte en une fausse \u00e9conomie. Il faut choisir entre investir maintenant et \u00e9pargner plus tard ou \u00e9pargner maintenant et payer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 six ou sept fois davantage plus tard (Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9, 2004).\n[179] Le Rapport constate que le montant fixe par organisme, ou le montant pour les frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, ne procure pas un soutien administratif r\u00e9aliste aux organismes de petite taille, et ce, pour deux raisons. En premier lieu, aucun organisme repr\u00e9sentant des collectivit\u00e9s comptant 250 enfants ou moins ne re\u00e7oit quelque financement que ce soit pour ses frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. En second lieu, \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle le financement disponible est scind\u00e9 en trois blocs, selon la taille de la population desservie : dans le cas des collectivit\u00e9s de 251 \u00e0 500 personnes : 35 790 $; entre 501 et 800 personnes : 71 580 $; et pour celles comptant plus de 801 personnes : 143 158 $. La moindre augmentation ou diminution du nombre d\u2019enfants est susceptible de se traduire par une importante augmentation ou diminution du financement qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un organisme au titre de ses frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 23).\n[180] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Rapport Wen: De no 3 recommande deux r\u00e9formes. Il recommande tout d\u2019abord que le financement des frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux soit accord\u00e9 aux organismes desservant des collectivit\u00e9s comptant au moins 125 personnes. Le rapport propose un minimum de 20 000 $ pour les organismes de plus petite taille repr\u00e9sentant 125 enfants. La seconde suggestion est d\u2019accorder aux organismes un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire pour chaque tranche additionnelle de 25 enfants. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il y aurait encore six organismes qui seraient de trop petite taille pour recevoir un montant fixe. Huit petits organismes qui n\u2019ont encore jamais re\u00e7u de montants fixes pour le financement de leurs frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en recevraient d\u00e9sormais. Vingt-trois organismes de taille moyenne verraient leur financement augmenter et 56 organismes de grande taille ne verraient aucun changement dans leur financement. Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 estime qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avenir, des \u00e9conomies d\u2019\u00e9chelle minimales seront n\u00e9cessaires dans le cas des organismes de petite taille, pour garantir un niveau minimum de services aux enfants et \u00e0 la famille (p. 23 et 24).\n[181] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 a d\u00e9cel\u00e9 plusieurs lacunes concernant le facteur d\u2019\u00e9loignement pr\u00e9vu par la Directive 20\u20111. Il souligne notamment que 90 % des organismes sond\u00e9s ont estim\u00e9 que l\u2019ajustement moyen \u00e9tait trop faible pour compenser les pertes effectivement subies en raison de l\u2019\u00e9loignement.D\u2019autre part, l\u2019indice d\u2019\u00e9loignement est habituellement calcul\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 du centre de services le plus proche, mais ce centre n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement en mesure d\u2019offrir des services de protection de l\u2019enfance sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s. Selon le Rapport Wen: De no 3, ces faiblesses ont fait en sorte que certaines communaut\u00e9s ont re\u00e7u moins de services que ce \u00e0 quoi leur population avait droit alors que d\u2019autres en ont re\u00e7u plus. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Rapport propose une augmentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des allocations d\u2019\u00e9loignement et le remplacement de l\u2019indice fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un centre de services par un indice fond\u00e9 sur la proximit\u00e9 d\u2019un centre urbain (p. 25 et 26).\n[182] Le Rapport Wen: De no 3 recommande \u00e9galement qu\u2019AADNC pr\u00e9cise que les co\u00fbts juridiques se rapportant aux enfants pris en charge sont facturables sous la rubrique \u00ab frais d\u2019entretien \u00bb.Il recommande que les services de soutien se rapportant \u00e0 la r\u00e9unification des enfants pris en charge avec leur famille soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des d\u00e9penses d\u2019\u00ab entretien \u00bb admissibles \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de services prescrits par les lois provinciales sur la protection de l\u2019enfance.Il recommande que soit confirm\u00e9e la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des recherches et d\u2019adopter des m\u00e9canismes en vue de partager les meilleures m\u00e9thodes au niveau r\u00e9gional et national.Il recommande \u00e9galement qu\u2019AADNC clarifie les \u00ab dispositions relatives au cumul \u00bb que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111 pour faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s des Premi\u00e8res Nations aux sources de financement du secteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole (pp. 16 \u00e0 18).\n[183] Enfin, le Rapport Wen: De no 3 a constat\u00e9 que la r\u00e9solution des conflits de comp\u00e9tence entre les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces, poursavoir qui devait financer un service particulier, n\u00e9cessitait environ 50,25 heures\/personne, ce qui drainait s\u00e9rieusement les ressources limit\u00e9es des organismes de SEFPN. Par cons\u00e9quent, les auteurs ont recommand\u00e9 la mise en \u0153uvre imm\u00e9diate du principe de Jordan afin de r\u00e9gler les conflits de comp\u00e9tence, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9gration de ce principe dans les ententes de financement conclues entre AADNC et les provinces. Selon le principe de Jordan, le premier qui re\u00e7oit une demande de paiement de service, gouvernement \u2013 f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provincial \u2013 ou minist\u00e8re, doit d\u2019abord payer ce service et r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes de comp\u00e9tence ensuite (Rapport Wen: De no 3, p. 16).\n[184] Le co\u00fbt total de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e9formes recommand\u00e9es par le Rapport Wen: De no 3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9 \u00e0 109,3 millions de dollars. Cette somme se r\u00e9partit ainsi : 22,9 millions pour l\u2019adoption de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes de gestion de l\u2019information, les frais d\u2019immobilisation (immeubles, v\u00e9hicules et \u00e9quipement de bureau) et les primes d\u2019assurance;86,4 millions pour les besoins en financement annuel (p. 33).\n[185] L\u2019AAAP a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue dans le but de combler certaines des lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111 relev\u00e9es dans l\u2019EPN et les rapports Wen: De. Toutefois, malgr\u00e9 la mise en garde \u00e9mise dans le Rapport Wen: De no 3 selon laquelle les changements recommand\u00e9s sont interd\u00e9pendants et leur adoption \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce nuirait \u00e0leur efficacit\u00e9, c\u2019est l\u2019approche qu\u2019AADNC a adopt\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce qui ressort du rapport publi\u00e9 en 2008 par la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur le Programme des SEFPN ainsi que des r\u00e9ponses d\u2019AADNC et des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui suivent.\nRapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\n[186] La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen du Programme des SEFPN d\u2019AADNC,en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande \u00e9crite de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien.Elle a soumis ses conclusions \u00e0 la Chambre des communes en 2008 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 17 [Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada]). La v\u00e9rification portait principalement sur \u00abla structure et les processus de gestion ainsi que sur les ressources utilis\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour appliquer sa politique\u00bb dans les r\u00e9serves (Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, p. 1).\n[187] Le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada r\u00e9it\u00e9rait les conclusions des rapports EPN et Wen: De, en l\u2019occurrence que \u00ab [l]es pratiques de financement actuelles donnent lieu \u00e0 des iniquit\u00e9s en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des fonds au sein des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones et des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, Chapitre 4, p. 2). Voici quelques-unes des conclusions du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada :\nLa formule de financement est p\u00e9rim\u00e9e et ne tient pas compte des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale ou aux changements dans la prestation des services (p. 22,art. 4.51),\nAADNC n\u2019a qu\u2019une assurance limit\u00e9e que les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts dans les r\u00e9serves par les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont conformes \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation et aux normes provinciales. L\u2019ampleur du financement \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 un organisme des Premi\u00e8res Nations est \u00e9tablie sans tenir compte des services que l\u2019organisme est tenu de fournir selon les lois et les normes de la province (pp. 16 et 17, art. 4.30 et 4.34).\nIl n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9finition de ce que l\u2019on entend par \u00ab services raisonnablement comparables \u00bb ou de moyen de v\u00e9rifier si les services offerts dans le cadre du Programme sont vraiment raisonnablement comparables. De plus, d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes sociaux et de sant\u00e9 peuvent compliquer la prestation des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services sociaux et de sant\u00e9, autres que les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance,pour favoriser l\u2019unit\u00e9 de la famille n\u2019est pas le m\u00eame dans les collectivit\u00e9s situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, et il diff\u00e8re \u00e9galement d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation \u00e0 une autre. AADNC n\u2019a pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quels autres services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 sont disponibles dans les r\u00e9serves pour appuyer les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts dans les r\u00e9serves ne peuvent pas \u00eatre comparables si les collectivit\u00e9s dans les r\u00e9serves doivent r\u00e9gler des probl\u00e8mes qui, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, seraient du ressort d\u2019autres services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 (pp. 13 et 14, art. 4.20 et 4.25).\nIl n\u2019y a pas de normes pour guider les organismes de SEFPN charg\u00e9s d\u2019offrir des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles qui r\u00e9pondent aux exigences de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. Le nombre d\u2019organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui re\u00e7oivent des fonds est le principal facteur dont se sert AADNC pour mesurer l\u2019adaptation culturelle. Selon AADNC, le fait que 82 organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s depuis l\u2019adoption de la politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale actuelle signifie qu\u2019un plus grand nombre d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations re\u00e7oivent des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture. Toutefois, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019organismes ne fournissaient qu\u2019une partie restreinte des services alors que les provinces continuaient \u00e0 offrir les autres services. Par ailleurs, AADNC ne sait pas, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale, combien d\u2019enfants pris en charge demeurent dans leur collectivit\u00e9 et combien se retrouvent dans des familles d\u2019accueil ou des institutions des Premi\u00e8res Nations (p. 14, art. 4.24 et 4.25).\nLe mod\u00e8le de financement est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que 6 % des enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves sont pris en charge par les organismes de SEFPN. Cette hypoth\u00e8se donne lieu \u00e0 des iniquit\u00e9s dans le financement des organismes de SEFPN \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le pourcentage d\u2019enfants pris en charge varie grandement d\u2019un organisme \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Par exemple, dans cinq provinces, ce chiffre variait de 0 % \u00e0 28 % (pp. 22-23, art. 4.52).\nLe mod\u00e8le de financement ne tient pas compte des facteurs pouvant faire varier consid\u00e9rablement les co\u00fbts de d\u2019exploitation des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, et la charge de travail des organismes de SEFPN, comme les diff\u00e9rences au plan des besoins des collectivit\u00e9s ou des services de soutien disponibles, (pp. 22-23, art. 4.52).\nLe mod\u00e8le de financement ne convient pas aux petits organismes. Il est bas\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9misse voulant que les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations desservent une collectivit\u00e9 ou un groupe de collectivit\u00e9s des r\u00e9serves o\u00f9 vivent au moins un millier d\u2019enfants. La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a constat\u00e9 que sur les 108 organismes financ\u00e9s par AADNC, 55 offraient des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00e0 moins d\u2019un millier d\u2019enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et que ces organismes n\u2019avaient pas toujours les moyens financiers et la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir les divers services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance n\u00e9cessaires (pp. 24 et 25, art. 4.55 et 4.56).\nAADNC est conscient depuis des ann\u00e9es des lacunes du mod\u00e8le de financement (p. 25, art. 4.57).\n[188] Certaines provinces avaient fait la transition \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP au moment de la r\u00e9daction du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, par cons\u00e9quent le rapport contient \u00e9galement quelques observations au sujet du nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement. Il concluait que m\u00eame si le nouveau mod\u00e8le offrait davantage de financement pour le budget d\u2019exploitation des organismes de SEFPN et plus de souplesse en mati\u00e8re d\u2019allocation des ressources, il ne r\u00e9glait pas les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant du mod\u00e8le actuel. Le nouveau mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9sumait toujours qu\u2019un pourcentage fixe d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations avait besoin de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et par cons\u00e9quent, il ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux diff\u00e9rences de besoins entre les Premi\u00e8res Nations (Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, pp. 26 et 27, art. 4.63\u20114.64).\n[189] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada s\u2019est dite d\u2019avis que :\n[\u2026] la formule de financement ne doit pas \u00eatre simplement un moyen de r\u00e9partir l\u2019enveloppe budg\u00e9taire du Programme.

La r\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pleinement conscient des r\u00e9percussions de son Programme des SEFPN sur les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Il savait, notamment,que le financement qu\u2019il accordait n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux lois et aux normes provinciales. De plus, malgr\u00e9 les lacunes d\u00e9cel\u00e9es dans le nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement, AADNC voyait toujours l\u2019AAAPcomme la r\u00e9ponse aux probl\u00e8mes du Programme des SEFPN :\n4.67 Recommandation.

Comme AADNC s\u2019\u00e9tait dit d\u2019accord avec l\u2019ensemble des recommandations, \u00ab le Comit\u00e9 s\u2019attend[ait] \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il les mette en \u0153uvre int\u00e9gralement\u201d (Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, p. 3).\n[195] Le sous-ministre d\u2019AADNC Michael Wernick a reconnu les lacunes de l\u2019ancienne formule de financement et a mentionn\u00e9 la nouvelle approche :\nAvant, le syst\u00e8me consistait \u00e0 financer les frais de prise en charge des enfants. Alors, on prenait en charge les enfants; beaucoup d\u2019enfants. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les organismes de service n\u2019avaient pas par ailleurs \u00e0 leur disposition tout l\u2019\u00e9ventail des instruments actuels, soit la garde par la parent\u00e9, la garde en foyer nourricier, le placement, la d\u00e9judiciarisation, les services de pr\u00e9vention et ainsi de suite. Les nouvelles ententes de partenariat visent \u00e0 financer les organismes au titre des frais de fonctionnement et d\u2019entretien \u2014 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire essentiellement pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants \u2014 de m\u00eame qu\u2019au titre des services de pr\u00e9vention, et visent \u00e0 leur permettre de passer plus facilement d\u2019un type de service \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\n(Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, p. 9 [renvoi omis])\n[196] Dans son t\u00e9moignage devant le sous-comit\u00e9 permanent, la sous-ministre-adjointe Christine Cram a fait \u00e9cho aux propos du sous-ministre :\nNous appliquons actuellement deux formules. Dans le cas des provinces, nous ne sommes pas pass\u00e9s au nouveau mod\u00e8le et nous remboursons tous les frais aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la prise en charge des enfants. C\u2019est pour cette raison que les co\u00fbts ont tellement augment\u00e9 dans le temps. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit que l\u2019ancienne formule ne permettait pas de financer les organismes pour la mise en \u0153uvre des services de pr\u00e9vention. Cette critique est effectivement justifi\u00e9e pour ce qui est de l\u2019ancienne formule. En vertu de la nouvelle formule, comme le sous-ministre vient de vous le dire, nous appliquons d\u00e9sormais trois cat\u00e9gories de financement : le financement au titre du fonctionnement, le financement des services de pr\u00e9vention, et le financement au chapitre de l\u2019entretien. Chaque cas ob\u00e9it \u00e0 des crit\u00e8res diff\u00e9rents.\n(Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, pp. 9-10 [renvois omis])\n[197] le Comit\u00e9 permanent s\u2019est dit pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que la Directive 20\u20111 continuait \u00e0 s\u2019appliquer dans de nombreuses provinces ainsi qu\u2019au Yukon:\nLe Comit\u00e9 trouve assez pr\u00e9occupant que la majorit\u00e9 des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves continuent d\u2019\u00eatre assujettis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime de financement qui, selon de nombreuses \u00e9tudes, ne fonctionne pas et devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. Selon les auteurs du Joint National Policy Review, \u00ab La formule de financement inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la directive 20\u20111 est d\u00e9su\u00e8te et manque de souplesse \u00bb. Les auteurs du rapport Wen:de publi\u00e9 en 2005 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un examen approfondi des formules de financement utilis\u00e9es pour calculer l\u2019aide consentie aux organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations offrant des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ont constat\u00e9 qu\u2019en vertu de la formule de financement en vigueur, les services d\u2019intervention primaire, secondaire et tertiaire en cas de violence envers les enfants, notamment la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures les moins perturbatrices possible, sont terriblement sous\u2011financ\u00e9s. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans le rapport, \u00ab le manque de services d\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce contribue \u00e0 accro\u00eetre le nombre d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui sont pris en charge et la dur\u00e9e de leur prise en charge \u00bb. Une \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en 2007 par la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019\u00e9valuation et de la v\u00e9rification interne d\u2019AINC recommandait que le Minist\u00e8re \u00ab corrige la lacune du mode de financement du Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb. Selon les conclusions du BVG, \u00ab [t]elle qu\u2019elle est actuellement con\u00e7ue et appliqu\u00e9e, la formule ne permet pas de traiter les Premi\u00e8res Nations et les provinces de fa\u00e7on uniforme et \u00e9quitable. Cette situation se traduit notamment par le fait qu\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves n\u2019ont pas toujours acc\u00e8s aux services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pr\u00e9vus dans la loi provinciale applicable et offerts aux personnes vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves.\nOn continue pourtant d\u2019appliquer cette formule de financement. Comme l\u2019a exprim\u00e9 la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00ab [t]r\u00e8s honn\u00eatement, il y a lieu de se demander pourquoi on continue d\u2019administrer un programme pendant 20 ans, tandis que tout change autour, pourquoi la formule de financement demeure la m\u00eame, pourquoi les services de pr\u00e9vention ne sont pas financ\u00e9s et pourquoi nombre d\u2019enfants sont pris en charge.\nLe Comit\u00e9 appr\u00e9cie les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le Minist\u00e8re pour mettre en place de nouvelles ententes fond\u00e9es sur le mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9vention, mais il ne comprend absolument pas pourquoi l\u2019ancienne formule de financement est toujours en vigueur. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019opter pour la conclusion de nouvelles ententes ne devrait en aucun cas emp\u00eacher l\u2019adoption de mesures pour am\u00e9liorer la formule actuelle, surtout qu\u2019il faudra peut-\u00eatre des ann\u00e9es avant que d\u2019autres ententes ne soient sign\u00e9es avec les provinces. Dans l\u2019intervalle, beaucoup d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont pris en charge alors qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres solutions. Cette situation est inacceptable et nettement injuste.\n(Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, pp. 10-11 [renvois omis])\n[198] Le Comit\u00e9 permanent a souscrit aux commentaires de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au sujet du fait que le nouveau mod\u00e8lede financement de l\u2019AAAP ne r\u00e9glait pas les iniquit\u00e9s d\u00e9cel\u00e9es dans la Directive 20\u20111 (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les hypoth\u00e8ses relatives au pourcentage d\u2019enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations ayant besoin de services int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans le mod\u00e8le) :\nLe Comit\u00e9 est tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord, surtout que le Minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait au courant du probl\u00e8me pos\u00e9 par l\u2019ancienne formule, mais l\u2019a malgr\u00e9 tout reproduit dans la nouvelle formule. Le Comit\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7u de voir que le Minist\u00e8re adopte une approche bureaucratique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du financement des organismes, plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019efforcer d\u2019orienter le financement l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il en existe un besoin. \u00c0 cause de cela, les collectivit\u00e9s qui ont le plus besoin de financement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celles o\u00f9 la proportion d\u2019enfants pris en charge d\u00e9passe 6 %, continueront d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011financ\u00e9es et ne seront pas en mesure d\u2019offrir \u00e0 leurs enfants les services dont ils ont besoin.

Pourtant, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 comment le financement consenti aux organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations offrant des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille se compare \u00e0 celui des organismes de services destin\u00e9s aux non\u2011Autochtones, la sous\u2011ministre adjointe a dit : \u00ab Excusez\u2011moi, mais je n\u2019ai actuellement pas la r\u00e9ponse. \u00bb La m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e au sous-ministre qui a r\u00e9pondu ceci : \u00ab Nous sommes responsables des services offerts par les organismes dans les r\u00e9serves dans la mesure o\u00f9 nous les finan\u00e7ons \u00bb.\nLe Comit\u00e9 trouve ces r\u00e9ponses assez d\u00e9cevantes. La r\u00e9ponse du sous-ministre est insatisfaisante puisque la question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude est justement le niveau de financement accord\u00e9 aux organismes. De m\u00eame, le fait que le sous-ministre et la sous-ministre-adjointe ne savent pas comment le financement se compare \u00e0 celui des organismes provinciaux incite le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019interroger sur la fa\u00e7on dont le niveau de financement est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Minist\u00e8re peut \u00eatre s\u00fbr que le traitement offert aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations est \u00e9quitable.\n[\u2026]\nComme la politique exige que les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations soient comparables aux services offerts \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves et que, de l\u2019avis du Comit\u00e9, les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s \u00e9quitablement, il serait normal qu\u2019AINC dispose de renseignements \u00e9toff\u00e9s sur le niveau de financement offert aux organismes provinciaux d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pour pouvoir les comparer au niveau de financement des organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019AINC doit adopter une formule de financement provinciale pour les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, puisque les besoins de ces organismes sont particuliers et souvent plus grands.

De plus, AINC s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner la Directive 20-1.\n(R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, Introduction)\n[202] AADNC a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit \u00e0 la recommandation qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une comparaison exhaustive de son financement avec le financement provincial:\nAINC accepte cette recommandation en sachant qu\u2019une analyse comparative ne peut \u00eatre fournie qu\u2019avec les donn\u00e9es limit\u00e9es auxquelles le Minist\u00e8re a acc\u00e8s et sur une base \u00e9tapiste. Ce travail requerra beaucoup de temps et d\u2019efforts avec les provinces et les Premi\u00e8res Nations. L\u2019information disponible dans les rapports annuels provinciaux est de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et le financement fourni au titre de leurs services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance comprend souvent des programmes allant au-del\u00e0 des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Globalement, ces rapports provinciaux ne contiennent pas le degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9tail requis pour effectuer le genre de comparaison compl\u00e8te pr\u00e9vue par le Comit\u00e9. Les relations doivent \u00eatre renforc\u00e9es avec les partenaires provinciaux puisqu\u2019ils sont essentiels afin de fournir \u00e0 AINC l\u2019information n\u00e9cessaire concernant le financement de son programme de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Les provinces doivent aussi accepter de permettre \u00e0 AINC de rendre cette information publique.\nIl faut remarquer qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la complexit\u00e9 de la prestation des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance partout au pays, la comparabilit\u00e9 entre les organismes des SEFPN et les fournisseurs provinciaux dans les r\u00e9serves de services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est un d\u00e9fi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les provinces sont offerts de diverses fa\u00e7ons. Les services peuvent varier selon la comp\u00e9tence bas\u00e9e sur le besoin; \u00eatre fournis directement par les provinces, ou par des responsables d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la province ou les responsables r\u00e9gionaux et de district. Une province peut aussi financer des organismes pour donner les services et\/ou conclure des contrats avec des tiers.\nAINC ne peut donc s\u2019engager \u00e0 effectuer un examen complet de cette nature et cela ne peut pas \u00eatre fait dans toutes les comp\u00e9tences dans le d\u00e9lai requis par le Comit\u00e9. AINC serait en mesure de fournir une comparaison de base des comp\u00e9tences qui rel\u00e8vent actuellement de l\u2019Approche ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention rehauss\u00e9e et lorsque AINC a de l\u2019information de base sur les salaires et les ratios du nombre de cas. AINC s\u2019attend \u00e0 terminer la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de ce travail avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n\u00c0 mesure qu\u2019AINC va de l\u2019avant dans la transition des autres comp\u00e9tences et que des relations sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es avec chaque province par le truchement des tables tripartites, AINC sera en meilleure posture pour effectuer une comparaison du financement des organismes des SEFPN et des syst\u00e8mes provinciaux. Cette \u00e9tape sera compos\u00e9e des provinces avec lesquelles AINC n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 ou termin\u00e9 des cadres de responsabilisation tripartites. Cette \u00e9tape devrait \u00eatre termin\u00e9e d\u2019ici 2012.\n(R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, Recommandation 2 \u2013 Comparaison provinciale)\n[203] Voici ce qu\u2019AADNC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la recommandation qu\u2019il r\u00e9vise le mod\u00e8le de financement pour fournir un financement fond\u00e9 sur les besoins:\nIl est important de noter que le nombre moyen de 6 p. cent d\u2019enfants dans les calculs de prise en charge est un des nombreux facteurs utilis\u00e9s uniquement pour mod\u00e9liser le financement des co\u00fbts d\u2019exploitation qui comprend le nombre de travailleurs en services de protection. Ceci est ensuite traduit dans une portion du financement d\u2019exploitation re\u00e7u par l\u2019organisme. Ce chiffre de 6 p. cent a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de discussions avec les directeurs des organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations et les repr\u00e9sentants des provinces et on consid\u00e9rait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait assez repr\u00e9sentatif des besoins globaux dans les collectivit\u00e9s. Dans l\u2019Approche ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention rehauss\u00e9e, les organismes des SEFPN ont la souplesse de transf\u00e9rer les fonds d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 une autre afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins pr\u00e9cis dans la collectivit\u00e9. Ce mod\u00e8le d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts fournit \u00e0 tous les organismes des SEFPN dans la nouvelle approche les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour offrir une gamme plus \u00e9largie de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\nPar l\u2019entremise de discussions avec les partenaires provinciaux et des Premi\u00e8res Nations, il est clair que ceux-ci pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un mod\u00e8le d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts qui fournirait aux r\u00e9cipiendaires un financement stable pour l\u2019exploitation. La majorit\u00e9 des partenaires ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019appuieraient pas un mod\u00e8le qui g\u00e9n\u00e9rait plus de ressources pour les r\u00e9cipiendaires bas\u00e9 sur un pourcentage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019enfants pris en charge. De plus, ce mod\u00e8le assure que les organismes des SEFPN travaillant dans les collectivit\u00e9s o\u00f9 les populations sont moins nombreuses re\u00e7oivent suffisamment de fonds pour faire fonctionner les programmes de pr\u00e9vention et de protection. Sans la formule de pourcentage fixe utilis\u00e9e pour calculer et financer l\u2019exploitation, les organismes ayant un tr\u00e8s faible pourcentage d\u2019enfants pris en charge n\u2019auraient pas les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour fonctionner. De plus, si le budget d\u2019exploitation \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 sur le besoin plut\u00f4t que sur un pourcentage fixe, les organismes pourraient conna\u00eetre des budgets d\u2019exploitation qui changent consid\u00e9rablement d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre, ce qui entraverait leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 planifier et \u00e0 donner leurs services. Les nouveaux mod\u00e8les d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts pr\u00e9voient un budget stable d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention qui ne d\u00e9pend pas du nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge comme un de ses d\u00e9terminants.\n(R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, Recommandation 5 \u2013 Formule de financement bas\u00e9e sur le besoin)\n[204] En 2011, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est revenue sur la r\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC aux recommandations \u00e9mises dans le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et dans le Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics.\nRapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011)\n[205] En 2011, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada a entrepris de mesurer les progr\u00e8s accomplis par AADNC dans la mise en \u0153uvre des recommandations du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et du Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 20 [Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011)]).\n[206] La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a signal\u00e9 que m\u00eame si AADNC s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019il entendait par \u00ab services raisonnablement comparables \u00bb, il n\u2019en avait rien fait.

De plus, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019AADNC n\u2019avait pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision tous les services sociaux offerts dans les provinces afin de d\u00e9terminer si les services offerts aux enfants dans les r\u00e9serves \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 ceux offerts aux enfants hors r\u00e9serve (Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 31, art. 4.49).\n[207] La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa conclusion ant\u00e9rieure selon laquelle le nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019AAAP ne r\u00e9glait pas toutes les disparit\u00e9s de financement qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9es dans le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada. Tout en reconnaissant que l\u2019AAAP permettait d\u2019offrir des services qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9vus par la Directive 20\u20111, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que :\n[\u2026] comme le Minist\u00e8re n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il entendait par \u00ab services comparables \u00bb, il n\u2019est pas en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que sa nouvelle approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention permet d\u2019offrir des services aux enfants et aux familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves qui sont raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux des provinces.\n(Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 31, art. 4.50 et 4.51)\n[208] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la recommandation qu\u2019AADNC \u00ab d\u00e9termine les co\u00fbts entiers n\u00e9cessaires au respect des exigences du Programme des SEFPN \u00bb, le Minist\u00e8re a accept\u00e9 de mettre \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le co\u00fbt estimatif de la mise en \u0153uvre du Programme selon la nouvelle approche de financement de l\u2019AAAP, par province, et de revoir p\u00e9riodiquement le budget du Programme. La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019AADNC avait chiffr\u00e9 les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la prestation des services dans chaque province avant la transition vers l\u2019AAAP. AADNC a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait besoin d\u2019une augmentation de son budget pour les frais d\u2019exploitation et les services de pr\u00e9vention de l\u2019ordre de 50 \u00e0 100 % pour chaque province pass\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP. Compte tenu de tous les co\u00fbts, l\u2019AAAP avait entra\u00een\u00e9, en moyenne, une augmentation de plus de 40 % du co\u00fbt du Programme des SEFPN dans les provinces participantes (Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 32, art. 4.53 et 4.54). \u00c0 ce propos, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que le budget du Programme des SEFPN avait augment\u00e9 de 32 % depuis l\u2019exercice 2005\u20112006, et que cette hausse s\u2019expliquait en partie par les fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires pour la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP (Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 32, art. 4.55).\n[209] La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rappel\u00e9 la demande du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics qu\u2019AANDC proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une comparaison exhaustive du financement accord\u00e9 aux organismes de SEFPN et de celui consenti par les provinces \u00e0 des organismes semblables. Elle a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, AADNC avait compar\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s du fonctionnement de ses programmes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, offerts tant dans les r\u00e9serves qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, avec ceux des provinces. Il a notamment compar\u00e9 les salaires et les avantages des travailleurs sociaux, en vue de n\u00e9gociations-cadres avec les provinces. AADNC n\u2019a toutefois pas fourni d\u2019informations au Comit\u00e9 quant au nombre de dossiers trait\u00e9s par les travailleurs sociaux, d\u00e9clarant que ces renseignements n\u2019\u00e9taient pas du domaine public. De plus, AADNC affirmait que certains services fournis par les provinces, comme les services de sant\u00e9 ou de justice des mineurs, ne relevaient pas de son mandat (Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 33, art. 4.56 et 4.57).\n[210] Voici l\u2019essentiel des constats de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite de son examen des programmes destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves, y compris son suivi des progr\u00e8s r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par AADNC dans la mise en \u0153uvre de certaines des recommandations du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada :\nEn d\u00e9pit des nombreux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour donner suite \u00e0 nos recommandations et am\u00e9liorer les programmes destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res nations, nous constatons que la qualit\u00e9 de vie et le bien-\u00eatre des personnes vivant dans les r\u00e9serves ne se sont pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9s. Les services offerts dans les r\u00e9serves sont rarement comparables \u00e0 ceux offerts ailleurs par les provinces ou les municipalit\u00e9s. Les conditions de vie dans les r\u00e9serves restent m\u00e9diocres. Des changements sont n\u00e9cessaires si l\u2019on veut que les Premi\u00e8res nations profitent davantage des services qui leur sont offerts. Nous sommes conscients que les probl\u00e8mes que nous soulevons sont complexes et qu\u2019il faudra des efforts concert\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et des Premi\u00e8res nations pour y rem\u00e9dier, en collaboration avec les gouvernements provinciaux et les autres parties concern\u00e9es.\nNous croyons que des obstacles structurels ont entrav\u00e9 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie des Premi\u00e8res nations dans les r\u00e9serves. Selon nous, pour am\u00e9liorer r\u00e9ellement la qualit\u00e9 de vie dans les r\u00e9serves, il faut clarifier le niveau des services \u00e0 assurer; instaurer un fondement l\u00e9gislatif pour les programmes; octroyer un financement proportionn\u00e9 qui serait prescrit par la loi au lieu de recourir \u00e0 des politiques et \u00e0 des accords de contributions; et avoir des organisations veillant \u00e0 la prestation des services par les Premi\u00e8res nations. Il faut r\u00e9unir ces quatre conditions pour permettre aux Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une qualit\u00e9 de vie avoisinant celle des Canadiens de partout au pays. Il faut aussi accorder une plus grande importance \u00e0 l\u2019obtention de r\u00e9sultats.\nNous sommes conscients que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut pas instaurer tous ces changements structurels lui-m\u00eame, car cela aurait une incidence profonde sur les rapports qu\u2019il entretient avec les Premi\u00e8res nations. Pour cette raison, les Premi\u00e8res nations elles-m\u00eames devront jouer un r\u00f4le de premier plan en vue de concr\u00e9tiser ces changements. Elles devront participer activement \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de normes de service et aux d\u00e9cisions visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer comment faire appliquer et respecter ces normes. Elles devront aussi participer \u00e9troitement aux r\u00e9formes l\u00e9gislatives, et diriger conjointement les discussions visant \u00e0 d\u00e9finir des m\u00e9canismes de financement cr\u00e9dibles qui soient fonctionnels sur le plan administratif et qui garantissent une gouvernance fond\u00e9e sur la responsabilit\u00e9 au sein des Premi\u00e8res nations. Elles devront jouer un r\u00f4le actif dans la cr\u00e9ation et la gestion de nouvelles organisations qui veilleront \u00e0 assurer la prestation des services au sein de leurs collectivit\u00e9s.\nL\u2019\u00e9limination de ces obstacles structurels repr\u00e9sentera un d\u00e9fi. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les Premi\u00e8res nations devront d\u00e9cider ensemble comment ils surmonteront les nombreuses difficult\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9senteront certainement. S\u2019ils ne rel\u00e8vent pas ce d\u00e9fi, cependant, les conditions de vie dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res nations pourraient continuer d\u2019\u00eatre moins bonnes que dans le reste du Canada pour des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00e0 venir.\n(Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), p. 6.)\nRapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012)\n[211] En f\u00e9vrier 2012, le Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics a publi\u00e9 un rapport dans la foul\u00e9e du Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011) (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 21 [Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012)]).\n[212] Le sous-ministre d\u2019AADNC, Michael Wernick, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 devant le Comit\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec le BVG sur la d\u00e9finition du probl\u00e8me [\u2026] \u00bb (Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012), p. 4).

En outre, le sous-ministre d\u2019AADNC s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les obstacles structurels relev\u00e9s par le BVG. Tout comme le sous-ministre, le Comit\u00e9 croit que des progr\u00e8s sont possibles, mais que des r\u00e9formes structurelles majeures et un int\u00e9r\u00eat soutenu de la direction seront n\u00e9cessaires. Le Comit\u00e9 est d\u2019avis qu\u2019AADNC, de concert avec d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res, doit \u00e9laborer un plan d\u2019action et s\u2019engager \u00e0 le respecter afin de prendre les mesures qui s\u2019imposent; et le Comit\u00e9 a l\u2019intention de suivre l\u2019\u00e9volution des progr\u00e8s accomplis par le gouvernement afin que les Premi\u00e8res nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves voient une nette am\u00e9lioration de leur situation sociale et \u00e9conomique.\n(Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012), p.16.\n[215] Le ministre d\u2019AADNC de l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. John Duncan, a r\u00e9pondu au Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012) (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 22 [R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012)]). Le ministre Duncan a notamment reconnu ce qui suit :\nJe voudrais \u00e9galement souligner les travaux du Bureau du v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qui fournit au Parlement, au gouvernement du Canada et \u00e0 la population canadienne des renseignements pr\u00e9cieux sur l\u2019approche du Canada dans la prestation de programmes destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves. La pr\u00e9face de six pages du chapitre 4 du Rapport Le Point 2011 constitue, \u00e0 mes yeux, un outil important qui aidera le Parlement \u00e0 mieux comprendre les enjeux autochtones.\n[\u2026]\nJe conviens qu\u2019un grand nombre de probl\u00e8mes auxquels sont confront\u00e9s les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont caus\u00e9s par les obstacles structurels cibl\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir un manque de pr\u00e9cisions concernant les niveaux de services, une absence de fondement l\u00e9gislatif, une absence de m\u00e9canismes de financement ad\u00e9quats, et un manque d\u2019organisations capables d\u2019appuyer la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle locale.\n[\u2026]\nDes pr\u00e9cisions au sujet des niveaux de services et la comparabilit\u00e9 des services et des niveaux de financement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations et six provinces ont adopt\u00e9 cette nouvelle approche.\n[\u2026]\nLe Bureau du v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a trait\u00e9 des d\u00e9fis associ\u00e9s au recours aux accords de contribution pour financer des programmes et services destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ainsi, les accords ne pr\u00e9cisent pas toujours les normes de services \u00e0 respecter ou les r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 atteindre; les accords doivent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9s chaque ann\u00e9e et ils ne pr\u00e9cisent pas toujours clairement qui doit rendre des comptes aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour ce qui est de l\u2019obtention de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats. De plus, les accords de contribution imposent un important fardeau associ\u00e9 aux rapports, et les collectivit\u00e9s ont souvent des ressources administratives insuffisantes pour satisfaire aux nombreuses exigences qu\u2019ils contiennent concernant la production de rapports.\nLe gouvernement du Canada est conscient que le fait de se fonder sur des ententes annuelles de financement et que le financement provenant de nombreuses sources impose des obligations redditionnelles multiples peut nuire \u00e0 la prestation de services en temps opportun et limiter la capacit\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res Nations de mettre en \u0153uvre des plans de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 long terme.\nAfin de prendre en compte ces pr\u00e9occupations, Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada met en place une approche ax\u00e9e sur le risque pour simplifier les ententes de financement et les exigences en mati\u00e8re de rapports. L\u2019outil d\u2019\u00e9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale offre une plus grande souplesse en \u00e9valuant la capacit\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019autres approches de financement, notamment les ententes pluriannuelles. De plus, dans le cadre d\u2019un projet pilote, on met actuellement en \u0153uvre dans 11 collectivit\u00e9s de Premi\u00e8res nations une nouvelle approche de la pr\u00e9paration de rapports qui accro\u00eet la transparence et la responsabilisation des collectivit\u00e9s, en se servant du site Web des Premi\u00e8res Nations comme d\u2019un outil de d\u00e9claration et en r\u00e9glant les probl\u00e8mes de capacit\u00e9s associ\u00e9s au fardeau des rapports.\n(R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012))\n[216] L\u2019EPN, les rapports Wen:De et les rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et du Comit\u00e9 permanent ont tous relev\u00e9 des lacunes dans le financement et la structure du Programme des SEFPN. Ces lacunes ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es par les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis et sur lesquels nous reviendrons plus loin. Nous exposerons toutefois en premier lieu les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant le financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019Entente de 1965 de l\u2019Ontario ainsi que des autres ententes provinciales conclues en Alberta et en Colombie-Britannique.\nc. L\u2019Entente de 1965 conclue avec l\u2019Ontario\n[217] La preuve soumise au Tribunal r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement l\u2019existence de lacunes dans le financement et la structure de l\u2019Entente de 1965 conclue avec la province de l\u2019Ontario.\n[218] En 1965, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a conclu avec la province de l\u2019Ontario une entente permettant \u00e0 celle\u2011ci d\u2019offrir des services sociaux, notamment des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves. Vers la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, les autorit\u00e9s de protection de l\u2019enfance de l\u2019Ontario ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 retirer un nombre important d\u2019enfants autochtones de leurs foyers et de leurs collectivit\u00e9s : c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on a appel\u00e9 \u00ab la rafle des ann\u00e9es soixante \u00bb. Mme Theresa Stevens, directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Anishinaabe Abinooji Child and Family Services de Kenora, en Ontario, a racont\u00e9 que des autobus arrivaient dans des collectivit\u00e9s et en repartaient avec tous les enfants (Transcription, vol. 25, p. 28 \u00e0 30). Comme nous l\u2019expliquerons plus loin en d\u00e9tail, le traumatisme collectif v\u00e9cu par bon nombre des Premi\u00e8res Nations ontariennes \u00e0 la suite de la rafle des ann\u00e9es soixante permet de mieux comprendre le contexte dans lequel sont fournis les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille en Ontario. Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet les souffrances v\u00e9cues par les enfants, les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones en raison de la rafle des ann\u00e9es soixante.\n[219] L\u2019Entente de 1965 est une entente bilat\u00e9rale qui pr\u00e9voit un partage des co\u00fbts et aux termes de laquelle l\u2019Ontario fournit ou paie des services admissibles et facture ensuite le Canada pour sa part des co\u00fbts de ces services, conform\u00e9ment au mod\u00e8le de partage des co\u00fbts. Les services admissibles au partage des co\u00fbts aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965 sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans l\u2019Annexe de l\u2019entente. M. Phil Digby, directeur des Programmes sociaux du Bureau r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Ontario d\u2019AADNC, a expliqu\u00e9 le fonctionnement de l\u2019Entente de 1965 lors de l\u2019audience. Au d\u00e9but de chaque exercice financier, l\u2019Ontario soumet \u00e0 AADNC ses pr\u00e9visions de tr\u00e9sorerie. Une fois ces pr\u00e9visions approuv\u00e9es, AADNC fournit \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario une avance de fonds d\u2019un mois, suivie de versements mensuels. AADNC retient 10 % sur chaque paiement et le remet (sans ajustement) \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s une v\u00e9rification comptable. Il n\u2019y a pas de plafond g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des d\u00e9penses aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965.\n[220] La formule de partage des co\u00fbts est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Elle est fond\u00e9e sur deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Le premier est [traduction] \u00ab le co\u00fbt par personne du volet Aide financi\u00e8re du programme g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019aide sociale ontarien offert aux personnes autres que les Indiens inscrits vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en Ontario \u00bb. Le second est [traduction] \u00ab le co\u00fbt par personne du volet Aide financi\u00e8re du programme g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019aide sociale ontarien offert aux Indiens inscrits vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en Ontario \u00bb.\n[221] Selon M. Digby, l\u2019aide sociale est le domaine dans lequel on dispose des meilleures donn\u00e9es permettant de se faire une bonne id\u00e9e de la part proportionnelle et de la part relative des co\u00fbts dans les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations par rapport au reste de l\u2019Ontario. En 2011\u20112012, il en co\u00fbtait en moyenne environ 200 $ par personne pour offrir de l\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 une personne ne vivant pas dans une r\u00e9serve. Dans le cas d\u2019une personne des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve, ce chiffre oscillait autour de 1 200 $. La part des co\u00fbts assum\u00e9e par AADNC est calcul\u00e9e en prenant 50 % de ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte en moyenne pour fournir de l\u2019aide sociale aux personnes vivant hors des r\u00e9serves (200 x 0,50 = 100) et en divisant ce chiffre par ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte en moyenne pour fournir de l\u2019aide sociale aux personnes vivant dans des r\u00e9serves (100\/1200 = 0,0833). Puis on soustrait ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte en moyenne pour fournir de l\u2019aide sociale aux personnes vivant hors des r\u00e9serves de ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte en moyenne pour fournir de l\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des personnes vivant dans des r\u00e9serves (1200 \u2013 200 = 1000) et on divise ce chiffre par ce qu\u2019il en co\u00fbte en moyenne pour fournir de l\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des personnes vivant dans des r\u00e9serves (1000\/1200 = 0,8333. Ensuite, on additionne ces deux chiffres pour en arriver \u00e0 un rapport du partage des co\u00fbts (0,0833 + 0,8333 = 0,9166). Selon ces chiffres, AADNC payait environ 92 % des frais admissibles aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965 en 2011\u20112012. Selon M. Digby, la formule de partage des co\u00fbts de l\u2019Entente de 1965 reconna\u00eet le co\u00fbt plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 par personne de l\u2019aide sociale fournie aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, ainsi que l\u2019engagement d\u2019AADNC d\u2019assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re de ces frais additionnels (t\u00e9moignage de P. Digby, Transcription, vol. 59, p. 24 \u00e0 28).\n[222] La province de l\u2019Ontario a recours \u00e0 deux m\u00e9canismes pour fournir des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves : (i) les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, y compris les organismes provinciaux de protection de l\u2019enfance et, les organismes de SEFPN; (ii) des contrats de service pour la prestation de services de pr\u00e9vention. Il existe sept organismes de SEFPN pleinement mandat\u00e9s en Ontario, financ\u00e9s selon le m\u00eame mod\u00e8le que les organismes provinciaux de protection de l\u2019enfance en Ontario. Il y a aussi six organismes de SEFPN \u00ab pr\u00e9\u2011mandat\u00e9s \u00bb qui ne disposent pas d\u2019un plein mandat de protection et qui sont en train de d\u00e9velopper leurs capacit\u00e9s pour devenir des organismes de SEFPN pleinement mandat\u00e9s. Environ 25 r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations re\u00e7oivent des services de pr\u00e9vention par le biais de contrats de service.\n[223] AANDC n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9vis\u00e9 l\u2019Entente de 1965. Les dispositions de l\u2019entente portant sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 jour depuis 1981 et les Annexes de l\u2019entente n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 actualis\u00e9es depuis 1998. Cette situation est d\u2019autant plus significative qu\u2019en 1984, l\u2019Ontario a adopt\u00e9 la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille en y int\u00e9grant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019autres textes l\u00e9gislatifs (par exemple, la justice pour adolescents et la sant\u00e9 mentale) pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des Ontariens en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le gouvernement du Canada avait adopt\u00e9 le point de vue qu\u2019AADNC n\u2019avait pas le mandat ni les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour commencer \u00e0 financer des programmes en mati\u00e8re de justice et de sant\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce type de programme relevait d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res (t\u00e9moignage de P. Digby, Transcription, vol. 59, p. 69).\n[224] En 2000, l\u2019EPN a recommand\u00e9 que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision tripartite de l\u2019Entente de 1965 (p. 18 et 121). Le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada signalait par ailleurs que l\u2019Entente de 1965 comprenait des dispositions pr\u00e9voyant sa mise \u00e0 jour que l\u2019on pouvait les invoquer pour s\u2019assurer que l\u2019Entente et les services pay\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral soient actualis\u00e9s.\n[225] L\u2019absence de mise \u00e0 jour de l\u2019Entente de 1965 en fonction de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e par M. Digby dans un document de travail de 2007 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 23 [1965 Agreement Overview]). Le Tribunal conclut que le document 1965 Agreement Overview est un document pertinent et fiable, d\u2019autant plus que M. Digby est un de ses auteurs. Selon le document de travail intitul\u00e9 1965 Agreement Overview \u00e0 la page 4, plusieurs acteurs concern\u00e9s ont exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes concernant l\u2019Entente de 1965 et sa mise en \u0153uvre, notamment les suivantes:\n[traduction]\nL\u2019entente est bilat\u00e9rale et non tripartite, puisque les Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 faire partie des signataires en 1965. Bien que l\u2019article 2.2 de l\u2019Entente de 1965 pr\u00e9voie que les bandes doivent donner leur accord \u00e0 la prestation de programmes provinciaux d\u2019aide sociale, cette disposition ne correspond pas au type de relation intergouvernementale recherch\u00e9e par bon nombre des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[\u2026]\nLes Premi\u00e8res Nations et le gouvernement provincial se sont, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, montr\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 ce qu\u2019INAC \u00e9largisse le partage des co\u00fbts \u00e0 d\u2019autres programmes de services sociaux provinciaux dans les r\u00e9serves. AINC n\u2019a, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, pas dispos\u00e9 des ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00ab ouvrir \u00bb de nouveaux secteurs \u00e0 un partage des co\u00fbts [\u2026] L\u2019Annexe de l\u2019entente n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour en ce qui concerne le partage des co\u00fbts des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Comme plusieurs programmes relevant de la loi provinciale sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille outrepassent le cadre du mandat d\u2019AINC, le Minist\u00e8re n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019\u00ab ouvrir \u00bb des discussions sur le partage des co\u00fbts de l\u2019ensemble des programmes vis\u00e9s par la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[226] En 2011, la Commission de promotion de la viabilit\u00e9 des services de bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance (la CPVSBE) a publi\u00e9 un document de travail concernant la protection des enfants autochtones en Ontario (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 24 [le Document de travail de la CPVSBE]) La CPVSBE a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le ministre des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la jeunesse de l\u2019Ontario, en vue d\u2019\u00e9laborer et de mettre en \u0153uvre des solutions susceptibles de promouvoir la viabilit\u00e9 des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. La Commission rend compte au ministre. Compte-tenu de ce mandat public, le Tribunal estime que le document de travail de la Commission est pertinent et fiable sur la question de la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves en Ontario.\n[227] Le Document de travail de la CPVSBE commence, \u00e0 la page 4, par expliquer le poids de l\u2019histoire pour bon nombre de collectivit\u00e9s autochtones :\nLa combinaison des effets de la colonisation, des pensionnats, de la rafle des ann\u00e9es 1960 et d\u2019autres facteurs ont min\u00e9 les cultures autochtones, \u00e9rod\u00e9 le r\u00f4le parental et jou\u00e9 contre l\u2019autonomie \u00e9conomique. De nombreux Autochtones vivent dans des communaut\u00e9s ravag\u00e9es par la pauvret\u00e9, l\u2019alcoolisme et la toxicomanie et qui enregistrent des taux de suicide, d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et de ch\u00f4mage tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s, outre d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes sociaux. Les enfants autochtones sont largement surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le secteur des services de bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance et dans le syst\u00e8me de justice pour les jeunes. Les taux de suicide sont environ cinq fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s parmi les enfants et les jeunes autochtones que parmi leurs homologues non autochtones. Les adolescentes autochtones sont neuf fois plus susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre enceintes avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 18 ans, et les jeunes autochtones dans leur ensemble sont beaucoup moins susceptibles de terminer leurs \u00e9tudes secondaires et beaucoup plus susceptibles de vivre dans la pauvret\u00e9 et d\u2019avoir des troubles affectifs et des probl\u00e8mes de toxicomanie.\n[228] Malgr\u00e9 ces facteurs de risque pr\u00e9cis relev\u00e9s chez les peuples autochtones, le Document de travail de la CPVSBE signale que bon nombre d\u2019organismes provinciaux d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance accordent peu d\u2019attention aux exigences de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille qu\u2019ils doivent respecter dans la prestation de services aux enfants autochtones(p. 29). Le document de travail cite notamment les articles 213 et 213.1 de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Ces dispositions obligent les organismes fournissant des services aux enfants autochtones \u00e0 consulter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la bande ou la communaut\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant, habituellement par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de la bande, au sujet des services qui lui sont offerts, y compris la prise en charge d\u2019enfants, la prestation de services de soutien \u00e0 la famille et l\u2019\u00e9laboration de programmes de soins \u00e0 fournir aux enfants.\n[229] Selon le Document de travail de la CPVSBE, les repr\u00e9sentants de bande peuvent jouer un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant et exercent habituellement les fonctions suivantes : Ils servent de lien principal entre une bande et une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ils forment et conseillent les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance sur le plan culturel. Ils supervisent les ententes relatives aux soins temporaires et les ententes relatives aux services b\u00e9n\u00e9voles conclues avec les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ils se chargent d\u2019obtenir des ressources juridiques et participent aux instances judiciaires. Ils veillent \u00e0 ce que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance r\u00e9pondent aux besoins culturels des enfants et enfin, ils participent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de plans de soins pour les enfants (p. 30).\n[230] Le Document de travail de la CPVSBE rappelle que, par le pass\u00e9, certaines Premi\u00e8res Nations qui en faisaient la demande recevaient un financement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour recruter un repr\u00e9sentant de bande. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s la suppression de ces subventions en 2003, certaines Premi\u00e8res Nations ont d\u00fb puiser dans les fonds qui \u00e9taient consacr\u00e9es aux services de pr\u00e9vention pour couvrir les co\u00fbts d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant, alors que d\u2019autres collectivit\u00e9s n\u2019ont tout simplement pas de repr\u00e9sentants de bande (Document de travail de la CPVSBE, p. 30).\n[231] Le document de travail pr\u00e9cise par ailleurs que la prestation de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance aux communaut\u00e9s isol\u00e9es et \u00e9loign\u00e9es du Nord de l\u2019Ontario pose des d\u00e9fis pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, il en co\u00fbte plus cher et il faut davantage de temps pour atteindre les collectivit\u00e9s desservies, dont certaines ne disposent pas d\u2019acc\u00e8s routier \u00e0 longueur d\u2019ann\u00e9e et o\u00f9 l\u2019avion est le seul moyen de transport possible. D\u2019ailleurs, un organisme s\u2019est vu contraint d\u2019effectuer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 80 vols par jour.\n[232] Un autre d\u00e9fi qui se pose pour les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es est le recrutement et la r\u00e9tention de personnel, en particulier d\u2019employ\u00e9s qualifi\u00e9s issus de leurs propres communaut\u00e9s. Le souvenir de la rafle des ann\u00e9es soixante et l\u2019association faite entre les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et le retrait des enfants de leur collectivit\u00e9 ont suscit\u00e9, chez certains membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations, du ressentiment ou de la r\u00e9sistance envers les travailleurs des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ces r\u00e9actions peuvent engendrer de l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 dans le milieu de travail.\n[233] Le document de travail mentionne la p\u00e9nurie de logements convenables parmi les autres difficult\u00e9s auxquelles font face les collectivit\u00e9s autochtones \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es Cette p\u00e9nurie rend difficile le recrutement de personnel de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la collectivit\u00e9 et la recherche de familles d\u2019accueil appropri\u00e9es. Il souligne \u00e9galement l\u2019acc\u00e8s limit\u00e9 aux tribunaux et le manque d\u2019autres services de soutien \u2013 programmes sociaux ou de sant\u00e9, ce qui a une incidence sur le rendement et sur la qualit\u00e9 des services fournis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (Document de travail de la CPVSBE, pp. 32 et 33). Sur ce dernier point, le Document de travail de la CPVSBE souligne le fait que \u00ab [l]\u2019obtention de r\u00e9sultats positifs pour les enfants, les familles et les communaut\u00e9s n\u00e9cessite un \u00e9ventail complet de services li\u00e9s aux conditions m\u00e9dicales, sociales et \u00e9conomiques de la communaut\u00e9; \u00e0 eux seuls, les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre suffisants \u00bb (p. 33).\n[234] Le Document de travail de la CPVSBE signale \u00e9galement qu\u2019il existe plusieurs diff\u00e9rences marqu\u00e9es entre les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance autochtones et non autochtones en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services. En effet, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance autochtones desservent des zones g\u00e9ographiques beaucoup plus vastes et moins dens\u00e9ment peupl\u00e9es, qui comptent moins d\u2019enfants et d\u2019adolescents. Elles traitent des milliers de cas de plus et desservent plus d\u2019enfants et de d\u2019adolescents plac\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que r\u00e9sidant dans leur propre famille. Leurs d\u00e9penses totales sont inf\u00e9rieures, mais leurs d\u00e9penses par personne et par cas sont sensiblement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es (Document de travail de la CPVSBE, p. 33 et 34).\n[235] Enfin, le Document de travail de la CPVSBE aborde le sujet de la dynamique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale-provinciale en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves. Il souligne qu\u2019au lieu de collaborer pour offrir des services efficaces aux peuples autochtones, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 certaines de ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers les peuples autochtones aux gouvernements provinciaux. Ce faisant, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une certaine ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9limitation des comp\u00e9tences (Document de travail de la CPVSBE, p. 38 et 39).\n[236] En 2007, le minist\u00e8re des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la jeunesse de l\u2019Ontario a \u00e9crit \u00e0 AADNC pour lui faire part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019AADNC de ne plus financer les repr\u00e9sentants de bande : [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 la suite du retrait du financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, bon nombre des Premi\u00e8res Nations ne disposent plus des ressources financi\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires pour participer \u00e0 la planification des dossiers des enfants et des familles autochtones recevant des services de protection de la part des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, ou pour intervenir dans les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance \u00bb (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 25, p. 2).\n[237] En 2011, le minist\u00e8re des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la jeunesse de l\u2019Ontario a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 AADNC sur la question du financement des repr\u00e9sentants des bandes :\n[traduction]\nLa Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille vise avant tout \u00e0 \u00ab promouvoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant, sa protection et son bien-\u00eatre \u00bb. Le repr\u00e9sentant de la bande, de par sa fonction, sert non seulement \u00e0 appuyer cet objectif de la Loi, mais aussi \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser les autres dispositions et objectifs importants de la Loi. Le manque de capacit\u00e9 des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations limite leur aptitude \u00e0 r\u00e9agir efficacement en respectant les d\u00e9lais d\u2019intervention pr\u00e9vus par la Loi. La suppression du financement accord\u00e9 par AINC pour permettre aux repr\u00e9sentants de bande d\u2019exercer leurs fonctions emp\u00eache les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations de jouer pleinement le r\u00f4le que la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille entendait leur confier.\n(Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 26, p. 2)\n[238] Malgr\u00e9 la discordance entre la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario et la d\u00e9cision d\u2019AADNC de ne plus financer les repr\u00e9sentants des bandes, le ministre Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab il incombe aux gouvernements des Premi\u00e8res Nations de d\u00e9terminer leur degr\u00e9 de participation aux questions relatives au bien-\u00eatre des enfants \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab nous ne pr\u00e9voyons pas que le gouvernement du Canada leur offre du financement dans ce domaine \u00bb (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 27, p. 1).\n[239] L\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e au sujet du partage des comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services en sant\u00e9 mentale aux jeunes des Premi\u00e8res Nations a \u00e9galement suscit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations. Lorsque l\u2019organisme Anishinaabe Abinooji Child and Family Services a demand\u00e9 un mandat pour offrir des services en sant\u00e9 mentale aux enfants, un employ\u00e9 d\u2019AADNC a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un document d\u2019information sur la question \u00e0 l\u2019intention du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral r\u00e9gional et des directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux adjoints r\u00e9gionaux (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 28 [Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate]). La directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019Anishinaabe Abinoojii Child and Family Services, Mme Stevens, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le contenu de ce document (Transcription, vol. 25, p. 174 \u00e0 178).\n[240] Selon le document intitul\u00e9 Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate, il y a des listes d\u2019attente pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, desservis par les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfant et \u00e0 la famille d\u2019Abinoojii, qui ont besoin de services en sant\u00e9 mentale. Le document ajoute que, bien que l\u2019on constate une certaine collaboration entre les organismes vou\u00e9s \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 mentale et l\u2019organisme Abinoojii en ce qui concerne la gestion de ces listes d\u2019attente, il faut davantage de ressources et d\u2019outils d\u2019\u00e9valuation adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, ainsi que de conseillers. Le minist\u00e8re des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la jeunesse a une politique sur la sant\u00e9 mentale des enfants et des adolescents et dispose de certaines ressources pour le counseling en sant\u00e9 mentale, mais les besoins d\u00e9passent de loin le financement (Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate, p. 1 et 2).\n[241] Le document intitul\u00e9 Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate explique, dans son examen de la demande, qu\u2019AADNC n\u2019a pas le mandat d\u2019offrir des services en sant\u00e9 mentale et, que ces d\u00e9penses ne sont pas des d\u00e9penses admissibles au sens de l\u2019Entente de 1965. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t Sant\u00e9 Canada qui est le minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral comp\u00e9tent en sant\u00e9 mentale et qui offre du financement par l\u2019entremise de divers programmes. Toutefois, ces programmes sont davantage ax\u00e9s sur la pr\u00e9vention et la plupart visent des probl\u00e8mes qui concernent les adultes. Les programmes de Sant\u00e9 Canada ne portent pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur les enfants plac\u00e9s et ils ne couvrent pas le counseling en sant\u00e9 mentale (Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate, p. 2).\n[242] Sant\u00e9 Canada a reconnu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner l\u2019ensemble du syst\u00e8me, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les services et les programmes ont tendance \u00e0 travailler en vase clos, lors d\u2019une table ronde \u00e0 laquelle participaient l\u2019organisme Anishinaabe Abinooji Child and Family Services, AADNC, Sant\u00e9 Canada et le minist\u00e8re des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la jeunesse de l\u2019Ontario. Sant\u00e9 Canada a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de red\u00e9finir les priorit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019affectation des ressources et de r\u00e9clamer un financement suppl\u00e9mentaire. AADNC a expliqu\u00e9 que la province \u00e9tait le chef de file en mati\u00e8re de protection des enfants tandis que Sant\u00e9 Canada jouait ce r\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cependant AANDC a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il appuyait les travaux relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019examen des programmes existants, la mise en lumi\u00e8re des lacunes et la collaboration pour s\u2019assurer que les Premi\u00e8res Nations re\u00e7oivent des services comparables et adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture (Abinoojii Mental Health Services Mandate, p. 2).\n[243] En 2012, l\u2019Association ontarienne des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (l\u2019AOSAE) a produit un rapport portant sur les tendances en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en Ontario, y compris au sein des collectivit\u00e9s autochtones (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 29 [Rapport des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance]). L\u2019AOSAE est une association vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats des enfants. Elle repr\u00e9sente 45 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance (SAE). Dirig\u00e9e par un conseil d\u2019administration form\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9voles, l\u2019AOSAE consulte et conseille le gouvernement provincial sur des questions de lois, de r\u00e8glements, de politiques, de normes et de m\u00e9canismes d\u2019examen. Elle cherche \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles (Rapport des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, p. 2). Compte tenu du mandat de l\u2019AOSAE et des objectifs qu\u2019elle s\u2019est fix\u00e9s, le Tribunal estime que son rapport est pertinent et fiable.\n[244] Selon le Rapport des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, le mod\u00e8le actuel de financement ne tient pas compte des besoins des collectivit\u00e9s et des organismes autochtones et ce, pour plusieurs raisons. L\u2019une des raisons est le manque de ressources pour les services, qui tendent \u00e0 ne r\u00e9pondent qu\u2019aux crises. Une autre raison est le manque de financement pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences administratives. Le rapport mentionne \u00e9galement le manque de financement pour \u00e9tablir les infrastructures n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la prestation de services de protection de l\u2019enfance pr\u00e9vus par la loi, tout en composant avec des lacunes ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nales sur le plan des infrastructures dans bon nombre des collectivit\u00e9s desservies. Il souligne \u00e9galement le manque d\u2019argent pour se doter de personnel qualifi\u00e9 pour offrir des services culturellement adapt\u00e9s (p. 7). L\u2019AOSAE a notamment demand\u00e9 ce qui suit au gouvernement de l\u2019Ontario (\u00e0 la page 10 du Rapport des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance) :\nCr\u00e9er un mod\u00e8le de financement du bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance autochtone et instaurer un financement ad\u00e9quat pour appuyer des programmes culturellement appropri\u00e9s qui tiennent compte des exp\u00e9riences propres aux diverses populations autochtones \u2013 dans les r\u00e9serves, hors r\u00e9serve ainsi que dans les r\u00e9gions \u00e9loign\u00e9es, rurales et urbaines. Investir dans le renforcement de la capacit\u00e9 afin de permettre le recrutement, la formation et le maintien appropri\u00e9s de professionnels du bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance dans les SAE autochtones \u00e9mergentes.\n[245] L\u2019Entente de 1965 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu pas de partage des d\u00e9penses en capital au titre des infrastructures et du renforcement des capacit\u00e9s depuis 1975 (t\u00e9moignage de P. Digby, Transcription, vol. 59, p. 93). Mme Stevens a expliqu\u00e9 les r\u00e9percussions que cette situation avait eues sur son organisation : bon nombre d\u2019enfants \u00e0 risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 sont envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la collectivit\u00e9 pour recevoir des services, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de centre de traitement dans leur collectivit\u00e9. L\u2019organisme Anishinaabe Abinooji Child and Family Services consacre environ deux \u00e0 trois millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e pour envoyer des enfants \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur collectivit\u00e9. Selon Mme Stevens, il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de ressources pour construire un centre de traitement, ou pour \u00e9laborer des programmes pour venir en aide \u00e0 ces enfants \u00e0 risque \u00e9lev\u00e9, parce que les fonds en question sont consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs besoins courants (Transcription, vol. 25, p. 32).\n[246] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve susmentionn\u00e9s au sujet de l\u2019Entente de 1965 r\u00e9v\u00e8lent, eux aussi, des lacunes dans l\u2019approche pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par AADNC en ce qui concerne la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations en Ontario. Le Tribunal conclut que la situation qui existe en Ontario en mati\u00e8re de prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 l\u2019objectif de l\u2019Entente de 1965 de [traduction] \u00ab [...] mettre \u00e0 la disposition des Indiens de la province, la gamme compl\u00e8te des programmes d\u2019aide sociale provinciaux \u00bb.\nd. Autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales\n[247] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, deux autres provinces ont sign\u00e9 des ententes avec AADNC pour la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans des r\u00e9serves : l\u2019Alberta et la Colombie-Britannique. Dans le cas du Yukon, il s\u2019agit de l\u2019Entente de financement du Yukon.\n[248] L\u2019Entente de financement du Yukon, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, vise l\u2019ensemble des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations r\u00e9sidant ordinairement au Yukon. L\u2019annexe \u00ab DIAND\u20113 \u00bb de l\u2019Entente de financement du Yukon pr\u00e9voit que la Directive 20\u20111 s\u2019applique au financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations en question.\n[249] En Alberta et en Colombie-Britannique, AADNC rembourse les provinces pour la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 certaines collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves non desservies par des organismes de SEFPN. En Alberta, six collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont desservies par l\u2019Entente portant r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Alberta en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. En Colombie-Britannique, soixante-douze collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations re\u00e7oivent des services en vertu de l\u2019Entente de services de la C.\u2011B.\n[250] Aux termes de l\u2019Entente portant r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Alberta, AADNC rembourse l\u2019Alberta pour divers services sociaux offerts dans certaines r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans la province, y compris des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Le financement des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en question est offert au d\u00e9but de l\u2019exercice financier, selon un mod\u00e8le de financement fond\u00e9 sur les co\u00fbts \u00e9tablis \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019exercice pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Des ajustements sont effectu\u00e9s en fonction des d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019exercice (Entente portant r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Alberta, annexe A, art. 1).\n[251] En Colombie-Britannique, le Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B. a \u00e9t\u00e9 en vigueur de 1996 \u00e0 2012. Aux termes du Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B., AADNC remboursait la province pour ses d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien admissibles selon une formule d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re qui tenait compte des frais d\u2019administration, de supervision et d\u2019entretien de la province (Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B., art. 5.0 et annexes B et D). Les taux d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re pouvaient \u00eatre ajust\u00e9s annuellement et la province pouvait obtenir un ajustement des taux d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente en fonction des d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es (Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B., annexe C). Ces ajustements tenaient compte des augmentations attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019inflation et de l\u2019importance accrue accord\u00e9e aux services de pr\u00e9vention. Pour l\u2019exercice 2006\u20112007, l\u2019ajustement des taux d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re s\u2019est traduit par l\u2019envoi \u00e0 AADNC d\u2019une facture de plus de cinq millions de dollars (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 30).\n[252] En 2012, le Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B. a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par l\u2019Entente de service de la C.\u2011B. L\u2019Entente de service de la C.\u2011B. pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9sormais le remboursement des frais d\u2019entretien en fonction des d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es. Elle pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement le financement des d\u00e9penses d\u2019exploitation de la province en fonction d\u2019un mod\u00e8le d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts convenu par la province et AADNC (Entente de service de la C.\u2011B., art. 7 et Annexe A). Pour l\u2019exercice 2012\u20112013, le financement du budget d\u2019exploitation s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 15 millions de dollars.\n[253] L\u2019Entente portant r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Alberta, le Protocole d\u2019entente de la C.\u2011B. et l\u2019Entente de service de la C.\u2011B. pr\u00e9voient le remboursement des frais d\u2019exploitation et des frais d\u2019administration admissibles effectivement engag\u00e9s. Ils pr\u00e9voient \u00e9galement des ajustements r\u00e9troactifs pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation et des augmentations attribuables aux changements apport\u00e9s aux programmes. La situation est donc fort diff\u00e9rente de celle des organismes de SEFPN dans ces provinces, notamment dans le cas de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, qui ne pr\u00e9voit aucun ajustement pour ce genre de hausse de co\u00fbts (t\u00e9moignage de C. Schimanke, Transcription, vol. 62, p. 53 et 54). Comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 19 du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, ces ajustements et remboursements pour tenir compte des d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es sont directement li\u00e9s aux lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance :\n4.49 Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada verse des fonds \u00e0 certaines provinces pour la prestation de ces services l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les Premi\u00e8res nations ne les offrent pas. Le Minist\u00e8re a sign\u00e9 des accords de financement avec trois des cinq provinces examin\u00e9es dans le cadre de cette v\u00e9rification pour la prestation des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves. Nous avons constat\u00e9 que le Minist\u00e8re remboursait \u00e0 ces provinces la totalit\u00e9 ou la part convenue des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s au fonctionnement et \u00e0 l\u2019administration des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts directement aux Premi\u00e8res nations, ainsi que des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la prise en charge d\u2019enfants [\u2026]\n4.50 Le financement qu\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada verse pour couvrir les co\u00fbts de fonctionnement et d\u2019administration des organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations est calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une formule. Or, nous avons constat\u00e9 que cette formule de financement ne tient pas compte de l\u2019exigence du Programme selon laquelle les organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations doivent se conformer \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale applicable. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment principal de la formule est le nombre d\u2019enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 0 \u00e0 18 ans qui r\u00e9sident habituellement dans la ou les r\u00e9serves servies par un organisme des Premi\u00e8res nations [\u2026]\n[254] Le Tribunal reviendra sur cette comparaison dans la section qui suit.\niii. Position d\u2019AADNC sur la preuve\n[255] AADNC soutient que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve susmentionn\u00e9s ne sont pas suffisants pour d\u00e9montrer que les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du financement, par AADNC, des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. AADNC affirme notamment qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment d\u2019exemples pr\u00e9cis pour soutenir l\u2019all\u00e9gation que les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont priv\u00e9es des services en question. En somme, AADNC soutient que peu de poids devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 aux rapports et aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant le Programme des SEFPN. Il soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019\u00e9valuation des effets pr\u00e9judiciables devrait tenir compte des choix exerc\u00e9s par les organismes de SEFPN lorsqu\u2019ils administrent leur budget, ainsi que de tout financement additionnel qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent ind\u00e9pendamment de la Directive 20\u20111 ou de l\u2019AAAP. AADNC soutient par ailleurs que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne permet pas la comparaison des syst\u00e8mes de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial\/territorial. Il ajoute que m\u00eame si cette comparaison \u00e9tait valide, aucune preuve comparative n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Nous aborderons \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacun de ces arguments.\na. La pertinence et la fiabilit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes publi\u00e9es au sujet du Programme des SEFPN\n[256] AADNC estime que les diverses \u00e9tudes du Programme des SEFPN susmentionn\u00e9es ont peu de poids. AADNC remet en question l\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes en question, en soulignant que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue par quelques organismes ne d\u00e9montre pas l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement.\n[257] Le Tribunal estime que l\u2019EPN et les rapports Wen:De constituent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tr\u00e8s pertinents et fiables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tudes du Programme des SEFPN command\u00e9es conjointement par AADNC et l\u2019APN. On y a eu recours \u00e0 une m\u00e9thodologie rigoureuse et \u00e0 une analyse approfondie de la Directive 20\u20111, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des consultations pr\u00e9alables aupr\u00e8s de divers intervenants. Le Tribunal accepte les conclusions de ces rapports. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019AADNC ait remis en question les conclusions de ces rapports avant la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Au contraire, tout donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019AADNC s\u2019est en fait fond\u00e9 sur ces rapports pour modifier le Programme des SEFPN.\n[258] Dans sa fiche d\u2019information d\u2019octobre 2006 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 10), AADNC a reconnu les r\u00e9percussions et les conclusions des rapports Wen:De ainsi que celles de l\u2019EPN. Il s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9orienter le Programme des SEFPN pour am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves :\n\u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, le financement du Programme est en grande partie ax\u00e9 sur les services de protection plut\u00f4t que les services de pr\u00e9vention, ce qui inciterait, selon certains, les organismes \u00e0 retirer les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations de leur foyer parental, au lieu d\u2019offrir les services de pr\u00e9vention qui permettraient aux enfants de continuer \u00e0 vivre en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez eux.\n\u00b7 En 2005\u20112006, les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au programme se chiffraient \u00e0 417 millions de dollars et l\u2019on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles continuent \u00e0 augmenter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 540 millions de dollars en 2010\u20112011 si le programme continue \u00e0 \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 selon le mod\u00e8le actuel ax\u00e9 sur la protection.\n\u00b7 Entre 1996\u20111997 et 2004\u20112005, le nombre d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations pris en charge a augment\u00e9 de 64,34 %.\n\u00b7 Environ 5,8 % des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves sont pris en charge \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du foyer parental.\nProbl\u00e8mes actuels : Les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en proportion indue dans le r\u00e9gime de soins. Les taux de placement dans les r\u00e9serves t\u00e9moignent de l\u2019absence de services de pr\u00e9vention qui att\u00e9nueraient les crises familiales.\nChangements dans le tableau : Les provinces et territoires ont adopt\u00e9 de nouvelles approches pour les politiques de soins aux enfants et \u00e9largi l\u2019\u00e9ventail de services et programmes que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations sont tenus d\u2019assurer pour conserver leurs mandats provinciaux en qualit\u00e9 de fournisseurs de services. Toutefois, l\u2019approche f\u00e9d\u00e9rale actuelle pour le financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille a emp\u00each\u00e9 les organismes de services dans ce domaine de suivre le rythme des changements de politiques des provinces et des territoires en la mati\u00e8re; en cons\u00e9quence, il est impossible \u00e0 ces organismes d\u2019offrir l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des services propos\u00e9s par les provinces et des territoires aux autres Canadiens. Il faut absolument changer du tout au tout l\u2019approche pour le financement des soins \u00e0 l\u2019enfance par les organismes de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations si l\u2019on veut inverser la croissance dans le taux de prise en charge des enfants et faire en sorte que les organismes s\u2019acquittent des responsabilit\u00e9s inscrites dans leurs mandats.\nL\u2019avenir : Le comit\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de l\u2019Examen mixte de la politique nationale sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en 2000, avait recommand\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u2019augmenter les services de pr\u00e9vention destin\u00e9s aux enfants \u00e0 risque \u2011 services qui sont obligatoires avant d\u2019envisager de retirer l\u2019enfant et de le placer dans un foyer d\u2019accueil \u2011 et de fournir un financement suffisant \u00e0 cette fin.\n\u00b7 En 2004 et 2005, Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada a financ\u00e9 une recherche men\u00e9e par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les rapports, WEN:DE : Nous voyons poindre la lumi\u00e8re du jour et WEN:DE : Nous poursuivons notre route, contenaient des recommandations sur les investissements et les rajustements des politiques n\u00e9cessaires pour pallier les faiblesses du syst\u00e8me actuel. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada entend se fonder sur cette recherche pour r\u00e9clamer des investissements et un renouvellement de la politique.\n[\u2026]\n\u00b7 Le gouvernement du Canada est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 collaborer avec les partenaires et organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des provinces et du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vue de mettre en \u0153uvre une vision modernis\u00e9e du Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, lequel a pour mission de veiller \u00e0 ce que les enfants et les jeunes soient forts et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et jouissent du soutien de parents sains.\n\u00b7 La strat\u00e9gie vise \u00e0 faire d\u2019un programme actuellement ax\u00e9 sur la protection un programme ax\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9vention, \u00e0 promouvoir diff\u00e9rentes modalit\u00e9s de soins pour offrir aux enfants et aux jeunes des foyers s\u00fbrs, affectueux et permanents, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 prendre appui sur les partenariats et \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des solutions pratiques en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les services d\u2019intervention aupr\u00e8s des enfants.\n[259] Mmes Murphy et D\u2019Amico ont \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du fait qu\u2019AADNC s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur les rapports Wen:De pour mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019AAAP (Transcription, vol. 53, p. 46 et 47; et vol. 54, p. 50 et 51).\n[260] Des documents internes d\u2019AADNC admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience confirment \u00e9galement que le minist\u00e8re a souscrit aux conclusions des rapports de l\u2019EPN et des rapports Wen:De. AADNC soutient que le Tribunal devrait se fier aux t\u00e9moignages oraux plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on trouve dans les documents internes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que bon nombre de leurs auteurs n\u2019ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal pour fournir un contexte. De plus, ces documents peuvent simplement refl\u00e9ter l\u2019opinion d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis. Par cons\u00e9quent, AADNC affirme que le Tribunal devrait appr\u00e9cier la valeur probante des documents en fonction du contexte et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des t\u00e9moignages oraux donn\u00e9s au sujet de leur interpr\u00e9tation. Le Tribunal devrait \u00e9galement tenir compte des limites de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qu\u2019avaient leurs auteurs lorsqu\u2019ils ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les documents en question.\n[261] Le Tribunal a tenu compte de ces arguments pour \u00e9valuer la preuve et conclut que les documents en question sont clairs et simples. Bon nombre d\u2019entre eux sont des communications pr\u00e9par\u00e9es pour des hauts fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC ou adress\u00e9es \u00e0 ces derniers. Le Tribunal conclut que ces communications sont tr\u00e8s pertinentes et fiables, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ont servi \u00e0 informer la haute direction d\u2019AANDC, notamment le sous-ministre et les sous-ministres adjoints, au sujet du Programme des SEFPN afin d\u2019\u00e9clairer leurs d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques ou leurs futures demandes au Cabinet (Transcription, vol. 54, p. 159 et 166; et vol. 55, p. 199). De plus, les autres documents d\u2019AADNC ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9s corroborent les renseignements que l\u2019on trouve dans ces communications.\n[262] Ainsi, une communication faite en 2005 au \u00ab Comit\u00e9 des politiques \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019EPN en d\u00e9clarant ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Une r\u00e9vision du Programme des SEFPN effectu\u00e9e en 2000 a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le financement accord\u00e9 par les Affaires indiennes [aux organismes de SEFPN] \u00e9tait de 22 % inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait vers\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs homologues provinciaux \u00bb (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 31, p. 2 [Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques]). \u00c0 la page 3, la Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques pr\u00e9cise que, bien que les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien augmentent de 7 \u00e0 10 % par ann\u00e9e, le budget du Minist\u00e8re ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie que d\u2019un ajustement annuel de 2 %. Selon la Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques, \u00e0 la page 3, [TRADUCTION] \u00ab des investissements suppl\u00e9mentaires sont n\u00e9cessaires pour stabiliser davantage les mesures de soutien de base, afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 organisationnelle et pr\u00e9server la croissance des d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien \u00bb.\n[263] La Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques de 2005 indique \u00e9galement que les organismes de SEFPN menacent de se retirer de la prestation des services, parce qu\u2019ils ne sont plus en mesure de fournir les services exig\u00e9s par les provinces avec leur budget actuel. Selon la Communication, les gouvernements provinciaux ont \u00e9crit au ministre d\u2019AADNC pour lui expliquer qu\u2019ils s\u2019inqui\u00e9taient du fait que le Minist\u00e8re ne leur fournissait pas un financement suffisant pour permettre aux organismes de SEFPN de respecter les obligations qui leur sont impos\u00e9es par les lois provinciales. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques pr\u00e9vient que les provinces risquent de refuser de renouveler le mandat des organismes de SEFPN ou de confier ce mandat \u00e0 de nouveaux organismes (p. 4).\n[264] En accord avec l\u2019EPN et avec les rapports Wen:De, la Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques affirme : [traduction] \u00ab Outre des mesures de soutien de base am\u00e9lior\u00e9es pour les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, il est n\u00e9cessaire de modifier radicalement la mani\u00e8re d\u2019aborder les services \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019enfance pour inverser la tendance \u00e0 la hausse du nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge \u00bb (p. 5). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Communication propose la mise en place de nouvelles mesures pour permettre l\u2019investissement dans les services de pr\u00e9vention, conform\u00e9ment aux lois et aux normes provinciales (p. 6). Ces mesures [traduction] \u00ab permettront d\u2019offrir un \u00e9ventail complet de programmes et de services culturellement adapt\u00e9s, qui diminueront \u00e9ventuellement la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le syst\u00e8me de protection de l\u2019enfance \u00bb (Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques, p. 6). Elles permettront \u00e9galement [traduction] \u00ab [...] de r\u00e9pondre imm\u00e9diatement aux \u00e9normes pressions exerc\u00e9es sur le financement et de stabiliser l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves \u00bb (Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques, p. 6). Enfin, selon la Communication devant le Comit\u00e9 des politiques [traduction] \u00ab le fait d\u2019augmenter le budget des services fondamentaux permettra [aux organismes de SEFPN] de retenir et de former du personnel, ainsi que de faire face \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation des frais d\u2019exploitation (p. ex., ajustement pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie, frais juridiques, assurance, \u00e9loignement) \u00bb (p. 6).\n[265] Dans un autre document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Questions et r\u00e9ponses concernant les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00bb, on trouve \u00e9galement ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLa situation est dramatique. L\u2019insuffisance des ressources risque de contraindre certains organismes \u00e0 fermer leurs portes si leur mandat leur est retir\u00e9 ou n\u2019est pas reconduit par les provinces. En pareil cas, les provinces se chargeraient de la protection de l\u2019enfance, ce qui entra\u00eenerait probablement des co\u00fbts beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada.\n[\u2026]\nAu cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, on a assist\u00e9, en mati\u00e8re de protection de l\u2019enfance, \u00e0 une tendance vers la pr\u00e9vention et l\u2019adoption de mesures moins perturbatrices. AINC reconna\u00eet que la formule de financement actuelle n\u2019est pas suffisamment souple pour suivre cette tendance et qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de la r\u00e9viser [\u2026] AINC a re\u00e7u pour 2004\u20112005 les autorisations n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre en \u0153uvre une entente de financement souple des d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien. Ces modalit\u00e9s permettront \u00e0 certains organismes de r\u00e9affecter une partie de leur budget d\u2019entretien, pour leur donner une plus grande marge de man\u0153uvre dans la mani\u00e8re d\u2019utiliser ces fonds pour mettre davantage l\u2019accent sur les services de pr\u00e9vention.\nL\u2019augmentation progressive du budget d\u2019exploitation aidera dans une tr\u00e8s faible mesure les organismes \u00e0 offrir des services de pr\u00e9vention additionnels. Des ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires aideront les organismes \u00e0 faire face aux pressions financi\u00e8res d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019augmentation des frais juridiques, des frais d\u2019assurance et des autres d\u00e9penses d\u2019exploitation qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajust\u00e9es depuis la mise en \u0153uvre, en 1994\u20111995, de l\u2019examen des programmes.\n(Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 32, p. 1, 2 et 5)\n[266] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le Manuel national du programme [des SEFPN] (2005) \u00e9num\u00e8re, \u00e0 la page 14, au paragraphe 2.2.3, certaines des pressions sur les co\u00fbts avec lesquelles les organismes de SEFPN doivent composer, s\u2019agissant du financement vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019exploitation :\nM\u00eame si les autorisations sont tr\u00e8s claires au sujet des services qui entrent dans le calcul du financement vers\u00e9 pour l\u2019exploitation, les Premi\u00e8res nations se sont dites pr\u00e9occup\u00e9es du fait que les lois, les normes et les pratiques ont consid\u00e9rablement chang\u00e9 depuis que la formule a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e, \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1980.

De nos jours, ils sont essentiels aux prestataires de programmes et de services sociaux.\nLa pr\u00e9vention (mesures les moins perturbatrices) : la tendance r\u00e9cente de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale et territoriale est d\u2019accorder une plus grande importance \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention. Bien que des ressources consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention aient \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 la formule de calcul actuelle, le financement offert n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas suffisant pour tenir compte des nouvelles r\u00e9alit\u00e9s.\nAssurance responsabilit\u00e9 : Comme c\u2019est le cas pour la pr\u00e9vention, le calcul inclut les assurances, mais, depuis le 11 septembre 2001, le co\u00fbt des assurances a connu une hausse dramatique.\nFrais juridiques : Les frais juridiques font d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie de l\u2019\u00e9quation, mais ils sont devenus plus importants que ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu lorsque la formule a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e. Les dossiers contest\u00e9s se multiplient et des changements apport\u00e9s dans les pratiques provinciales exigent que les dossiers soient d\u00e9sormais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des repr\u00e9sentants juridiques plut\u00f4t que par des travailleurs sociaux; tout cela a engendr\u00e9 une augmentation des frais.

Ce document qualifie les programmes sociaux d\u2019AADNC de [traduction] \u00ab programmes d\u2019une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e qui ne sont pas con\u00e7us pour \u00eatre aussi efficaces qu\u2019ils devraient l\u2019\u00eatre pour cr\u00e9er des changements sociaux positifs ou pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins fondamentaux dans certaines situations \u00bb (Explanations on Expenditures of Social Development Programs, p. 2). On y ajoute que si les programmes sociaux actuels \u00e9taient administr\u00e9s par les provinces, il s\u2019ensuivrait une hausse significative de co\u00fbts pour AADNC. Le document cite \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple la Kasohkowew Child Wellness Society de l\u2019Alberta, o\u00f9 il en co\u00fbterait 2,2 millions de dollars de plus que ce qu\u2019AADNC finance actuellement, si les services sociaux offerts actuellement dans cette r\u00e9serve \u00e9taient confi\u00e9s de nouveau \u00e0 la province de l\u2019Alberta (Explanations on Expenditures of Social Development Programs, p. 2).\n[268] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, dans une communication de 2006 portant sur les programmes sociaux offerts par AADNC dans les r\u00e9serves, y compris le Programme des SEFPN, on explique que ces programmes sont ax\u00e9s sur la prise de mesures correctives. Ils ne respectent pas toujours les normes et les taux des provinces et des territoires et ils ne sont pas uniformes d\u2019une province ou d\u2019un territoire \u00e0 l\u2019autre (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 34, p. 5 [Communication Social Programs]). En ce qui concerne plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le Programme des SEFPN, la communication explique qu\u2019 [traduction] \u00ab on a concentr\u00e9 les efforts sur la protection des enfants et sur le retrait des enfants du foyer parental, de sorte que la proportion d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s ne cesse d\u2019augmenter \u00bb (Communication Social Programs, p. 5).\n[269] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la communication Social Programs affirme que [traduction] \u00ab bon nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles inuit et des Premi\u00e8res Nations ne re\u00e7oivent pas de services raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux qui sont fournis aux autres Canadiens \u00bb (Communication Social Programs, p. 3). Par ailleurs, la communication souligne que [traduction] \u00ab les provinces et les territoires critiquent les niveaux de financement d\u2019AADNC car ils ne permettent pas aux fournisseurs de services des Premi\u00e8res Nations de respecter les normes pr\u00e9vues par les lois provinciales et territoriales \u00bb (Communication Social Programs, p. 6). Selon la communication, la prestation des programmes sociaux dans les r\u00e9serves est entrav\u00e9e par l\u2019absence de l\u00e9gislation, par l\u2019insuffisance de financement et par un partage des comp\u00e9tences entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui emp\u00eache de r\u00e9agir au moyen de programmes d\u2019intervention complets (Communication Social Programs, p. 3).\n[270] Dans une autre communication, AADNC qualifie la Directive 20\u20111 de \u00ab bris\u00e9e \u00bb :\n[traduction]\nLe syst\u00e8me actuel est BRIS\u00c9; il est fragment\u00e9 et d\u00e9cousu.\nLe syst\u00e8me actuel contribue \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des relations dysfonctionnelles, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des conflits de comp\u00e9tence (tant au palier f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qu\u2019au palier provincial), un manque de coordination, des objectifs contradictoires et une mentalit\u00e9 de cloisonnement.\n[\u2026]\nLe programme actuel est ax\u00e9 sur la protection (la prise en charge des enfants) plut\u00f4t que sur la pr\u00e9vention (l\u2019aide aux familles).\n[\u2026]\nLes mesures d\u2019intervention et de pr\u00e9vention pr\u00e9coces sont devenues une pratique courante dans les provinces et les territoires, dans bon nombre d\u2019\u00c9tats des \u00c9tats-Unis et en Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande.\nLes SEF du MAINC n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 suivre l\u2019\u00e9volution des changements provinciaux.\nL\u00e0 o\u00f9 les mesures d\u2019appui aux services de pr\u00e9vention sont une pratique courante, les r\u00e9sultats ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les statistiques concernant les enfants pris en charge et les co\u00fbts se sont stabilis\u00e9es ou ont diminu\u00e9.\n(Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 35, p. 2 et 3 [communication intitul\u00e9e Putting Children and Families First in Alberta])\n[271] La communication intitul\u00e9e Putting Children and Families First in Alberta qualifie la pr\u00e9vention d\u2019option id\u00e9ale pour r\u00e9soudre ces probl\u00e8mes, \u00e0 la page 4 :\n[traduction]\nLa pr\u00e9vention pr\u00e9coce et les solutions ax\u00e9es sur l\u2019enfant sont les pi\u00e8ces manquantes du casse-t\u00eate en ce qui concerne les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves.\nLa pr\u00e9vention pr\u00e9coce appuie les mesures permettant d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de vie des enfants et des familles, ce qui favorise de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats dans le domaine du d\u00e9veloppement, de l\u2019\u00e9ducation et de la sant\u00e9 de la petite enfance.\n[272] Enfin, la communication Putting Children and Families First in Alberta affirme ce qui suit, \u00e0 la page 5 :\n[traduction]\nLes faits sont clairs :\nLe rapport Wen:De : l\u2019intervention et la pr\u00e9vention pr\u00e9coces sont ESSENTIELLES.\n[\u2026]\nLes organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations font des pressions sur le Canada depuis 1998 pour changer le syst\u00e8me.\n[273] La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019\u00e9valuation et de la v\u00e9rification interne d\u2019AADNC a \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre \u00e9valuation du Programme des SEFPN en 2007 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 14 [\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007)]) Les conclusions et les recommandations de l\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007) reprennent celles de l\u2019EPN et des rapports Wen:De. Signalons, \u00e0 la page ii, les conclusions suivantes de l\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007) :\nBien que le programme soit parvenu \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 une demande de services de plus en plus forte, on ne peut affirmer qu\u2019il a atteint son objectif consistant \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement plus s\u00e9curitaire et plus stable pour les enfants qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019est parvenu \u00e0 suivre le rythme impos\u00e9 par la tendance, tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale qu\u2019internationale, \u00e0 accorder plus d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention.\nLe mode de financement du programme, la Directive 20\u20111, a probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019un des facteurs ayant men\u00e9 aux augmentations du nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge et des d\u00e9penses du programme, car il a eu pour effet d\u2019inciter les organismes \u00e0 choisir des solutions ax\u00e9es sur la prise en charge \u2011 le placement en famille d\u2019accueil, les foyers pour enfants et les soins en \u00e9tablissement \u2011 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que seuls les co\u00fbts de ces organismes sont int\u00e9gralement rembours\u00e9s.\n[274] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces conclusions, l\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007) a formul\u00e9 six recommandations, \u00e0 la page iii. On y recommandait notamment qu\u2019AADNC :\n1. clarifie la hi\u00e9rarchie des objectifs du Ministre en mati\u00e8re de politique en ce qui a trait au Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations afin d\u2019accorder la priorit\u00e9 au bien-\u00eatre et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des enfants;\n2. corrige la lacune du mode de financement du Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations qui favorise le placement des enfants \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du foyer alors qu\u2019il serait plus appropri\u00e9 de faire appel aux mesures les moins perturbatrices (mesures appliqu\u00e9es dans le foyer). Le bien-\u00eatre et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des enfants doivent \u00eatre les principaux facteurs dont tiennent compte les organismes dans leurs d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de placement;\n[275] L\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007) explique \u00e9galement que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape pour am\u00e9liorer le Programme des SEFPN consiste \u00e0 modifier la Directive 20\u20111, en ajoutant un nouveau m\u00e9canisme de financement pour s\u2019assurer que le programme offre un soutien ad\u00e9quat au travail de pr\u00e9vention (p. 39). Le document examine les co\u00fbts et les avantages de mettre davantage l\u2019accent sur la pr\u00e9vention et d\u00e9crit les estimations de co\u00fbts donn\u00e9es dans le rapport Wen:De no 3 notamment, 22,9 millions de dollars pour de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes de gestion de l\u2019information, les co\u00fbts en immobilisation (immeubles, v\u00e9hicules et \u00e9quipement de bureau) et les primes d\u2019assurances. Il souligne \u00e9galement l\u2019estimation de 86,4 millions de dollars pour le financement annuel de facteurs tels que les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation afin de ramener le financement au niveau o\u00f9 il se situait en 1995, l\u2019ajustement du financement des organismes \u00e9loign\u00e9s ou de petite taille et, l\u2019augmentation du montant de base pour les frais d\u2019exploitation de 143 000 \u00e0 308 751 $ par ann\u00e9e (\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007), p. 40).\n[276] Le sous-ministre Michael Wernick a qualifi\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP d\u2019 [traduction] \u00ab [...] approche qui permettra d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la situation des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 36), dans une r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e le 11 septembre 2009 \u00e0 des questions soulev\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du d\u00e9veloppement du Grand Nord. La r\u00e9ponse de M.

Et je crois que vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 abord\u00e9 la question, mais je voulais vous entendre donner un peu plus de d\u00e9tails \u00e0 ce sujet.

Autrement dit, comment on en est venu \u00e0 \u00e9laborer cette nouvelle approche?\nMme MURPHY : Nous n\u2019obtenions pas de bons r\u00e9sultats. Mme MURPHY : Nous avions des probl\u00e8mes avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations. Nous avions des probl\u00e8mes avec le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge et nous voulions diminuer ce nombre. Nous voulions que les enfants soient en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et nous voulions \u00e9viter de devoir les placer. Je veux dire, le d\u00e9fi qui se pose dans le cas des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u2013 et je suis certaine que cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e par d\u2019autres personnes \u2013 est le fait que, surtout pour les petites collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es, quand il est n\u00e9cessaire de placer des enfants, il arrive parfois que l\u2019on ne puisse pas r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l\u2019enfant au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 et donc, qu\u2019on ne puisse pas garder l\u2019enfant dans sa collectivit\u00e9. Et il ne fait aucun doute que le fait de retirer un enfant de sa famille et de sa collectivit\u00e9 entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences. Nous voulions donc trouver des solutions communautaires pour permettre aux enfants de demeurer dans leur collectivit\u00e9, de rester aupr\u00e8s de leur famille et, id\u00e9alement, pour faciliter la r\u00e9unification des familles. Nous voulions faire du travail d\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce qui nous permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter de retirer les enfants de leur foyer parental et de les \u00e9loigner de leur milieu.\n(Transcription, vol. 54, p. 49 et 50)\n[278] Toutefois, comme le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, le Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, le Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011) et le Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012) l\u2019ont soulign\u00e9, bien que l\u2019AAAP se veuille une am\u00e9lioration par rapport \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111, elle repose toujours sur des hypoth\u00e8ses probl\u00e9matiques concernant les enfants pris en charge, les familles dans le besoin et les niveaux de population pour calculer le financement. De plus, bon nombre de provinces ainsi que le Yukon sont toujours assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111 malgr\u00e9 l\u2019engagement d\u2019AADNC de les faire graduellement passer \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP.\n[279] AADNC soutient que l\u2019on ne devrait par ailleurs accorder que peu de poids au Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et au Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011) \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que leurs auteurs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 valider ces documents ou \u00e0 situer dans leur contexte les d\u00e9clarations ou les opinions qu\u2019on y trouve. De plus, AADNC soutient que ces rapports ne prouvent aucun des faits en litige.\n[280] Le Tribunal rejette les arguments d\u2019AADNC en ce qui concerne le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et le Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011). La V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas un t\u00e9moin contraignable (article 18.1 de la Loi sur le v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral). N\u00e9anmoins, le Tribunal est convaincu que le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et le Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011) sont des documents fiables, pertinents et clairs. Ils sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rendre compte de conclusions d\u2019une mani\u00e8re exhaustive, pour permettre au Parlement et \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la population canadienne de comprendre leurs recommandations. Ainsi que l\u2019\u00e9nonce le paragraphe 7(2) de la Loi sur le v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada d\u00e9pose annuellement un rapport devant la Chambre des communes et \u00ab [\u2026] signale tout sujet qui, \u00e0 son avis, est important et doit \u00eatre port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Chambre des communes \u00bb.\n[281] Le v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral exerce une charge publique ind\u00e9pendante au Canada et il sert les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019ensemble des Canadiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal n\u2019accorde gu\u00e8re de valeur aux rapports et aux conclusions du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et du Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), d\u2019autant plus que bon nombre des conclusions que l\u2019on trouve dans ces rapports portent express\u00e9ment sur le Programme des SEFPN. De plus, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, AADNC a publiquement accept\u00e9 les recommandations faites dans le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et dans le Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), ce qui renforce la fiabilit\u00e9 de ces rapports et leur pertinence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal accepte donc les conclusions du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et du Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011).\n[282] Pour les m\u00eames raisons, le Tribunal conclut que le Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics et le Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012) sont tr\u00e8s pertinents et fiables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Non seulement ces rapports concernent directement le Programme des SEFPN, mais de plus, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par des repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9lus, exer\u00e7ant des charges publiques dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de tous les Canadiens. Des hauts fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de t\u00e9moigner devant le Comit\u00e9 et, ce faisant, ont reconnu les conclusions de ces rapports. Une fois de plus, le Tribunal accepte les conclusions du Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics et du Rapport de 2012 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics.\n[283] Il ressort \u00e9galement des d\u00e9clarations faites par le sous-ministre et par la sous-ministre adjointe devant le Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics qu\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient l\u2019AAAP comme la solution pour corriger les lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111. Nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons : les documents internes d\u2019AADNC confirment les conclusions du Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, du Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, du Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011) et du Rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics (2012), en ce qui concerne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer la transition vers l\u2019AAAP des provinces et des territoires toujours assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111, tout en reconnaissant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer l\u2019AAAP.\n[284] En 2010, la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019\u00e9valuation, de la mesure du rendement et de l\u2019examen d\u2019AADNC a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre \u00e9valuation de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 37 [\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta]). Les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation ont conclu que la conception de l\u2019AAAP \u00e9tait un pas dans la bonne direction, susceptible de produire des r\u00e9sultats positifs. Ils ont toutefois relev\u00e9 quelques difficult\u00e9s concernant le mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP, notamment les d\u00e9lais, les exigences provinciales, la p\u00e9nurie de ressources humaines, les salaires, le soutien du gouvernement et de la direction des organismes, les liens avec la collectivit\u00e9, la formation et l\u2019isolement g\u00e9ographique. Les organismes de SEFPN consid\u00e9raient tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme \u00e9tant essentiels \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de la mise en oeuvre de l\u2019approche. Ils ont \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 le d\u00e9fi d\u2019assurer une collecte de renseignements pertinents, permettant une bonne mesure du rendement et une certaine comparabilit\u00e9 des services de pr\u00e9vention (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, p. vi, 11,16 et 17, 21 et 24).\n[285] En outre, les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation ont signal\u00e9 que la plupart des volets de l\u2019AAAP \u00e9taient financ\u00e9s sur une base annuelle et certains, selon une m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00ab les organismes n\u2019ont pas la latitude voulue pour s\u2019adapter rapidement \u00e0 des modifications aux politiques provinciales ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments externes [\u2026] (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, p. 27). Selon les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation, ce manque de souplesse \u00ab est assez fr\u00e9quent dans les programmes d\u2019AINC assujettis aux lois provinciales et [\u2026] fait partie des risques inh\u00e9rents \u00bb (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, p. 27).\n[286] Par ailleurs, l\u2019\u00c9valuation a identifi\u00e9 plusieurs probl\u00e8mes de comp\u00e9tence susceptibles de compromettre l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la prestation de services, notamment la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de soutien aux fins de la pr\u00e9vention et l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ceux-ci. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation ont soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019un d\u00e9fi de la mise en \u0153uvre commun aux organismes de prestation des SEFPN \u00e9tait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir des services sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelon communautaire (p. ex. \u00e9valuation de l\u2019ensemble des troubles caus\u00e9s par l\u2019alcoolisation f\u0153tale, assistance m\u00e9dicale, th\u00e9rapie, counseling, aide aux toxicomanes). Les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation ont \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance primordiale de la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de soutien, aux fins de la pr\u00e9vention et de leur acc\u00e8s. \u00c0 leur avis, le financement accord\u00e9 par AADCN ne permet pas de ces services, quoiqu\u2019ils soient offerts par d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res et programmes dans les r\u00e9serves et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celles-ci (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, p. 16\u201118, 21\u201124).\n[287] Les auteurs de l\u2019\u00c9valuation ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 AINC de revoir la m\u00e9thode de financement de l\u2019AAAP au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante afin de tirer parti des deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de mise en application. Ils lui ont \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter des ressources pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certains probl\u00e8mes avec lesquels les collectivit\u00e9s rurales ou isol\u00e9es sont aux prises. Dans le cadre de cet examen, l\u2019\u00c9valuation a recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 AADNC de d\u00e9cider si les calculs fond\u00e9s sur le nombre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s \u00e9taient pertinents pour atteindre les r\u00e9sultats souhait\u00e9s (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, p. i).\n[288] En 2012, la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019\u00e9valuation, de la mesure du rendement et de l\u2019examen d\u2019AADNC a \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre \u00e9valuation de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 38 [Evaluation of the Enhanced Focused Approach in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia for the First Nations Child and Family Services Program]; voir \u00e9galement Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 39). L\u00e0 encore, les conclusions de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concordent avec celles des autres rapports publi\u00e9s sur le Programme des SEFPN.\n[289] L\u2019\u00c9valuation de 2012 a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair si l\u2019AAAP \u00e9tait suffisamment souple pour tenir compte des changements apport\u00e9s au financement provincial (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, p. 55). Elle a not\u00e9 que le bureau r\u00e9gional de la Saskatchewan et celui de l\u2019Atlantique peinaient tous deux \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter de leurs t\u00e2ches en raison de contraintes li\u00e9es aux effectifs, y compris des ratios de cas sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la norme provinciale et la difficult\u00e9 de recruter et de maintenir en poste des employ\u00e9s qualifi\u00e9s, particuli\u00e8rement du personnel des Premi\u00e8res Nations (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, p. 55). Les auteurs ont soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de d\u00e9penses d\u2019immobilisations pour de nouveaux b\u00e2timents, de nouveaux v\u00e9hicules et du mat\u00e9riel informatique, pour assurer la conformit\u00e9 aux normes provinciales, ainsi que pour am\u00e9liorer le climat de travail au sein des organismes de SEFPN. Toutefois, ces d\u00e9penses n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues au moment de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019AAAP et l\u2019\u00c9valuation de 2012 a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient souvent financ\u00e9es \u00e0 m\u00eame les budgets de pr\u00e9vention (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, p. 53).\n[290] Une des principales difficult\u00e9s dans la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse portait sur le caract\u00e8re irr\u00e9aliste des attentes, principalement de la part des dirigeants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, quant \u00e0 ce que les organismes de SEFPN peuvent r\u00e9aliser, compte tenu du financement qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent. Selon l\u2019\u00c9valuation, les dirigeants s\u2019attendent occasionnellement \u00e0 ce que les organismes assument des co\u00fbts qui sont de nature sociale, mais qui ne font pas partie des d\u00e9penses admissibles des organismes. Autrement dit, les conditions qui contribuent le plus \u00e0 mettre un enfant \u00e0 risque sont des conditions auxquelles le syst\u00e8me de protection de l\u2019enfance lui\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019a souvent pas le mandat, ou la capacit\u00e9, de r\u00e9pondre directement, comme le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, la promotion de la sant\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9ducation et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 culturelle (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, p. 39, 54, et 55). L\u2019\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse indique, \u00e0 la page 54 : \u00ab Pour plus d\u2019efficience, AADNC pourrait avoir une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de ses programmes et des autres programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et en faciliter la coordination \u00bb.\n[291] Les difficult\u00e9s caus\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9loignement ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es comme un des principaux d\u00e9fis qui se posaient en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse. Le tiers des organismes ont signal\u00e9 le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 des d\u00e9placements et le temps qu\u2019il faut y consacrer, de m\u00eame que le risque de ne pas pouvoir intervenir \u00e0 temps dans les cas critiques. En Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, qui ne compte qu\u2019un seul organisme de SEFPN dot\u00e9 de deux bureaux sur tout le territoire de la province, un intervenant peut prendre deux \u00e0 trois heures pour rejoindre un enfant dans le sud\u2011ouest de la province. En revanche, le mod\u00e8le provincial est structur\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on telle que ses agences peuvent rejoindre tout enfant en \u00e9tat de besoin en une demi\u2011heure au maximum. Dans les pires des cas, les organismes de SEFPN de la Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse ont d\u00fb se tourner vers les agences provinciales pour obtenir de l\u2019aide. Selon l\u2019\u00c9valuation, ces probl\u00e8mes ont incit\u00e9 la province \u00e0 recommander \u00e0 AADNC d\u2019appuyer financi\u00e8rement l\u2019ouverture d\u2019un troisi\u00e8me bureau dans le sud\u2011ouest de la province. (\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, p. 39).\n[292] Dans une communication d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2012 intitul\u00e9e \u00ab First Nations Child and Family Services Program (FNCFS) The Way Forward \u00bb, Mme Odette Johnson, directrice de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille d\u2019AADNC, exposait \u00e0 Mme Fran\u00e7oise Ducros, sous-ministre adjointe, SPPEDS, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9\u00e9valuation de l\u2019AAAP (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 40 [Communication The Way Forward]). Cette communication visait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab proposer des solutions et chercher \u00e0 obtenir les approbations n\u00e9cessaires pour franchir les \u00e9tapes suivantes de la r\u00e9forme du Programme des SEFPN \u00bb (Communication The Way Forward, p. 2). On y \u00e9num\u00e9rait les facteurs ayant motiv\u00e9 cette r\u00e9forme comme \u00e9tant les suivants : le passage, dans les provinces et les territoires, vers une approche ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention; le nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations pris en charge et les co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s de cette prise en charge; les v\u00e9rifications et \u00e9valuations internes du programme des SEFPN effectu\u00e9es par AADNC (ainsi que celles du v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), les rapports de comit\u00e9s parlementaires, les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, les rapports de d\u00e9fenseurs des droits des enfants, ainsi que d\u2019autres recherches (Communication The Way Forward, p. 5).\n[293] Selon la communication The Way Forward, [traduction] \u00ab les v\u00e9rifications et les \u00e9valuations effectu\u00e9es entre 2008 et 2012 ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019AAAP, mais \u00e9galement le besoin de r\u00e9viser chaque ann\u00e9e la formule de l\u2019AAAP, car les modifications constamment apport\u00e9es par les provinces font en sorte qu\u2019il est difficile de rester \u00e0 jour et que les organismes ont du mal \u00e0 offrir une gamme compl\u00e8te de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00bb (p. 9). De plus, [traduction] \u00ab les provinces axent d\u00e9sormais davantage le traitement des dossiers sur l\u2019accueil et les enqu\u00eates, ce qui n\u2019avait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine lors de l\u2019\u00e9laboration de l\u2019AAAP et elles exercent maintenant des pressions sur les organismes \u00bb (Communication The Way Forward, p. 9).\n[294] \u00c0 la page 13, la communication The Way Forward pr\u00e9sente un tableau comparatif de la \u00ab situation actuelle \u00bb et de la \u00ab direction \u00e0 prendre \u00bb :\n[traduction]\nSituation actuelle\nDirection \u00e0 prendre\nPrise en charge des enfants et un peu de travail avec les familles en milieu familial.\n\u2192\nPrise en charge des enfants dans les cas critiques mais davantage de travail avec les familles en milieu familial.\nFinancement des organismes et des provinces pour qu\u2019ils offrent des services de protection de base et certains services de pr\u00e9vention aux familles en milieu familial.\n\u2192\nSoit le financement de toute la gamme des services offerts par les provinces (variant selon les provinces) OU transfert aux gouvernements provinciaux\/territoriaux des services d\u2019aide aux enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves.\nFinancement de l\u2019AAAP dans six provinces au d\u00e9part, mais ne portant pas n\u00e9cessairement sur tous les aspects de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance.\n\u2192\nAAAP dans toutes les provinces et tous les territoires enti\u00e8rement financ\u00e9e \u00e0 hauteur de 108,13 M$, couvrant tous les aspects de l\u2019aide \u00e0 de l\u2019enfance, y compris l\u2019accueil, l\u2019intervention pr\u00e9coce et permettant une phase de d\u00e9veloppement.\nD\u00e9veloppement de certains moyens de pr\u00e9vention dans les collectivit\u00e9s.\n\u2192\nToutes les collectivit\u00e9s ont des moyens en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9vention.\n[295] La communication propose trois solutions pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes : (1) adopter l\u2019AAAP dans les autres provinces et territoires; (2) \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019AAAP en augmentant les sommes allou\u00e9es pour tenir compte des facteurs de co\u00fbt, notamment l\u2019adoption du mod\u00e8le dans les autres provinces et territoires; (3) transf\u00e9rer le programme aux provinces et aux territoires.\n[296] Selon l\u2019option 1, les co\u00fbts de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019AAAP dans les autres provinces et territoires sont estim\u00e9s \u00e0 : 21 millions de dollars pour la Colombie-Britannique; 2 millions pour le Yukon; 5 millions pour l\u2019Ontario; 2 millions au Nouveau-Brunswick, ainsi que 2 millions pour Terre\u2011Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador. (Communication The Way Forward, p. 15). On pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement 4 millions de dollars de plus pour [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019entretien \u00bb qui, selon ce que Mme Murphy a expliqu\u00e9, est une injection de fonds additionnels pour \u00e9viter de devoir r\u00e9affecter de l\u2019argent d\u2019autres budgets d\u2019AADNC pour couvrir des frais additionnels d\u00e9bordant le cadre de la formule de financement standard (Transcription, vol. 54, p. 167 et 168). De plus, des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires de 2 millions de dollars sont pr\u00e9vus pour \u00ab la solidit\u00e9 et la transparence \u00bb afin de permettre \u00e0 AADNC de mieux g\u00e9rer le Programme des SEFPN au niveau interne (t\u00e9moignage de Mme Murphy, Transcription, vol. 54, p. 168).\n[297] La communication note, au nombre des avantages que comporte cette option, la reconnaissance du fait que le Programme des SEFPN ne peut r\u00e9gler toutes les causes de la surrepr\u00e9sentation des enfants pris en charge. Au nombre des inconv\u00e9nients, la communication souligne que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019enveloppe de financement de cinq ans de l\u2019AAAP ne r\u00e9pond pas n\u00e9cessairement aux facteurs de co\u00fbt provinciaux ni aux pressions sur le financement li\u00e9es aux probl\u00e8mes d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle des organismes \u00bb (Communication The Way Forward, p. 15). Selon Mme Murphy, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait approuv\u00e9 la communication, les principaux facteurs de co\u00fbt sont l\u2019augmentation des frais d\u2019entretien des enfants pris en charge, la croissance du nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge et les augmentations de salaire (Transcription, vol. 54, p. 158\u2011159, 179 et 181). Elle a donn\u00e9 les pr\u00e9cisions suivantes au sujet des inconv\u00e9nients de l\u2019option 1 :\n[traduction]\nAvec cette option, on parlait de frais d\u2019entretien, mais on ne tenait pas n\u00e9cessairement compte de tous les facteurs de co\u00fbt que nous avions observ\u00e9s.\nAinsi, par exemple, nous savons que le co\u00fbt des placements en famille d\u2019accueil est \u00e0 la hausse, donc les organismes tentent de payer ces factures mais nous n\u2019en avons pas tenu suffisamment compte dans notre mod\u00e8le.\nCette option ne visait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrer la situation des provinces qui appliquaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019AAAP pour tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9volution des co\u00fbts d\u00e9j\u00e0 survenue depuis la mise en place des mod\u00e8les de financement. Elle visait les cinq [qui ne l\u2019appliquaient pas encore]. Il s\u2019agissait donc en quelque sort de l\u2019option minimale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n(Transcription, vol. 54, p. 169)\n[298] Dans le cas de l\u2019option 2, le co\u00fbt de a mise en \u0153uvre de la formule \u00e9largie de l\u2019AAAP dans les autres provinces et territoires est estim\u00e9 \u00e0 65,03 millions de dollars. De plus, les fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 injecter dans les provinces ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP sont estim\u00e9s \u00e0 43,10 millions, pour un total de 108,13 millions de dollars. Outre ces montants, il faudra appliquer une clause d\u2019indexation de 3 % par ann\u00e9e, selon la communication. Les avantages que comporte cette option sont, d\u2019une part, le fait qu\u2019elle permet aux organismes de s\u2019ajuster aux normes et aux taux salariaux provinciaux, tout en conservant un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 de programmes de pr\u00e9vention et, d\u2019autre part, le fait que le financement demeure raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 celui des provinces et des territoires. Au chapitre des inconv\u00e9nients, la communication explique que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019option 2 est plus co\u00fbteuse que la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP sans \u00e9largissement de sa port\u00e9e.\u00bb (Communication The Way Forward, p. 16). Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy si les avantages de cette option donnaient \u00e0 penser qu\u2019AADNC n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019offrir un niveau comparable de services dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN. Mme Murphy a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nNous avons toujours voulu fournir des services raisonnablement comparables.\nNous avions constat\u00e9 une tendance \u00e0 la hausse en ce qui concerne le nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge et nous avions de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 maintenir les niveaux actuels compte tenu de notre budget. Bien s\u00fbr, le Minist\u00e8re proc\u00e8de \u00e0 des r\u00e9affectations, mais nous n\u2019\u00e9tions - il est certain que nous avions remarqu\u00e9 des changements et que nous devions nous adapter \u00e0 ces changements mais que nous n\u2019avons pas n\u00e9cessairement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 le faire dans tous les cas.\n(Transcription, vol. 54, p. 163 et 164)\n[299] Enfin, la troisi\u00e8me option consistant \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer aux provinces et aux territoires les services d\u2019aide aux enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une estimation de co\u00fbts, mais on indique dans la communication qu\u2019 traduction] \u00ab on risque d\u2019assister \u00e0 une hausse consid\u00e9rable des co\u00fbts \u00bb (Communication The Way Forward, p. 17). Ainsi que Mme Murphy l\u2019explique :\n[traduction]\nIl est certain que si l\u2019on demande \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre de prendre en charge la prestation d\u2019un programme, on peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait sa propre structure de co\u00fbts administratifs et qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 obtenir des fonds pour compenser ce qu\u2019il lui en co\u00fbte pour assumer ce r\u00f4le.\n[\u2026]\nCela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il le fera. Nous n\u2019avons pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9tabli ces co\u00fbts, mais nous voulions \u00e0 tout le moins souligner que les co\u00fbts risquaient d\u2019augmenter parce que nous aurions peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 absorber par exemple des frais administratifs plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s qui ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9vus maintenant dans notre mod\u00e8le de financement des organismes.\nEt il y peut y voir d\u2019autres co\u00fbts que nous ignorons. Ils voudront peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9gocier d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans le contexte de la prise en charge de cette responsabilit\u00e9 et nous ne voudrions pas attendre aux n\u00e9gociations pour le savoir.\n(Transcription, vol. 54, p. 166 et 167).\n[300] Parmi les avantages de l\u2019option 3, la question de la comparabilit\u00e9 serait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e et on pourrait mieux surveiller et assurer la conformit\u00e9 des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves. Outre les risques de hausse consid\u00e9rable des co\u00fbts, la communication \u00e9num\u00e8re, au nombre des inconv\u00e9nients de cette option, l\u2019incertitude du soutien offert \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des Premi\u00e8res Nations. D\u2019autre part, cette option implique des programmes compl\u00e9mentaires, de sorte qu\u2019elle serait difficile \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre et que les r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res ne se limiteraient pas \u00e0 AADNC (Communication The Way Forward, p. 17).\n[301] A la suite de la communication The Way Forward, Mme Murphy a, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de deux communications semblables donn\u00e9es en octobre et en novembre 2012, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 davantage les options qui s\u2019offraient pour r\u00e9former le Programme des SEFPN (t\u00e9moignage de Mme Murphy, Transcription vol. 55, p. 199). Dans ces communications, Mme Murphy a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019AADNC compl\u00e8te la transition du Programme des SEFPN vers l\u2019AAAP dans les autres provinces et territoires (\u00e0 un co\u00fbt estimatif de 139,7 millions de dollars sur cinq ans et de 36,6 millions de dollars par la suite). Elle a \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019on stabilise les pressions exerc\u00e9es sur les provinces ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP (\u00e0 un co\u00fbt estim\u00e9 \u00e0 164,1 millions de dollars sur 5 ans). Elle a propos\u00e9 que l\u2019on ajoute une clause d\u2019indexation de 3 % par ann\u00e9e pour toutes les provinces et territoires pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 (\u00e0 un co\u00fbt estimatif de 105,5 millions de dollars sur cinq ans et de 23,9 millions de dollars par la suite). De plus, elle a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019on r\u00e9clame des ressources additionnelles, pour am\u00e9liorer la gestion de programme et la reddition de comptes, (\u00e0 un co\u00fbt estimatif de 11,2 millions de dollars sur cinq ans et de 2,3 millions de dollars par la suite) (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 41, p. 2 [Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (31 octobre 2012)]; et Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 42, p. 2, 5 [Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (2 novembre 2012)]).\n[302] Voici comment elle justifie cette demande d\u2019augmentation du financement :\n[traduction]\nLa hausse des frais d\u2019entretien des enfants pris en charge d\u00e9passe de loin l\u2019augmentation de 2 % qu\u2019AADNC re\u00e7oit chaque ann\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Minist\u00e8re doit r\u00e9affecter des fonds d\u2019autres programmes pour combler le d\u00e9ficit.\nAADNC doit assumer les co\u00fbts de la prise en charge de ces enfants et ces co\u00fbts continuent \u00e0 augmenter en fl\u00e8che. Comme les frais d\u2019entretien sont essentiellement \u00e9tablis par les provinces, AADNC n\u2019a d\u2019autre choix que de prendre \u00e0 sa charge les co\u00fbts des enfants plac\u00e9s en fonction des frais fix\u00e9s par les provinces.\nDe plus, aucune clause d\u2019indexation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e pour les mod\u00e8les de financement utilis\u00e9s par le Programme des SEFPN pour aider \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts avec le temps et pour s\u2019assurer que les sommes consacr\u00e9es aux services de pr\u00e9vention concordent avec l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves.\n[\u2026]\n\u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, AADNC dispose de tr\u00e8s peu de ressources humaines qui sont d\u00e9di\u00e9es au Programme des SEFPN.\nAucun financement n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu pour am\u00e9liorer la reddition de comptes lorsque l\u2019AAAP a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e en 2007.\nLes activit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC ont augment\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019AAAP dans les six provinces.\nLa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019AADNC de g\u00e9rer et de contr\u00f4ler efficacement le programme tout en cr\u00e9ant des partenariats tripartites pour la pleine mise en \u0153uvre l\u2019AAAP est pr\u00e9sentement limit\u00e9e.\n(Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (31 octobre 2012), p. 5 et 6)\n[303] Selon Mme Murphy, bien que l\u2019on ait constat\u00e9 que l\u2019AAAP a permis d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9sultats positifs, [traduction] \u00ab le programme perd du terrain en raison de l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts provinciaux \u00bb (Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (2 novembre 2012), p. 3). Mme Murphy estime par ailleurs que sa proposition r\u00e9pond [traduction] \u00ab [...] \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts d\u2019entretien dans toutes les provinces et tous les territoires. Elle permet au programme de tenir compte des fluctuations des frais provinciaux, assurant ainsi la comparabilit\u00e9. Elle permettra \u00e9galement aux organismes de consacrer les ressources appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention, ce qui devrait entra\u00eener une diminution du nombre de placements de longue dur\u00e9e \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme \u00bb (Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (2 novembre 2012), p. 6). Les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019absence de nouveaux investissements dans le Programme des SEFPN [traduction] \u00ab ne contribueront pas \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb, selon Mme Murphy et [traduction] \u00ab [l]e gouvernement du Canada ne sera pas en mesure d\u2019assurer la comparabilit\u00e9 provinciale raisonnable des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u00bb (Communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (2 novembre 2012), p. 8). \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Murphy a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper sa pens\u00e9e sur ce dernier point :\n[traduction]\nMembre B\u00c9LANGER : \u00ab Le gouvernement du Canada ne sera pas en mesure d\u2019assurer une comparabilit\u00e9 provinciale raisonnable des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. \u00bb Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019on compare ici?\nMme MURPHY : Je crois que ce que nous voulons dire ici est que commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 couvrir les salaires et les co\u00fbts n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019occuper des enfants pris en charge, ces autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments que je vous ai expos\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous pouvons avoir difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 payer ces factures.\nNous r\u00e9ussissons \u00e0 payer ces factures pour le moment, mais si les choses continuent \u00e0 ce rythme, nous allons frapper un mur. Nous n\u2019aurons plus la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 r\u00e9affecter des fonds et nous risquons de compromettre le principe de la comparabilit\u00e9.\n(Transcription, vol. 55, p. 216)\n[304] Pour des raisons qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9es plus en d\u00e9tail \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les options et les recommandations susmentionn\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenues dans les budgets 2013 et 2014 d\u2019AADNC (Transcription, vol. 55, p. 206, 208 et 221; voir \u00e9galement Transcription, vol. 61, p. 159 \u00e0 162).\n[305] Dans l\u2019ensemble, en ce qui concerne la pertinence et de la fiabilit\u00e9 des rapports portant sur le Programme des SEFPN, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019entre 2000 et 2012, de nombreuses sources fiables ont constat\u00e9 les effets n\u00e9fastes des mod\u00e8les et de la structure de financement du Programme des SEFPN. AADNC a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de l\u2019EPN et des rapports Wen:De. Il a reconnu et accept\u00e9 les conclusions et les recommandations contenues dans les rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, notamment celles concernant l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un plan d\u2019action pour donner suite \u00e0 ces recommandations. Comme les \u00e9valuations internes et d\u2019autres documents pertinents et fiables d\u2019AADNC le d\u00e9montrent, ces \u00e9tudes et ces rapports ont servi de base \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de la Directive 20\u20111, \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de l\u2019AAAP et par la suite, \u00e0 la formulation de recommandations pour am\u00e9liorer l\u2019AAAP. Ce n\u2019est que maintenant, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, qu\u2019AADNC exprime des r\u00e9serves au sujet de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la valeur probante des rapports susmentionn\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s au sujet du Programme des SEFPN. En outre, les documents internes dont nous avons discut\u00e9 appuient ces rapports et sont des \u00e9valuations, recommandations et communications \u00e9manant de hauts fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC lui-m\u00eame. Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal n\u2019accepte pas l\u2019argument d\u2019AADNC selon lequel les rapports publi\u00e9s au sujet du Programme des SEFPN ont peu ou pas de valeur. Le Tribunal accepte les conclusions contenues dans ces rapports ainsi que les renseignements qui les corroborent et que l\u2019on trouve dans les documents susmentionn\u00e9s.\nb. Le choix des organismes de SEFPN et le financement additionnel fourni\n[306] AADNC soutient que la diff\u00e9rence entre le niveau de services et les programmes offerts dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serve a probablement peu \u00e0 voir avec le financement. Elle d\u00e9coule davantage des choix exerc\u00e9s par les organismes de SEFPN quant au type de services ou de programmes qu\u2019ils veulent fournir et d\u2019autres questions administratives ayant des incidences sur le budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Par exemple, certains organismes d\u00e9cident d\u2019affecter des fonds au salaire des membres de leur conseil d\u2019administration, alors que le budget devrait \u00eatre consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 des services de premi\u00e8re ligne. De plus, AADNC souligne que certains organismes g\u00e8rent bien leur budget et d\u00e9clarent m\u00eame des surplus. AADNC soutient qu\u2019il fournit du financement suppl\u00e9mentaire, ou qu\u2019il r\u00e9affecte des fonds lorsque des organismes de SEFPN ont besoin de fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, AADNC soutient que, s\u2019il y a insuffisance de financement, il la comble par des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[307] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, la Directive 20\u20111 et l\u2019AAAP reposent sur des mod\u00e8les de financement qui int\u00e8grent certaines hypoth\u00e8ses. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elles partent du principe que la population infantile qu\u2019elles desservent se compose de 1 000 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 0 \u00e0 18 ans, que 6 % du total des enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves font l\u2019objet d\u2019un placement et que 20 % des familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves ont besoin de services. Mme D\u2019Amico a expliqu\u00e9 que le recours \u00e0 de telles hypoth\u00e8ses garantit une certaine stabilit\u00e9 aux organismes de SEFPN. Autrement dit, m\u00eame si moins de 6 % des enfants plac\u00e9s et moins de 20 % des familles ont besoin de services, le budget de l\u2019organisme n\u2019est pas r\u00e9duit pour autant. En fait, si ces hypoth\u00e8ses refl\u00e8tent avec exactitude la situation de leur client\u00e8le, les organismes peuvent en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier et m\u00eame obtenir un financement exc\u00e9dentaire. Toutefois, sur ce dernier point, le Tribunal signale que le rapport Wen:De no 2 affirme ce qui suit : \u00ab Sans surprise, seules des agences de la C.\u2011B. ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir des surplus et dans presque tous les cas, ces surplus provenaient des per diem pour l\u2019entretien \u00bb (p. 230). Mais ce qui est plus important, c\u2019est que lorsque les hypoth\u00e8ses ne refl\u00e8tent pas fid\u00e8lement la situation de la client\u00e8le de l\u2019organisme de SEFPN \u2013 lorsque par exemple le pourcentage des enfants pris en charge et celui des familles ayant besoin de services est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 respectivement que 6 % et 20 % \u2013 la formule de financement se traduit in\u00e9vitablement par un financement insuffisant.\n[308] En 2006, 18 organismes de SEFPN comptaient plus de 10% d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur milieu familial (Communication Social Programs, p. 13). La m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, 257 collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves n\u2019avaient aucun acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et, un nombre encore plus grand de collectivit\u00e9s n\u2019avaient pas suffisamment de ressources pour subvenir aux besoins de 20 % des enfants de la naissance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de six ans (Communication Social Programs, p. 14).\n[309] Dans le cas de l\u2019Alberta, Mme Schimanke a expliqu\u00e9 que la plupart des organismes de SEFPN comptaient environ 6 % d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s, mais que certains pouvaient en compter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 11 % et m\u00eame 14 % (Transcription, vol. 61, p. 113 \u00e0 115). De plus, comme le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada l\u2019a signal\u00e9, dans les cinq provinces vis\u00e9es par le rapport, le pourcentage d\u2019enfants pris en charge variait de 0 \u00e0 28 %.\n[310] Au Manitoba, Mme Elsie Flette, pr\u00e9sidente directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la R\u00e9gie des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Sud du Manitoba (maintenant \u00e0 la retraite) a expliqu\u00e9 comme suit les cons\u00e9quences des hypoth\u00e8ses sur les organismes de SEFPN :\n[traduction]\nSi vous \u00eates un organisme qui a, par exemple, 5 % de sa population d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s, cette hypoth\u00e8se vous avantage, parce qu\u2019AADNC vous paie comme si 7 % de vos enfants \u00e9taient plac\u00e9s. Vous obtenez donc plus d\u2019argent sans avoir le nombre de cas correspondant. Vous n\u2019avez pas le nombre d\u2019enfants en famille d\u2019accueil correspondant \u00e0 l\u2019argent dont vous disposez, de sorte que vous disposez d\u2019une certaine marge de man\u0153uvre pour utiliser cet argent autrement.\nMais si vous \u00eates un organisme dont plus de 7 % des enfants sont plac\u00e9s, vous avez un probl\u00e8me. Et, dans le cas de notre R\u00e9gie du Sud, je crois que nous avons maintenant quatre organismes qui ont un pourcentage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que ce que pr\u00e9voit cette hypoth\u00e8se. Et je songe en particulier \u00e0 l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles o\u00f9 14 % des enfants sont plac\u00e9s, de sorte que, pour exactement la moiti\u00e9 des enfants pris en charge, cet organisme ne re\u00e7oit pas d\u2019argent.\nEn ce qui concerne les familles et les services de pr\u00e9vention, j\u2019estime qu\u2019environ cinq organismes d\u00e9passent le seuil des 20 %. Le m\u00eame organisme qui compte 14 % d\u2019enfants pris en charge compte 40 % de familles qui sont dans le besoin, de sorte que 40 % des familles vivant dans la r\u00e9serve re\u00e7oivent des services.\nOr, cet organisme est financ\u00e9 \u00e0 hauteur de 20 %. Donc, la moiti\u00e9 des cas concernant les familles et les enfants ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019aucun financement, d\u2019aucun argent. Donc, m\u00eame s\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent de l\u2019argent pour la pr\u00e9vention, ils ne peuvent pas en faire parce que tout l\u2019agent doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour [...] Il faut s\u2019occuper des enfants, ils ont besoin de travailleurs, ils doivent s\u2019occuper de cette population, de ces cas et il est impossible suivant le mod\u00e8le de financement lui-m\u00eame, il est impossible de s\u2019ajuster.\n[\u2026]\nCe n\u2019est donc pas \u2013 c\u2019est un pourcentage moyen exact, mais pour certains organismes, ce pourcentage est souvent inexact, il est parfois inf\u00e9rieur et parfois sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 7 %, et vous devez alors vous occuper de cas pour lesquels vous n\u2019\u00eates pas financ\u00e9s.\n(Transcription, vol. 20, p. 104, 105 et 118)\n[311] Bien que des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires aient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis ou r\u00e9affect\u00e9s pour couvrir les frais d\u2019entretien ou pour r\u00e9gler certaines situations exceptionnelles, les organismes de SEFPN sont cens\u00e9s couvrir leurs frais d\u2019exploitation et de pr\u00e9vention \u00e0 m\u00eame leurs budgets, en utilisant notamment ces fonds pour combler tout d\u00e9ficit dans les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien. Les budgets en question sont \u00e9tablis d\u2019apr\u00e8s des mod\u00e8les qui, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, ne tiennent pas compte des besoins r\u00e9els des organismes de SEFPN. Ce sont des mod\u00e8les fig\u00e9s. Autrement dit, au fil du temps, les mod\u00e8les deviennent de plus en plus d\u00e9connect\u00e9s des besoins r\u00e9els des organismes de SEFPN et des enfants et des familles qu\u2019ils desservent. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils ne comportent pas de clauses d\u2019indexation pour tenir compte des augmentations constantes des co\u00fbts et notamment du co\u00fbt des salaires qui drainent la plus grande partie du financement. Bien que la Directive 20\u20111 pr\u00e9voie une augmentation annuelle de 2 % pour tenir compte de l\u2019augmentation du co\u00fbt de la vie, cette augmentation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e depuis 1995\u20111996. Par ailleurs, une fois que l\u2019AAAP est adopt\u00e9e dans une province ou un territoire, si l\u2019on fait abstraction des ajustements effectu\u00e9s pour tenir compte de la taille de la population, le mod\u00e8le de financement ne tient pas compte des augmentations annuelles des frais. En Alberta, par exemple, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le financement pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019AAAP est calcul\u00e9 en fonction des chiffres provinciaux de 2006. Selon un fonctionnaire d\u2019AADNC, il incombe aux organismes de SEFPN de composer avec le budget qui leur est attribu\u00e9.\n[traduction]\nM. POULIN : Donc, dans le cas d\u2019un organisme dont plus de 6 % des enfants sont pris en charge, on a besoin d\u2019un plus grand nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s pour les services de protection et ce volet sera enti\u00e8rement utilis\u00e9, ce budget d\u2019exploitation sera englouti par ce qui est essentiel pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins imm\u00e9diats, de sorte qu\u2019il en restera tr\u00e8s peu pour des services brefs.\nMme SCHIMANKE : C\u2019est possible. Tout d\u00e9pend de la fa\u00e7on dont le budget est organis\u00e9 et de la fa\u00e7on dont la grille salariale est structur\u00e9e. Encore une fois, ce sont les organismes qui d\u00e9cident, qui g\u00e8rent le tout.\nM. POULIN : Autrement dit, vos travailleurs sont moins bien pay\u00e9s en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que si c\u2019\u00e9tait la province qui les payait?\nMme SCHIMANKE : C\u2019est possible, en effet. Cela pourrait \u00eatre un exemple, oui.\nM. POULIN : Il se pourrait que vous ayez moins de travailleurs et que le ratio du nombre de cas trait\u00e9s soit plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de la province?\nMme SCHIMANKE : C\u2019est une possibilit\u00e9.\nJe dois cependant vous dire qu\u2019il y a des organismes qui ont plus de 6 % d\u2019enfants en famille d\u2019accueil et qui affichent quand m\u00eame des surplus et que je ne sais pas ce qu\u2019ils font de diff\u00e9rent. Peut-\u00eatre ajustent-ils les salaires tr\u00e8s bas; nous ne savons pas comment ils s\u2019y prennent pour obtenir de tels r\u00e9sultats. Peut-\u00eatre ont-ils une p\u00e9nurie de personnel ou leur personnel traite un plus grand nombre de cas, voil\u00e0. Il y a donc plusieurs exemples de ce que divers organismes font.\n(Transcription, vol. 62, p. 51 et 52)\n[312] Ces derni\u00e8res d\u00e9clarations font ressortir la dichotomie qui existe entre l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par le Programme des SEFPN et sa mise en \u0153uvre effective au moyen de la Directive 20\u20111 et de l\u2019AAAP. Bien que le programme soit fond\u00e9 sur le principe de la comparabilit\u00e9 provinciale, les m\u00e9canismes de financement ne permettent pas \u00e0 bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN, en particulier ceux dont les pourcentages d\u2019enfants pris en charge et de familles dans le besoin ne correspondent pas aux hypoth\u00e8ses d\u2019AADNC, de respecter les normes provinciales et les changements qui y sont apport\u00e9s.\n[313] Comme les rapports sur le Programme des SEFPN le signalent, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le financement pr\u00e9vu par la Directive 20\u20111 et l\u2019AAAP est en grande partie fond\u00e9 sur les niveaux de population, les organismes \u00e9loign\u00e9s ou de petite taille sont touch\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e par les mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019AADNC. En Colombie-Britannique, par exemple, on trouve surtout de petits organismes et bon nombre d\u2019entre eux desservent des collectivit\u00e9s rurales et isol\u00e9es. Ces organismes sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es, notamment, aux co\u00fbts de d\u00e9placement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux collectivit\u00e9s desservies, ainsi qu\u2019au recrutement et \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention du personnel (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 87).\n[314] Comme ces organismes sont financ\u00e9s en vertu de la Directive 20\u20111, la plupart ne jouissent pas de la souplesse ou des ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour offrir des services de pr\u00e9vention, m\u00eame avec des fonds additionnels. Dans les collectivit\u00e9s rurales isol\u00e9es, il est \u00e9galement difficile pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations de recevoir les services qui sont offerts hors r\u00e9serves, notamment les services en sant\u00e9 mentale, les services de soutien aux familles et les services favorisant la pr\u00e9servation et la r\u00e9unification des familles (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 43; voir \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 87 et vol. 64, p. 6 et 167). Les organismes de SEFPN de la Colombie-Britannique sont pass\u00e9s \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le de financement fond\u00e9 sur les d\u00e9penses effectivement engag\u00e9es en 2011, avec l\u2019intention d\u2019adopter graduellement l\u2019AAAP peu de temps apr\u00e8s, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines de ces pr\u00e9occupations. Pourtant, et malgr\u00e9 les demandes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es des organismes de SEFPN et de la province de la Colombie-Britannique, cette transition n\u2019avait pas encore eu lieu au moment de l\u2019audience et aucune annonce en ce sens n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans les budgets de 2013 et 2014 (t\u00e9moignage de W. McArthur, Transcription, vol. 63, p. 96 et 97, 156, 172 et 173).\n[315] Les cons\u00e9quences des seuils de population pr\u00e9vus par la Directive 20\u20111, ainsi que des autres hypoth\u00e8ses retenues dans la Directive 20\u20111 et dans l\u2019AAAP, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu\u2019une approche unique ne convient pas pour les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves. La preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montre tr\u00e8s clairement que, parce qu\u2019AADNC ne finance pas les organismes de SEFPN en fonction de leurs besoins r\u00e9els, mais plut\u00f4t sur la base de besoins et de seuils de population hypoth\u00e9tiques, ce financement est insuffisant pour fournir des services essentiels \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans bon nombre de Premi\u00e8res Nations. De plus, les documents internes d\u2019AADNC susmentionn\u00e9s, soit la communication The Way Forward et la communication Renewal of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program, d\u00e9montrent que, bien que des fonds additionnels soient fournis ou r\u00e9affect\u00e9s aux organismes de SEFPN, il y a encore un \u00e9cart important \u00e0 combler avant que le Programme des SEFPN puisse se comparer aux niveaux de financement des provinces. Nous examinerons de fa\u00e7on plus approfondie ce probl\u00e8me dans la section qui suit.\nc. Preuve comparative\n[316] AADNC soutient que la comparaison est un aspect essentiel de toute analyse effectu\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime des lois sur les droits de la personne. Selon AADNC, les plaignantes n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour expliquer comment les mod\u00e8les de financement des provinces ou des territoires fonctionnent ou pour comparer leurs budgets respectifs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, par rapport \u00e0 celui du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, AADNC soutient que le Tribunal devrait tirer une conclusion n\u00e9gative du fait que les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas fait entendre de t\u00e9moins provinciaux ou territoriaux.\n[317] Selon AADNC, la th\u00e8se des plaignantes p\u00eache par l\u2019absence de preuves solides concernant le niveau du financement provincial par rapport au financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il ajoute que les plaignantes n\u2019ont soumis aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve portant sur la nature, ou l\u2019ampleur, des recherches sur la question. De plus, aucun t\u00e9moin des provinces ou des territoires n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 pour appuyer l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il existe une diff\u00e9rence dans l\u2019ampleur du financement ou des niveaux de services en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves et hors des r\u00e9serves. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la comparaison entre le financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le financement provincial se situe au c\u0153ur de leur th\u00e8se, AADNC affirme que les plaignantes devaient d\u00e9montrer la proportion du financement consacr\u00e9e aux services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et par chacun des gouvernements provincial ou territorial. Ce n\u2019est que si la part du financement fourni par chaque palier est \u00e9tablie de fa\u00e7on fiable que le Tribunal peut, selon AADNC, d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence et, si cette diff\u00e9rence permet de conclure que les plaignantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9es de services. Selon AADNC, une perception de diff\u00e9rence dans la prestation de services fournis dans les r\u00e9serves ou hors des r\u00e9serves ne suffit pas pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 des pr\u00e9tentions des plaignantes.\n[318] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, AADNC soutient qu\u2019aucune comparaison entre le syst\u00e8me de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le syst\u00e8me de financement provincial ou territorial sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP n\u2019est valide.\n[319] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et le Tribunal ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument d\u2019AADNC concernant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une preuve comparative et le fait que toute comparaison entre le syst\u00e8me de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le syst\u00e8me de financement provincial ou territorial serait invalide, s\u2019agissant de la LCDP. Le m\u00eame argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu dans la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par AADNC relativement \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence (2011 TCDP 4). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu ce qui suit, lorsqu\u2019elle a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur cette requ\u00eate, au paragraphe 251 de la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF :\nLe Tribunal a commis une erreur en concluant que dans son sens ordinaire, l\u2019expression \u00ab differentiate adversely \u00bb utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) exige un groupe de comparaison dans tous les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a discrimination dans la prestation de services. Cette conclusion est d\u00e9raisonnable, car elle va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet et de l\u2019esprit de la loi, et donne lieu \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats manifestement absurdes que le l\u00e9gislateur ne saurait avoir souhait\u00e9s.\n[320] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 certains des r\u00e9sultats manifestement absurdes auxquels on aboutirait en exigeant un groupe de comparaison dans chaque cas :\n[256] Suivant l\u2019analyse faite par le Tribunal, l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9cide en toute lucidit\u00e9 de moins payer son unique employ\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elle est une femme, parce qu\u2019elle est noire ou parce qu\u2019elle est musulmane n\u2019aurait pas commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun autre employ\u00e9 \u00e0 qui l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9.\n[257] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le commer\u00e7ant qui force son employ\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans l\u2019arri\u00e8re-boutique apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9couvert qu\u2019il est gai n\u2019aurait pas commis un acte discriminatoire si aucune autre personne n\u2019\u00e9tait employ\u00e9e de cet \u00e9tablissement.\n[\u2026]\n[259] Dans les exemples pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, des personnes sont clairement d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es dans leur emploi en raison de leur appartenance \u00e0 un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Toutefois, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Tribunal, aucun recours ne leur serait ouvert en vertu de la Loi. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation ne s\u2019harmonise pas avec l\u2019objet de la loi et est d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF, par. 256 et 257, 259)\n[321] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le r\u00f4le que jouent les groupes de comparaison dans une analyse de discrimination ainsi que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Withler c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 12 (Withler), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tenu les propos suivants quant au recours \u00e0 des groupes de comparaison pour analyser une all\u00e9gation de discrimination envers les peuples autochtones :\n[332] Les Autochtones occupent une position unique au sein de la structure constitutionnelle et juridique du Canada.\n[\u2026]\n[337] Si l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi comme le fait le Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il faut dans tous les cas faire une comparaison avec un groupe aux caract\u00e9ristiques identiques pour pouvoir \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dans la prestation des services, sa d\u00e9cision signifie que, contrairement aux autres Canadiens, les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations se verront limit\u00e9s dans leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir la protection de la Loi s\u2019ils estiment \u00eatre victimes de discrimination dans la prestation d\u2019un service gouvernemental en raison de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique. Ce r\u00e9sultat n\u2019est pas raisonnable.\n[\u2026]\n[340] Je conviens \u00e9galement avec les demanderesses qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) qui accepte le statut sui generis des Premi\u00e8res Nations et qui reconna\u00eet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019adopter des approches diff\u00e9rentes pour \u00e9valuer les demandes fond\u00e9es sur la discrimination, selon le contexte social, est conforme aux valeurs de la Charte.\n(Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF, par. 332, 337 et 340)\n[322] En appel, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a retenu le raisonnement suivi par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet du recours \u00e0 des groupes de comparaison dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse de discrimination. En fait, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que des d\u00e9cisions rendues apr\u00e8s celles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale confirmaient le r\u00f4le de moins en moins important que jouent les groupes de comparaison dans cette analyse :\nPar l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), la Cour supr\u00eame a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019existence d\u2019un groupe de comparaison n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la discrimination; il s\u2019agit tout au plus d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve utile. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019en insistant sur la comparaison avec un groupe aux caract\u00e9ristiques identiques, il y aurait un retour au formalisme, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, et qu\u2019on \u00ab risquerait de perp\u00e9tuer exactement le d\u00e9savantage ainsi que l\u2019exclusion de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ordinaire que le Code [des droits de la personne] est cens\u00e9 corriger \u00bb (aux paragraphes 30 et 31). \u00ab Il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a discrimination, point \u00e0 la ligne \u00bb et non de se concentrer sur l\u2019existence de groupe de comparaison (au paragraphe 60).\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. A., 2013 CSC 5, au paragraphe 346 (la juge Abella, pour la majorit\u00e9), la Cour supr\u00eame a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab une analyse fond\u00e9e sur la comparaison avec un groupe aux caract\u00e9ristiques identiques ne permet pas toujours de d\u00e9tecter l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et risque de se muer en recherche de la similitude, de court-circuiter le deuxi\u00e8me volet de l\u2019analyse de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et de se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler difficile \u00e0 appliquer \u00bb (Withler, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60).

De plus, aucune jurisprudence n\u2019appuie sa proposition qu\u2019une comparaison entre les provinces et territoires n\u2019est pas valide sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP.\n[324] Bien que la Cour supr\u00eame ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 est un concept comparatif, elle a \u00e9galement reconnu que \u00ab [\u2026] toute diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre des individus dans la loi ne produira pas forc\u00e9ment une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 et [\u2026] un traitement identique peut fr\u00e9quemment engendrer de graves in\u00e9galit\u00e9s \u00bb (Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 RCS 143, p. 164 [Andrews]). S\u2019agissant de cette derni\u00e8re affirmation, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 2 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Withler, que, ce qui compte, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, et non l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 formelle :\n\u00c0 notre avis, la question principale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et dans les autres litiges fond\u00e9s sur le par. 15(1), consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la mesure l\u00e9gislative contest\u00e9e va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la norme fondamentale d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle \u00e9tablie par le par. 15(1) : Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143. Pour ce faire, il faut prendre en compte le contexte global de l\u2019affaire, y compris l\u2019incidence r\u00e9elle de la mesure sur les demanderesses et les membres du groupe auquel elles appartiennent. Le paragraphe 15(1) est centr\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, et non sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 formelle. Une d\u00e9marche ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 formelle, fond\u00e9e sur la comparaison avec un groupe aux caract\u00e9ristiques identiques, pourrait nuire \u00e0 l\u2019analyse. Il faut se garder de transformer l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle en recherche formaliste et arbitraire du groupe de comparaison \u00ab appropri\u00e9 \u00bb. En d\u00e9finitive, une seule question se pose : La mesure contest\u00e9e transgresse\u2011t\u2011elle la norme d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle consacr\u00e9e par le par. 15(1) de la Charte?\n[325] Comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CAF, les arr\u00eats Moore et Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. A., 2013 CSC 5 (A), r\u00e9it\u00e8rent l\u2019approche des groupes de comparaison \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Withler. Autrement dit, bien que le recours \u00e0 une preuve comparative puisse s\u2019av\u00e9rer utile pour analyser une all\u00e9gation de discrimination, elle ne tranche pas la question. En fait, ainsi que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Withler, au paragraphe 59 : \u00ab il peut \u00eatre impossible de trouver un groupe de comparaison pr\u00e9sentant des caract\u00e9ristiques identiques, car l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la personne ou du groupe en cause peut reposer essentiellement sur le fait que, compte tenu de leur situation et de leurs besoins distincts, il n\u2019existe aucun groupe analogue auquel ils puissent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[326] Il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte du contexte global de l\u2019affaire et de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents, y compris toute preuve comparative (Withler, par. 2). Comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 27 (Morris), la d\u00e9finition juridique de la preuve prima facie n\u2019exige pas que le plaignant soumette un type particulier de preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir les faits n\u00e9cessaires en vue de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. La question de savoir si la preuve fournie dans un cas donn\u00e9 est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire est une question mixte de fait et de droit. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morris, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu ce qui suit, au paragraphe 28 :\nUn crit\u00e8re juridique souple, en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie, permet mieux que d\u2019autres crit\u00e8res plus pr\u00e9cis de promouvoir l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sous\u2011tendant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9limination, dans la sph\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi ainsi que de la discrimination en ce qui concerne la prestation de biens, de services, d\u2019installations et d\u2019habitations. La discrimination prend des formes nouvelles et subtiles.\n[327] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le Tribunal signale que la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu des alin\u00e9as 5a) et 5b) de la LCDP. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du libell\u00e9 de la version anglaise de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b), \u00ab to differentiate adversely \u00bb a servi de fondement \u00e0 une grande partie de l\u2019argument invoqu\u00e9 par AADNC pour affirmer qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9senter une preuve comparative. Autrement dit, en anglais, \u00ab to differentiate \u00bb signifie traiter une personne de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente par rapport aux autres. La version fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) n\u2019a pas cette connotation comparative, puisqu\u2019on y trouve simplement le verbe \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb. De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) de la version anglaise n\u2019emploie pas de termes qui impliquerait une comparaison. On y parle seulement du fait de priver un individu d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF, exiger une preuve comparative dans le cas des plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b), mais non dans le cas de celles fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) cr\u00e9erait une incoh\u00e9rence entre ces alin\u00e9as. En effet, les exigences en mati\u00e8re de droit et de preuve pour \u00e9tablir la discrimination au sens de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces alin\u00e9as seraient diff\u00e9rentes (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien CF, par. 276 \u00e0 279).\n[328] L\u2019argument d\u2019AADNC selon lequel on ne peut pas comparer diff\u00e9rents fournisseurs de services, ou des fournisseurs de provinces ou territoires diff\u00e9rents, ne trouve pas davantage d\u2019appui dans la LCDP ou dans la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e dans les paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents au sujet de la preuve comparative. En fait, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP permet au Tribunal de recevoir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ou les renseignements, qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9s, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas de renseignements confidentiels [par. 50(4)] ou du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un conciliateur [par. 50(5)]. De plus, la comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable avec les normes provinciales, ou territoriales, fait partie de l\u2019objectif que s\u2019est lui-m\u00eame fix\u00e9 AADNC pour mettre en \u0153uvre le Programme des SEFPN, ainsi que pour n\u00e9gocier d\u2019autres ententes provinciales et territoriales. Bien qu\u2019AADNC soutienne que la \u00ab comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable \u00bb est une expression administrative, et non une expression juridique qui exige que des services analogues soient fournis tant dans les r\u00e9serves qu\u2019hors r\u00e9serves, cet argument n\u2019a aucune incidence sur la capacit\u00e9 des plaignantes de soumettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet. AADNC s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 garantir aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux fournis aux personnes se trouvant hors r\u00e9serves dans des situations analogues. Il est d\u00e9raisonnable et injustifi\u00e9 de soutenir que les plaignantes ne devraient pas pouvoir pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce propos.\n[329] Il n\u2019y a aucune obligation de soumettre une preuve comparative pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de discrimination. Toutefois, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve comparatifs ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existait une diff\u00e9rence entre le financement et les niveaux des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille fournis dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serves. En premier lieu, les organismes de SEFPN qui sont toujours assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111 re\u00e7oivent moins de financement que ceux qui ont effectu\u00e9 la transition \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans le Rapport Le Point de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada (2011), le financement de l\u2019exploitation et des services de pr\u00e9vention a connu une augmentation de 50 \u00e0 100 % dans chacune des provinces ayant instaur\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP (p. 29, art. 4.54). De plus, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, AADNC a estim\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence de financement annuel n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der au transfert vers l\u2019AAAP dans les autres provinces et territoires \u00e0 21 millions de dollars pour la Colombie-Britannique; \u00e0 2 millions de dollars pour le Yukon; \u00e0 5 millions de dollars pour l\u2019Ontario; \u00e0 2 millions de dollars pour le Nouveau-Brunswick et \u00e0 2 millions de dollars pour Terre\u2011Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador (Communication The Way Forward, p. 15). Ainsi que Mme D\u2019Amico l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience :\n[traduction]\nMembre LUSTIG : D\u2019accord. Peut\u2011on dire \u00e0 juste titre que bien que vous vous soyez d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis r\u00e9solument \u00e0 la t\u00e2che et que vous tentiez d\u2019aborder la question des failles de la formule de financement sous divers angles, on ne peut pas encore parler de comparabilit\u00e9 et que c\u2019est un objectif que vous essayez encore d\u2019atteindre?\nMme D\u2019AMICO : Je peux vous affirmer que, dans six provinces, l\u2019objectif de la comparabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint. Dans les autres provinces et territoires o\u00f9 l\u2019AAAP n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, les fonds qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent sont plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux que pr\u00e9voit la Directive 20\u20111. Cependant, je ne pourrais pas vous affirmer avec certitude qu\u2019ils sont comparables \u00e0 ceux vers\u00e9s par la province en termes de ratios de financement car, dans le cas de la Directive 20\u20111, m\u00eame en tenant compte des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires, nous avons pass\u00e9 en revue les mod\u00e8les dans le cas des autres provinces et territoires et avons constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elles recevraient davantage avec l\u2019AAAP en tenant compte de tous ces ratios.\n(Transcription, vol. 51, p. 179\u2011180)\n[330] Deuxi\u00e8mement, AADNC a constat\u00e9 que le financement doit \u00eatre augment\u00e9 m\u00eame dans le cas des provinces et territoires qui ont adopt\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP, si l\u2019on veut assurer une comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable avec les provinces. Par ailleurs, la communication The Way Forward affirme ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019enveloppe de financement de l\u2019AAAP peut ne pas r\u00e9pondre aux facteurs de co\u00fbt provinciaux ou aux pressions sur le financement qui sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle des organismes \u00bb (p. 15). Pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me, la communication propose d\u2019ajuster le mod\u00e8le d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des co\u00fbts de l\u2019AAAP en augmentant les fonds pour tenir compte des facteurs de co\u00fbt. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019\u00ab AAAP Plus \u00bb. La communication The Way Forward estime que les co\u00fbts n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre en \u0153uvre ce financement am\u00e9lior\u00e9 dans les provinces et territoires qui ne sont pas encore assujettis \u00e0 l\u2019AAAP se chiffrent \u00e0 65,03 millions de dollars. Les fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires de l\u2019AAAP Plus \u00e0 injecter dans les provinces ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP sont estim\u00e9s \u00e0 43,10 millions de dollars. Selon la communication The Way Forward, l\u2019AAAP Plus garantit [traduction] \u00ab [...] que le financement demeure raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 celui des provinces et des territoires [...] \u00bb (p. 16). Les t\u00e9moins d\u2019AADNC ont expliqu\u00e9 que les chiffres que l\u2019on trouve dans la communication The Way Forward sont des estimations approximatives qui tendent \u00e0 p\u00eacher par exc\u00e8s. N\u00e9anmoins, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019ils donnent une bonne id\u00e9e de l\u2019ampleur des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour offrir des services dignes de ce nom aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon.\n[331] De plus, ces chiffres s\u2019apparentent \u00e0 ceux qui sont recommand\u00e9s dans le rapport Wen:De no 3 (p. 33). Le rapport Wen:De no 3 mettait \u00e9galement en garde contre l\u2019adoption de ses recommandations \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce en expliquant que l\u2019on risquait ainsi de compromettre l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des changements propos\u00e9s (p. 15). Toutefois, comme la mise en oeuvre de l\u2019AAAP ne corrige pas toutes les failles de la Directive 20\u20111, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP se voit maintenant compromise, comme l\u2019indique la communication The Way Forward.\n[332] Une troisi\u00e8me comparaison se d\u00e9gage par ailleurs de la communication The Way Forward. La communication recommande \u00e0 AADNC de transf\u00e9rer aux provinces et aux territoires les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts dans les r\u00e9serves, pour r\u00e9soudre la question de la comparabilit\u00e9. Elle reconna\u00eet que les provinces et les territoires ont des comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Ils sont donc mieux plac\u00e9s pour contr\u00f4ler la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves et faire respecter les normes, si on leur confie l\u2019ensemble des responsabilit\u00e9s, y compris celle du financement. Toutefois, la communication signale qu\u2019en retenant cette option, [traduction] \u00ab on risque d\u2019assister \u00e0 une hausse consid\u00e9rable des co\u00fbts \u00bb pour AADNC (communication The Way Forward, p. 17).\n[333] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, une autre comparaison utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a trait \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille au moyen du Programme des SEFPN et la prestation des m\u00eames services dans le cadre de l\u2019Entente portant r\u00e9forme de l\u2019Alberta, du Protocole d\u2019entente de la C\u2011B et de l\u2019Entente de services de la C\u2011B. AADNC soutient que ces ententes ne prouvent pas la mani\u00e8re dont la province finance les personnes vivant hors r\u00e9serves, ni que les organismes de SEFPN souffrent d\u2019un sous\u2011financement de la part d\u2019AADNC. Toutefois, ces arguments ne tiennent pas compte du fait que les organismes de SEFPN sont financ\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente que les provinces, qui re\u00e7oivent des remboursements d\u2019AADNC. Le financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Alberta et \u00e0 la Colombie-Britannique selon ces ententes n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur les niveaux de population, ou des hypoth\u00e8ses concernant les enfants pris en charge et les familles dans le besoin. AADNC rembourse plut\u00f4t aux provinces les frais qu\u2019elles ont effectivement engag\u00e9s, ou une part convenue des frais de prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Les provinces re\u00e7oivent des ajustements pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation et des augmentations du co\u00fbt des services, tandis que les organismes de SEFPN n\u2019y ont pas droit. Mais surtout, comme on rembourse chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 ces provinces les frais effectivement engag\u00e9s et, comme elles b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un ajustement des co\u00fbts, il y a un lien plus direct entre les normes en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des provinces en question et la prestation de ces services aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations qu\u2019elles desservent.\n[334] En comparaison, ni la Directive 20\u20111 ni l\u2019AAAP ne pr\u00e9voient d\u2019ajustements pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie ou des changements apport\u00e9s aux lois et aux normes provinciales. Le rapport Wen:De no 2 a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de ces deux types d\u2019ajustements constitua une lacune majeure de la Directive 20\u20111. Pourtant, malgr\u00e9 ces constats, le mod\u00e8le de l\u2019AAAP a repris ces m\u00eames lacunes. Ainsi que le rapport Wen:De no 2 le pr\u00e9cise, le fait de ne pas ajuster le financement pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie m\u00e8ne au sous-financement des services et \u00e0 une distorsion dans les services financ\u00e9s (p. 51). De plus, comme il ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019ajustement pour tenir compte des changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation et aux normes provinciales, le Programme des SEFPN ne contient toujours aucun m\u00e9canisme garantissant que les services offerts aux enfants et aux familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves sont raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux offerts aux enfants et aux familles vivant hors r\u00e9serves, dans des circonstances similaires (rapport Wen:De no 2, p. 50).\n[335] L\u2019argument d\u2019AADNC au sujet de l\u2019absence de preuve comparative des plaignantes m\u00e9conna\u00eet par ailleurs le fait que l\u2019EPN, les rapports Wen:De et les rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et du Comit\u00e9 permanent, ont tous signal\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019AADNC proc\u00e8de \u00e0 cette analyse et ont recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il le fasse. De plus, en r\u00e9ponse aux rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et du Comit\u00e9 permanent qui recommandaient \u00e0 AADNC de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse comparative des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serves, AADNC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait pas fait en raison des difficult\u00e9s que comportait ce travail. Malgr\u00e9 ces difficult\u00e9s, la \u00ab comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable \u00bb demeure une norme d\u2019AADNC dans le cas du Programme des SEFPN.\n[336] Les difficult\u00e9s que comporte l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette analyse comparative ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans un document intitul\u00e9 Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC, pour \u00eatre vers\u00e9 \u00e0 un dossier d\u2019information minist\u00e9riel (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 44). Ce document explique qu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 des chiffres concluants et comparables pour diverses raisons telles que les diff\u00e9rences qui caract\u00e9risent la prestation des programmes sociaux dans les provinces sur le plan du type de services, le nombre de services et la r\u00e9partition du financement, (Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, p. 1). De plus, les donn\u00e9es provinciales ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas directement comparables, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elles peuvent inclure des co\u00fbts tels que les frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, ou les co\u00fbts de programme qui ne sont pas financ\u00e9s par l\u2019entremise du Programme des SEFPN (Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, p. 4). Lorsque l\u2019on compare les d\u00e9penses totales par enfant pris en charge, il semblerait qu\u2019AADNC finance les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille davantage que ne le font certaines provinces. Toutefois, le document intitul\u00e9 Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, \u00e0 la page 4, signale que les niveaux de financement ne correspondent pas aux v\u00e9ritables besoins des enfants et de leurs familles :\n[traduction]\nCette analyse n\u2019est pas en mesure de reconna\u00eetre que les groupes d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s peuvent avoir de plus grands besoins en mati\u00e8re de services (en raison de la pauvret\u00e9, des mauvaises conditions de logement, de graves probl\u00e8mes d\u2019alcoolisme ou de toxicomanie et de violence familiale) ou que les options en mati\u00e8re de services ou de placement dont ces groupes ont besoin peuvent co\u00fbter beaucoup plus cher.\n[337] Mme D\u2019Amico a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 la difficult\u00e9 de comparer les services fournis par les organismes de SEFPN avec ceux fournis par les provinces :\n[traduction]\nMme CHAN : [\u2026] Pouvez\u2011vous savoir, ou encore les responsables du programme peuvent\u2011ils savoir si les services sont comparables par rapport \u00e0 ceux fournis \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9serve?\nMme D\u2019AMICO : Je ne crois pas que cela soit possible.\n[\u2026]\nParce que nous parlons de diff\u00e9rents types de collectivit\u00e9s, de diff\u00e9rents types de syst\u00e8mes et de diff\u00e9rents types de services administr\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents prestataires de services. Ce que je veux dire par l\u00e0, c\u2019est qu\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 de Premi\u00e8res Nations hors r\u00e9serve qui ressemble en tout point \u00e0 une autre collectivit\u00e9 hors r\u00e9serve ne va pas recevoir exactement les m\u00eames services que cette autre collectivit\u00e9. Elles vont recevoir les services adapt\u00e9s culturellement que cet organisme estime appropri\u00e9s en fonction des enfants et des familles qu\u2019il dessert.\n(Transcription, vol. 51, p. 183)\n[338] En raison de ces difficult\u00e9s, Mme D\u2019Amico a expliqu\u00e9 que le financement offert par AADNC ne reposait pas sur la comparabilit\u00e9 des niveaux de services offerts, dans les r\u00e9serves et hors r\u00e9serve, aux enfants et aux familles, mais simplement sur le maintien de niveaux de financement comparables avec la province :\n[traduction]\nMme D\u2019AMICO : Parce que dans le cas de l\u2019AAAP nous avons \u2013 nous finan\u00e7ons pr\u00e9sentement en fonction des m\u00eames salaires et des m\u00eames ratios de dotation que la province \u2013 et ce sont les seules variables comparables que nous avons pu trouver. Cela n\u2019a donc rien \u00e0 voir avec la prestation des services, mais bien avec le financement \u2013 nous avons donc trouv\u00e9 des variables comparables pour d\u00e9terminer comment la province finance les services.\n(Transcription, vol. 51, p. 103)\n[339] Toutefois, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, m\u00eame les salaires sont fixes lorsque l\u2019AAAP est mise en \u0153uvre et, en Alberta par exemple, on applique toujours, en 2014, les \u00e9chelles salariales de 2006. De plus, ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans le document intitul\u00e9 Comparability of Provincial and INAC Social Programs Funding, une approche de la comparabilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le financement, et non sur les niveaux de service, m\u00e9conna\u00eet le fait que les Premi\u00e8res Nations ont besoin de plus de services, ou que les options de services ou de placements dont elles ont besoin peuvent co\u00fbter beaucoup plus cher.\n[340] Ce dernier point permet au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une comparaison concr\u00e8te entre les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts tant dans les r\u00e9serves que hors des r\u00e9serves, en se fondant sur le principe de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant.\niv. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant et le principe de Jordan\n[341] Hors r\u00e9serve, l\u2019accent est mis sur les niveaux de services et les besoins des enfants et des familles et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, sur les mesures les moins perturbatrices. En revanche, dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, l\u2019accent est mis sur les niveaux de financement et l\u2019application de mod\u00e8les de financement selon lesquels les montants pour la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices sont fixes et les fonds consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la prise en charge des enfants sont couverts au prix co\u00fbtant.\n[342] Les lois et les normes provinciales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance sont ax\u00e9es sur la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices (par exemple, en Ontario, la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, art. 1; en Alberta, le Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, art. 2; au Manitoba, la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfant et \u00e0 la famille, D\u00e9claration de principes et art. 2; en Saskatchewan, la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, art. 3 \u00e0 5; en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, le Children and Family Services Act, Pr\u00e9ambule et art. 2, 13 et 20; en Colombie\u2011Britannique, le Child, Family and Community Service Act, art. 2, 4 et 30 et au Qu\u00e9bec, la Loi sur la protection de la jeunesse, art. 1 \u00e0 4). Ces lois reconnaissent le principe qu\u2019un enfant ne devrait \u00eatre retir\u00e9 de sa famille, de son milieu ou de sa collectivit\u00e9, que lorsque toutes les autres mesures les moins perturbatrices ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9es et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune autre solution.\n[343] L\u2019accent qui est mis sur les mesures les moins perturbatrices reconna\u00eet les cons\u00e9quences importantes qu\u2019entra\u00eene la s\u00e9paration des familles. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Office des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfant et \u00e0 la famille de Winnipeg c. K.L.W., 2000 CSC 48, au paragraphe 78, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada explique les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une ordonnance de placement d\u2019un enfant en famille d\u2019accueil :\nLa forme d\u2019intervention la plus perturbatrice est l\u2019ordonnance du tribunal conf\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019Office la tutelle temporaire ou permanente d\u2019un enfant. Surtout dans le cas d\u2019une ordonnance de tutelle permanente, cela peut rompre pour toujours les liens juridiques entre les parents et les enfants. Pour rendre une telle ordonnance, le tribunal doit conclure que l\u2019enfant a besoin de protection au sens de la loi applicable. En outre, il doit conclure que \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant \u00bb dicte un changement de tutelle temporaire ou permanent. Comme le juge en chef Lamer l\u2019a fait remarquer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat G. (J.), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 76 : \u00ab Peu d\u2019actes gouvernementaux peuvent avoir des r\u00e9percussions plus profondes sur la vie des parents et de l\u2019enfant. \u00bb\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[344] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, les lois et les normes des provinces dictent que l\u2019on doit explorer toutes les solutions de rechange qui s\u2019offrent avant de placer un enfant, ce qui va dans le sens des saines pratiques en mati\u00e8re de travail social d\u00e9crites pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.. Toutefois, en remboursant les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien au prix co\u00fbtant et en accordant des budgets fixes insuffisants pour la pr\u00e9vention, les mod\u00e8les de financement d\u2019AADNC incitent \u00e0 retirer les enfants de leur milieu familial comme solution de premier, et non de dernier, recours. Le niveau de financement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 certains organismes de SEFPN, particuli\u00e8rement ceux qui sont assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111, fait en sorte qu\u2019il leur est difficile, voire impossible, d\u2019assurer des services de pr\u00e9vention et de prendre les mesures les moins perturbatrices. M\u00eame dans le cas des organismes ayant adopt\u00e9 l\u2019AAAP, qui pr\u00e9voit un financement distinct pour la pr\u00e9vention, le mod\u00e8le ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019ajustements pour l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts qui survient avec le temps au chapitre des salaires, des avantages sociaux, des d\u00e9penses en immobilisation, des frais de d\u00e9placement et du co\u00fbt de la vie. Dans ces conditions, il est difficile pour les organismes de SEFPN d\u2019attirer et de retenir du personnel et, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, de suivre les exigences provinciales. La o\u00f9 les hypoth\u00e8ses int\u00e9gr\u00e9es aux mod\u00e8les de financement en termes de nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge, de familles dans le besoin et de niveaux de population, ne refl\u00e8tent pas les besoins r\u00e9els des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations, il est encore plus difficile pour les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations de respecter les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles provinciales. Ces exigences peuvent inclure, outre celles que nous venons de mentionner, les honoraires d\u2019avocats, les frais de repr\u00e9sentation de la bande, les primes d\u2019assurances, ainsi que les modifications apport\u00e9es aux normes de service provinciales ou territoriales.\n[345] Les fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC en charge du Programme des SEFPN ont expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne sont pas des experts dans le domaine de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et qu\u2019ils s\u2019en remettent aux lois et aux normes provinciales pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019ampleur du financement \u00e0 accorder aux r\u00e9serves. Ils appliquent pourtant, pour financer les organismes de SEFPN, une formule qui ne tient pas compte des normes fix\u00e9es par les lois provinciales en ce qui a trait aux mesures les moins perturbatrices. Il est \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur qu\u2019en ce qui concerne le financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, les provinces n\u2019appliquent pas un mod\u00e8le de financement :\n[traduction]\nMme CHAN : Pour ce qui est du financement, avez\u2011vous eu connaissance de formules de financement provinciales pour calculer le paiement effectu\u00e9 par la province pour les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance?\nMme D\u2019AMICO : Pas encore.\nMme CHAN : Quelles difficult\u00e9s, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, cela cause\u2011t\u2011il au programme pour ce qui est de la fa\u00e7on de calculer le financement?\nMme D\u2019AMICO : Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 notre principal d\u00e9fi : essayer de savoir comment financer \u00e9quitablement ou de mani\u00e8re comparable, parce que nous demandons constamment aux provinces de nous fournir une formule de financement pour un organisme ou un bureau r\u00e9gional de la province et de nous expliquer en quoi elle consiste pour nous permettre de la r\u00e9utiliser et d\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9s de respecter la fameuse comparabilit\u00e9 provinciale.\n[\u2026]\nLes provinces n\u2019ont pas de tableau comparatif; elles financent selon une foule de facteurs. Vous savez, un exemple que je peux vous donner est la Colombie-Britannique qui compte cinq bureaux r\u00e9gionaux diff\u00e9rents; ces cinq bureaux r\u00e9gionaux ont des grilles salariales diff\u00e9rentes, des budgets d\u2019exploitation diff\u00e9rents qui ne sont pas fond\u00e9s sur une formule particuli\u00e8re.\nIl est donc tr\u00e8s difficile de trouver des donn\u00e9es comparables pour assurer la comparabilit\u00e9. On se retrouve litt\u00e9ralement avec des pommes et des oranges.\nDonc, comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, ce sont ces variables [\u2026] que nous avons r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir de la province pour pouvoir en tenir compte dans notre mod\u00e8le et obtenir, tout d\u2019abord, un mod\u00e8le \u00e0 tout le moins coh\u00e9rent, partout au pays, mais aussi un mod\u00e8le adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque province en fonction de la comparabilit\u00e9 provinciale et des variables provinciales.\nIl n\u2019y a donc rien d\u2019absolu pour ce qui est des modalit\u00e9s de service. Si un service est offert dans une collectivit\u00e9, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement offert dans une autre collectivit\u00e9, m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019une r\u00e9serve. La situation est donc tr\u00e8s difficile et les services varient car il y a beaucoup de services diff\u00e9rents que les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et d\u2019autres partenaires communautaires peuvent offrir dans toute la gamme des services sociaux.\n(Transcription, vol. 51, p. 184 \u00e0 186)\n[346] L\u2019accent mis sur les services de pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices dans les lois provinciales susmentionn\u00e9es est indissociable du concept de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant, un principe juridique qui rev\u00eat une importance primordiale, tant en droit canadien qu\u2019en droit international (Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CSC 4, par. 9; Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 RCS 817, par. 75 [Baker]). Comme l\u2019explique le professeur Nicholas Bala :\n[traduction]\n[L]es arr\u00eats de principe canadiens, les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales et les trait\u00e9s internationaux posent tous comme principe que les d\u00e9cisions concernant les enfants doivent se fonder sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un concept fondamental pour ceux qui prennent des d\u00e9cisions impliquant un enfant, non seulement les juges et les avocats, mais \u00e9galement les \u00e9valuateurs et les m\u00e9diateurs.\n(Bala, Nicholas, \u00ab The Best Interests of the Child in the Post\u2011Modernist Era: Central but Illusive and Limited Concept \u00bb, dans Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada 2000: Family Law (Toronto, LSUC, 1999), p. 3.1)\n[347] On constate un \u00e9cart entre, d\u2019une part, les objectifs du Programme des SEFPN de fournir dans les r\u00e9serves des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, raisonnablement comparables \u00e0 ceux offerts hors r\u00e9serve et conformes \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant ainsi qu\u2019au principe de l\u2019unit\u00e9 des familles et, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019application effective du programme dans le cadre de la Directive 20\u20111 et de l\u2019AAAP. L\u00e0 encore, alors que les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien sont couvertes au prix co\u00fbtant, le financement des mesures de pr\u00e9vention et des mesures les moins perturbatrices est fond\u00e9 sur des co\u00fbts fixes, sans tenir compte des besoins pr\u00e9cis des collectivit\u00e9s ou des familles et des enfants qui y vivent.\n[348] L\u2019\u00e9cart entre les objectifs et la mise en application concr\u00e8te du programme est \u00e9galement illustr\u00e9 par le manque de financement des repr\u00e9sentants de bande en Ontario, sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Non seulement les repr\u00e9sentants de bande permettent\u2011ils de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins en mati\u00e8re de services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, mais ils servent aussi \u00e0 garder les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s ensemble et leur r\u00f4le est express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu par la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario.\n[349] Les effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les pages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes sont le r\u00e9sultat du contr\u00f4le qu\u2019exerce AADNC sur la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations et au Yukon par l\u2019application des mod\u00e8les de financement pr\u00e9vus par le Programme des SEFPN et l\u2019Entente de 1965. Ces mod\u00e8les sont structur\u00e9s de telle sorte qu\u2019ils d\u00e9favorisent les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en incitant au placement des enfants hors de leur famille. Il s\u2019ensuit que bon nombre des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de demeurer unis ou d\u2019\u00eatre rapidement r\u00e9unis.\n[350] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les plaignantes soul\u00e8vent un autre facteur important dans l\u2019analyse de la diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019attribution du financement pr\u00e9vu par AADNC aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations et celui des provinces,. Ce facteur ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019application du principe de Jordan.\n[351] Le principe de Jordan est un principe qui place l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant en premier. Il pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu\u2019un service gouvernemental est offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants et qu\u2019un conflit de comp\u00e9tences surgit entre le Canada et une province ou un territoire, ou entre des minist\u00e8res du m\u00eame gouvernement, au sujet de services offerts \u00e0 l\u2019enfant d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour les services. Il peut demander \u00e0 \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 par l\u2019autre minist\u00e8re ou gouvernement, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019enfant ait re\u00e7u le service. Ce principe vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations se voient refuser des services publics essentiels ou qu\u2019ils soient laiss\u00e9s en attente de services.\n[352] Le principe de Jordan a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 en l\u2019honneur de Jordan River Anderson, un jeune gar\u00e7on n\u00e9 en 1999 dans une famille de la Premi\u00e8re Nation crie de Norway House. Jordan avait un grave probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et, \u00e0 cause du manque de services dans la r\u00e9serve, sa famille l\u2019avait confi\u00e9 aux soins de la province afin qu\u2019il puisse obtenir les traitements m\u00e9dicaux dont il avait besoin. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 les deux premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de sa vie \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il aurait pu recevoir des soins \u00e0 domicile dans un foyer d\u2019accueil sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de son \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mais au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi, AADNC, Sant\u00e9 Canada et la province du Manitoba se sont renvoy\u00e9 la balle pour savoir qui devait financer les soins \u00e0 domicile de Jordan. Jordan est donc demeur\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9. Ils se disputaient toujours lorsque Jordan est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de cinq ans, apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 toute sa vie dans un h\u00f4pital.\n[353] Le 31 octobre 2007, Mme Jean Crowder, d\u00e9put\u00e9e de Nanaimo\u2011Cowichan, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Chambre des communes la motion 296, qui \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9e :\nQue, de l\u2019avis de la Chambre, le gouvernement devrait imm\u00e9diatement adopter le principe de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le principe de Jordan, afin de r\u00e9soudre les conflits de comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations.\nCette motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2007 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 45).\n[354] En r\u00e9ponse, AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont sign\u00e9 un protocole d\u2019entente intitul\u00e9 Memorandum of Understanding on the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 46 [MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle]; voir \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de C. Baggley, Transcription, vol. 57, p. 9 \u00e0 13, 23, 40 et 41, 84 et 85). Dans le document MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, sign\u00e9 par un sous-ministre adjoint de chaque minist\u00e8re, AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont tous les deux reconnu qu\u2019ils avaient un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer pour mettre en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan et qu\u2019ils avaient la responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe de collaborer pour \u00e9laborer et mettre en \u0153uvre une r\u00e9ponse f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (p. 1). Ce protocole d\u2019entente vise \u00e0 aider les deux minist\u00e8res \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les diff\u00e9rends en mati\u00e8re de financement au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils surgissent entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux, de m\u00eame qu\u2019entre les deux minist\u00e8res [traduction] \u00ab [...] et \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les services offerts aux enfants prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan ne sont pas interrompus \u00e0 cause d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend \u00bb (MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, p. 1).\n[355] Le protocole d\u2019entente vise \u00e9galement \u00e0 aider AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 collaborer afin de mettre en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le protocole indique que le r\u00f4le que joue Sant\u00e9 Canada pour faire respecter le principe de Jordan consiste \u00e0 fournir plusieurs services en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ces services incluent, notamment, des services infirmiers, des soins \u00e0 domicile et au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, des programmes communautaires et des services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires. Le r\u00f4le d\u2019AADNC pour faire respecter le principe de Jordan consiste \u00e0 fournir divers programmes sociaux aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, notamment sous forme de programmes d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, d\u2019aide \u00e0 la vie autonome et de soutien du revenu et, enfin, du Programme des SEFPN (MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, p. 1 et 2).\n[356] Une fois qu\u2019une situation dans laquelle le principe de Jordan pourrait s\u2019appliquer a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e, il faut, selon le document MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, examiner les autorisations f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et les politiques des programmes existantes pour d\u00e9terminer si les d\u00e9penses sont admissibles aux termes d\u2019un programme existant et si elles sont couvertes par des fonds minist\u00e9riels existants. Si le diff\u00e9rend sur le financement oppose le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et des gouvernements provinciaux, Sant\u00e9 Canada et AADNC doivent travailler de concert avec la province et les repr\u00e9sentants des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour r\u00e9gler le conflit par une m\u00e9thode de gestion des cas. Sant\u00e9 Canada a re\u00e7u 11 millions de dollars pour financer les biens et les services pendant le r\u00e8glement du diff\u00e9rend (MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, p. 2) afin d\u2019assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas de suspension ou de d\u00e9lai dans la prestation des services. Les fonds ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis annuellement par tranches de trois millions de dollars entre 2009 et 2012. Comme les fonds n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s, leur versement a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 (t\u00e9moignage de C. Baggley, Transcription, vol. 57, p. 123 \u00e0 125).\n[357] Selon le protocole d\u2019entente MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, une structure de gouvernance a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e pour soutenir la communication et le partage de renseignements entre les deux minist\u00e8res sur toute question concernant le principe de Jordan. Cette structure de gouvernance comporte [traduction] \u00ab [...] des mesures favorisant le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends entre les minist\u00e8res, lorsque Sant\u00e9 Canada et AADNC h\u00e9sitent, ou ne s\u2019entendent pas sur le minist\u00e8re ou le gouvernement responsable du financement des biens ou des services selon leurs missions, leurs politiques, ou leurs autorisations respectives \u00bb (MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, p. 2). La structure de gouvernance a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place pour s\u2019assurer que les diff\u00e9rends en mati\u00e8re de financement sont examin\u00e9s et coordonn\u00e9s en temps utile, car il est [traduction] \u00ab essentiel de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins et de prendre des d\u00e9cisions pour s\u2019assurer que les diff\u00e9rends en mati\u00e8re de financement n\u2019interrompent pas les services offerts aux enfants (MOU on Jordan\u2019s Principle, p. 3).\n[358] Sant\u00e9 Canada et AADNC ont renouvel\u00e9 l\u2019entente Memorandum of Understanding on the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle en janvier 2013 (Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 47 [protocole d\u2019entente de 2013 sur le principe de Jordan]). Le protocole d\u2019entente de 2013 sur le principe de Jordan, \u00e9galement sign\u00e9 par un sous-ministre adjoint de chacun des minist\u00e8res, reconna\u00eet que Sant\u00e9 Canada et AADNC [traduction] \u00ab [...] ont un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer pour favoriser une meilleure int\u00e9gration et une meilleure coordination des services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 provinciaux et f\u00e9d\u00e9raux \u00bb (protocole d\u2019entente de 2013 sur le principe de Jordan, p. 1). Le protocole d\u2019entente de 2013 sur le principe de Jordan pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9sormais que, pendant le processus de r\u00e8glement d\u2019un dossier mettant en cause le principe de Jordan, le minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral comp\u00e9tent relativement au programme ou au service en cause cherchera \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019approbation du sous-ministre adjoint pour financer de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9rimaire le service en question, afin d\u2019en assurer la continuit\u00e9.\n[359] Mme Corinne Baggley, gestionnaire principale en mati\u00e8re de politiques \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la politique sociale, familiale et de l\u2019enfance d\u2019AADNC, a expliqu\u00e9 que la r\u00e9ponse f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au principe de Jordan est ax\u00e9e sur les cas mettant en cause un conflit de comp\u00e9tences entre un gouvernement provincial et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et, sur les enfants aux prises avec de multiples handicaps exigeant des services de plusieurs fournisseurs. De plus, le service en question doit \u00eatre un service qui serait offert \u00e0 un enfant r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9serve au m\u00eame endroit (Transcription, vol. 57, p. 9 \u00e0 13; voir \u00e9galement Annexe, pi\u00e8ce 48). Bien qu\u2019elle ait estim\u00e9 qu\u2019environ la moiti\u00e9 des cas recens\u00e9s qui relevaient du principe de Jordan portaient sur des conflits entre des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, Mme Baggley a soulign\u00e9 que la politique avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e sp\u00e9cifiquement en fonction du cas de Jordan (Transcription, vol. 58, p. 24 et 25, 40 et 41).\n[360] Les plaignantes soutiennent que la fa\u00e7on dont AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont formul\u00e9 le principe de Jordan a eu pour effet de restreindre \u00e9troitement ce principe. Alors que la motion avait une port\u00e9e large quant aux services dont les enfants avaient besoin, AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada en ont limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e aux conflits entre les gouvernements et aux enfants polyhandicap\u00e9s.\n[361] En revanche, AADNC est d\u2019avis que le principe de Jordan n\u2019est pas un concept concernant l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et, qu\u2019il ne fait pas partie du Programme des SEFPN. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce principe d\u00e9borde du cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. AADNC soutient \u00e9galement que le Programme des SEFPN ne vise pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les besoins sociaux qui existent dans une r\u00e9serve, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe divers autres programmes sociaux qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 ces besoins et, qui sont offerts aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. De plus, les autorisations relatives au Programme des SEFPN ne permettent pas de payer une d\u00e9pense qui serait normalement rembours\u00e9e par un autre programme (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les dispositions relatives au cumul pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 11.0 du Manuel national des programmes sociaux 2012, p. 10). En tout \u00e9tat de cause, AADNC soutient que rien ne permet de penser que sa conception du principe de Jordan a des effets pr\u00e9judiciables.\n[362] Selon le Tribunal, bien qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas \u00e0 strictement parler d\u2019un concept concernant l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, le principe de Jordan est pertinent et il est souvent indissociable de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille aux Premi\u00e8res Nations, notamment dans le cas du Programme des SEFPN. Le rapport Wen:De no 3 a express\u00e9ment recommand\u00e9 la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan selon les modalit\u00e9s suivantes, \u00e0 la page 16 :\n[traduction]\nLes conflits de comp\u00e9tence entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et entre les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces ont des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives importantes sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants indiens inscrits [\u2026] Le nombre de conflits avec lesquels les organismes sont aux prises chaque ann\u00e9e est \u00e9lev\u00e9. \u00c0 la phase 2, durant laquelle la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 explor\u00e9e plus \u00e0 fond, les 12 SEFPN vis\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9chantillon ont signal\u00e9 avoir v\u00e9cu 393 conflits de comp\u00e9tence au cours de la seule derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e. La r\u00e9solution de chaque conflit a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 environ 50,25 heures\/personne, ce qui a drain\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement les ressources d\u00e9j\u00e0 limit\u00e9es des organismes de SEFPN.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[363] Le rapport Wen:De no 2 signale que 36 % des conflits de comp\u00e9tence opposent des minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, que 27 % opposent des minist\u00e8res provinciaux et que seulement 14 % de ces conflits opposent le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et des gouvernements provinciaux (p. 44). Certains conflits ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 200 heures avant que le personnel trouve une solution : \u00ab [l]e co\u00fbt des ressources humaines pour r\u00e9soudre les conflits de comp\u00e9tence en fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un co\u00fbt extraordinaire pour les agences et ce co\u00fbt n\u2019est pas couvert par la formule \u00bb (Rapport Wen:De no 2, p. 28).\n[364] Le principe de Jordan concerne \u00e9galement le manque de coordination des services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 dans les r\u00e9serves. Autrement dit, comme Jordan, les enfants doivent d\u2019abord \u00eatre pris en charge pour pouvoir acc\u00e9der aux services dont ils ont besoin, en raison du manque de services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 dans les r\u00e9serves. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, aux pages 13 et 19 :\n4.20 Des probl\u00e8mes sociaux et de sant\u00e9 peuvent compliquer la prestation des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Nous avons constat\u00e9 que les organismes des Premi\u00e8res nations ne peuvent pas toujours compter sur d\u2019autres services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 pour les aider \u00e0 garder des familles unies ou \u00e0 offrir les services n\u00e9cessaires aux Premi\u00e8res nations. L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces services n\u2019est pas le m\u00eame dans les collectivit\u00e9s situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, et il diff\u00e8re \u00e9galement d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Le Minist\u00e8re n\u2019a pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quels autres services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 sont disponibles dans les r\u00e9serves pour appuyer les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts dans les r\u00e9serves ne peuvent pas \u00eatre comparables si les collectivit\u00e9s dans les r\u00e9serves doivent r\u00e9gler des probl\u00e8mes qui, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves, seraient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 d\u2019autres services sociaux et de sant\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\n4.40 Les enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations qui ont besoin d\u2019importants soins m\u00e9dicaux se trouvent dans une situation ambigu\u00eb. Certains enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations pris en charge n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement besoin de protection, mais requi\u00e8rent plut\u00f4t d\u2019importants soins m\u00e9dicaux qui ne sont pas offerts dans les r\u00e9serves. Le fait de prendre en charge ces enfants \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur collectivit\u00e9 leur donne acc\u00e8s aux soins m\u00e9dicaux dont ils ont besoin. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada et Sant\u00e9 Canada tentent de recueillir plus de donn\u00e9es sur le nombre d\u2019enfants dans cette situation et les co\u00fbts connexes. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada a propos\u00e9 un moyen de r\u00e9gler ces questions ainsi que d\u2019autres questions.\n[365] Le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, \u00e0 la page 18, d\u00e9plore \u00e9galement ce manque de coordination entre les programmes d\u2019AADNC et entre les programmes d\u2019AADNC et de Sant\u00e9 Canada :\n4.38 Comme la protection et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants peuvent exiger l\u2019appui d\u2019autres programmes, nous nous attendions \u00e0 ce que le Minist\u00e8re facilite la coordination entre le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations et d\u2019autres de ses programmes pertinents, et qu\u2019il facilite l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d\u2019autres programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n4.39 Nous avons constat\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences fondamentales entre le point de vue d\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada et celui de Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s respectives en mati\u00e8re de financement des services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations qui sont pris en charge. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada est d\u2019avis que les services offerts \u00e0 ces enfants avant qu\u2019ils soient pris en charge devraient continuer \u00e0 \u00eatre offerts. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Sant\u00e9 Canada croit que les enfants vivant dans les r\u00e9serves qui sont pris en charge devraient avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous les programmes et les services offerts aux enfants qui sont pris en charge dans une province, et qu\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada devrait, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, assumer la totalit\u00e9 des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la prestation de ces services. Le Minist\u00e8re affirme ne pas avoir l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de financer les services couverts par Sant\u00e9 Canada. Ces diff\u00e9rences de point de vue peuvent avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la disponibilit\u00e9, la dur\u00e9e et le niveau des services offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations. Par exemple, un organisme des Premi\u00e8res nations a d\u00fb attendre 9 mois pour obtenir une confirmation qu\u2019un appareil de 11 000 $ pour un enfant pris en charge serait pay\u00e9 par Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[366] Par exemple, une enfant de quatre ans d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation a subi un arr\u00eat cardiaque ainsi qu\u2019une l\u00e9sion c\u00e9r\u00e9brale anoxique au cours d\u2019un examen dentaire de routine. Elle est devenue totalement d\u00e9pendante dans toutes ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes. Avant de recevoir son cong\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, elle avait besoin d\u2019un \u00e9quipement m\u00e9dical complet et notamment d\u2019une poussette adapt\u00e9e, d\u2019un lit et d\u2019un matelas, d\u2019un l\u00e8ve\u2011personne et d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de rails au plafond.

Par exemple, d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019un enfant est pris en charge, le Programme des SEFPN ne peut r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer de Sant\u00e9 Canada les co\u00fbts du programme des services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s. Dans ce cas, Sant\u00e9 Canada pr\u00e9sume que les co\u00fbts sont couverts par une autre source (par le Programme des SEFPN). Toutefois, AADNC ne poss\u00e8de pas les autorisations n\u00e9cessaires pour payer des d\u00e9penses m\u00e9dicales. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il y a de la confusion quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de recevoir des soins de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. comment obtenir les formulaires o\u00f9 les envoyer et qui appeler pour obtenir des r\u00e9ponses lorsque le site internet officiel n\u2019indique pas \u00e0 qui s\u2019adresser pour obtenir des renseignements) (Lacunes dans la prestation des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la r\u00e9gion de la C\u2011B, p. 1 et 2).\n[371] Les services dentaires sont \u00e9galement un sujet litigieux pour les organismes de SEFPN et les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations. M\u00eame en cas d\u2019urgence, les soins dentaires de base sont refus\u00e9s dans le cadre du Programme des soins de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s si une autorisation pr\u00e9alable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue. Si le client insiste, Sant\u00e9 Canada lui conseille d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision, ce qui peut entra\u00eener des d\u00e9lais suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, lorsqu\u2019un enfant pris en charge est en cause, l\u2019organisme de SEFPN n\u2019a d\u2019autre choix que de payer (Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region, p. 2).\n[372] D\u2019autres d\u00e9penses m\u00e9dicales qui posent probl\u00e8me sont celles concernant les services en sant\u00e9 mentale. Le financement de Sant\u00e9 Canada pour les services en sant\u00e9 mentale ne couvre que les crises de courte dur\u00e9e, alors que les enfants pris en charge ont souvent des besoins en sant\u00e9 mentale de longue dur\u00e9e et que ces services ne sont pas toujours offerts dans les r\u00e9serves. Par cons\u00e9quent, les enfants pris en charge se voient refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services en sant\u00e9 mentale en raison des retards \u00e0 obtenir les services, du financement limit\u00e9 et des contraintes de temps impos\u00e9es \u00e0 la prestation de ce type de service. Pour empirer la situation, certains enfants, qui ne peuvent obtenir les services en sant\u00e9 mentale dont ils ont besoin, ne sont pas admissibles aux programmes scolaires destin\u00e9s aux enfants ayant des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux, qui exigent une \u00e9valuation ou un diagnostic d\u2019un psychologue (Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region, p. 2 et 3).\n[373] Dans certains cas, le Programme des SEFPN paie les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es aux services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s, m\u00eame si elles ne sont pas admissibles au sens du Programme des SEFPN (Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region, p. 2 et 3). Cette situation est probl\u00e9matique, car AADNC doit r\u00e9affecter des fonds provenant d\u2019autres programmes \u2013 qui r\u00e9pondent aux facteurs de risque sous-jacents concernant les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u2013 pour payer les frais d\u2019entretien. L\u00e0 encore, le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada souligne ce qui suit, \u00e0 la page 29 :\n4.72 \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9penses du Programme augmentent plus rapidement que son budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada a d\u00fb r\u00e9affecter les fonds attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres programmes. Dans une \u00e9tude de 2006, le Minist\u00e8re a reconnu que, au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les r\u00e9affectations budg\u00e9taires \u2014 de programmes portant notamment sur l\u2019infrastructure communautaire et le logement au profit d\u2019autres programmes comme celui de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance \u2014 ont emp\u00each\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses en mati\u00e8re de logement de suivre la croissance de la population et ont acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de l\u2019infrastructure communautaire.\n4.73 \u00c0 notre avis, la m\u00e9thode budg\u00e9taire qu\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada utilise actuellement pour ce type de programme n\u2019est pas viable. Le budget du Programme doit \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 la politique gouvernementale et permettre \u00e0 toutes les parties concern\u00e9es de s\u2019acquitter des obligations qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le cadre du Programme et en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale applicable, tout en minimisant les r\u00e9percussions sur d\u2019autres programmes importants du Minist\u00e8re. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pris des mesures pour r\u00e9gler ces questions en Alberta et il s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame dans d\u2019autres provinces, d\u2019ici 2012.\n[374] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, AADNC a lui-m\u00eame signal\u00e9 ce probl\u00e8me dans ses \u00e9valuations du Programme des SEFPN. L\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007) a identifi\u00e9 le Programme des SEFPN comme l\u2019un des cinq programmes d\u2019AADNC susceptibles d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le bien-\u00eatre des enfants, des familles et des collectivit\u00e9s. Les quatre autres programmes sont le Programme de pr\u00e9vention de la violence familiale, le Programme d\u2019aide \u00e0 la vie autonome, l\u2019Initiative d\u2019un r\u00e9investissement de la Prestation nationale pour enfants et le Programme de soutien du revenu. Selon l\u2019\u00c9valuation, \u00ab [i]l se peut qu\u2019avec une meilleure coordination, ces programmes puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re plus strat\u00e9gique pour soutenir les familles et les aider \u00e0 faire face aux probl\u00e8mes qui sont le plus souvent associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la violence envers les enfants \u00bb (\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007), p. 43). En outre, l\u2019\u00c9valuation mentionne d\u2019autres programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui contribuent directement \u00e0 la bonne sant\u00e9 des familles et des collectivit\u00e9s, offerts aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves par Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, Justice Canada et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile Canada, en plus de Sant\u00e9 Canada (\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007), p. 39 \u00e0 45). \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces informations, l\u2019\u00c9valuation du Programme des SEFPN (2007), propose, \u00e0 la page 53, trois approches pour am\u00e9liorer le Programme des SEFPN :\nApproche A : Corriger les faiblesses du mode de financement actuel des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations, tel que d\u00e9fini dans la Directive 20\u20111 du programme, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que sous sa forme actuelle, il dissuade les organismes de faire appel \u00e0 une approche ax\u00e9e sur une r\u00e9ponse diff\u00e9rentielle et favorise le placement des enfants \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du foyer.\nApproche B : En plus de corriger les faiblesses de la Directive 20\u20111 du programme, inciter les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des plans communautaires d\u00e9taill\u00e9s visant \u00e0 impliquer les autres programmes sociaux d\u2019AINC dans la pr\u00e9vention de la violence envers les enfants. Les cinq programmes sociaux d\u2019AINC (\u00e0 savoir, le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations, le Programme d\u2019aide \u00e0 la vie autonome, l\u2019Initiative de r\u00e9investissement de la Prestation nationale pour enfants, le Programme de pr\u00e9vention de la violence familiale et le Programme de soutien du revenu) visent tous les m\u00eames collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations et ont tous un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des retomb\u00e9es pour les enfants et les familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faudrait les coordonner et utiliser comme indicateur de rendement pour tous ces programmes, en vertu du nouveau cadre de rendement des programmes sociaux d\u2019AINC, le taux de violence envers les enfants au sein des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations \u00e9tablies dans les r\u00e9serves.\nApproche C : En plus des approches A et B, am\u00e9liorer la coordination des programmes sociaux d\u2019AINC avec ceux des autres minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui sont destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res nations install\u00e9es dans les r\u00e9serves comme, par exemple, les programmes de sant\u00e9 et de d\u00e9veloppement de la petite enfance. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une plus grande coordination, et en mettant davantage l\u2019accent sur les besoins des diff\u00e9rentes collectivit\u00e9s, ces programmes pourraient jouer un r\u00f4le plus important dans la pr\u00e9vention de la violence envers les enfants.\n[375] L\u2019\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Alberta, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en 2010, a, elle aussi, permis de constater que plusieurs questions de comp\u00e9tence compromettaient l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la prestation des services, notamment l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services de soutien en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9vention. En 2012, l\u2019\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse concluait : \u00ab Il faut mieux coordonner les programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux d\u2019aide aux enfants et aux parents \u00bb (p. 55). L\u2019\u00c9valuation par AADNC de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019AAAP en Saskatchewan et en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, pr\u00e9cisait ce qui suit, \u00e0 la page 55:\nDe toute \u00e9vidence, le Programme des SEFPN n\u2019est pas et ne peut pas \u00eatre cloisonn\u00e9 des autres programmes. De trop nombreux facteurs influencent le besoin global en programmes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et il serait irr\u00e9aliste de supposer que les agences peuvent fournir l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des services n\u00e9cessaires. Pour plus d\u2019efficience, AADNC pourrait avoir une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de ses programmes et des autres programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, et en faciliter la coordination. Le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, la promotion de la sant\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9ducation et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 culturelle figurent parmi les secteurs cl\u00e9s o\u00f9 une int\u00e9gration des programmes et des services pourrait contribuer \u00e0 rehausser le bien-\u00eatre communautaire d\u2019une fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois efficace et n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019obtention de r\u00e9sultats positifs \u00e0 long terme, et en bout de course pour une r\u00e9duction soutenue du nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge.\n[376] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur le principe de Jordan dans l\u2019affaire Conseil de la bande de Pictou Landing c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CF 342. Le Conseil de la bande de Pictou Landing (le CBPL) avait demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019AADNC de refuser de le rembourser les soins \u00e0 domicile prodigu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses membres. Le CBPL avait invoqu\u00e9 le principe de Jordan. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s une conf\u00e9rence de cas \u00e0 laquelle le gouvernement provincial et des repr\u00e9sentants du CBPL, d\u2019AADNC et de Sant\u00e9 Canada avaient particip\u00e9, AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de conflit de comp\u00e9tence dans cette affaire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les deux paliers de gouvernement convenaient que le financement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 d\u00e9passait ce qui serait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un enfant vivant hors r\u00e9serve.\n[377] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019AADNC faisait du principe de Jordan \u00e9tait trop \u00e9troite et, que sa conclusion selon laquelle ce principe ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable :\n[96] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il existe une politique provinciale en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assistance, qui est pr\u00e9vue par la loi, concernant la prestation de services \u00e0 domicile dans les cas exceptionnels touchant les personnes ayant des invalidit\u00e9s multiples et qui ne sont pas offerts dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[97] La Cour de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne ayant des invalidit\u00e9s multiples et vivant hors r\u00e9serve avait le droit de recevoir des services \u00e0 domicile conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses besoins. Les besoins de la personne en cause \u00e9taient exceptionnels; la SAA et ses r\u00e8glements pr\u00e9voyaient les cas exceptionnels. Pourtant, selon une politique provinciale expresse, le cas d\u2019un adolescent lourdement handicap\u00e9 vivant sur la r\u00e9serve d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation ne peut pas \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il se trouve dans une situation tr\u00e8s difficile comparable. \u00c0 mon avis, cela m\u2019oblige \u00e0 examiner le principe de Jordan qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 dans le but m\u00eame de s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des situations comme celle de Jeremy.\n[378] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada n\u2019avaient pas correctement \u00e9valu\u00e9 la demande de financement du CBPL pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019un de ses membres :\n[111] J\u2019estime que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a accept\u00e9 l\u2019obligation qui d\u00e9coule du principe de Jordan. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019arrive \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s aux m\u00eames conclusions que la Cour dans Boudreau. Les accords de contribution du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral obligeaient le CBPL \u00e0 offrir des programmes et des services conformes aux normes pr\u00e9vues par les politiques et les lois de la province. La SAA et les r\u00e8glements obligent le minist\u00e8re provincial \u00e0 fournir de l\u2019assistance et des services \u00e0 domicile conform\u00e9ment aux besoins de la personne qui exige ces services. Le CBPL l\u2019a fait. Jeremy l\u2019a fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada doivent rembourser les frais encourus par le CBPL.\n[\u2026]\n[116] Le principe de Jordan n\u2019est pas un principe \u00e0 port\u00e9e illimit\u00e9e. Il faut que les services de sant\u00e9 ou sociaux compl\u00e9mentaires soient l\u00e9galement offerts aux personnes qui vivent hors r\u00e9serve. Il exige \u00e9galement que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation des services et des co\u00fbts qui r\u00e9pondent aux besoins de l\u2019enfant d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re nation vivant dans une r\u00e9serve.\n[379] Le principe de Jordan vise \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes de comp\u00e9tence qui sont susceptibles de se traduire par un d\u00e9lai, une interruption, ou un refus d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service \u00e0 aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Les protocoles d\u2019entente de 2009 et de 2013 entra\u00eenent n\u00e9cessairement des retards, du fait qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9voient un examen des politiques et des programmes, des conf\u00e9rences de cas et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des approbations du sous-ministre adjoint avant m\u00eame qu\u2019un financement provisoire soit accord\u00e9. Il convient de souligner que la m\u00e9thode de la conf\u00e9rence de cas est l\u2019approche qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans le cas de Jordan, malheureusement sans succ\u00e8s (t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cindy Blackstock, Transcription, vol. 43, p. 104).\n[380] On ne sait pas non plus exactement pourquoi la position d\u2019AADNC est ax\u00e9e principalement sur les conflits intergouvernementaux dans les situations dans lesquelles un enfant a plusieurs handicaps et a besoin de services de divers fournisseurs. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve susmentionn\u00e9s d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019un grand nombre de conflits de comp\u00e9tence surgissent entre des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux tels qu\u2019AADNC, Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019autres. Fait significatif, le fonds de 11 millions de dollars que Sant\u00e9 Canada a constitu\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre aux cas r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9. Selon Mme Baggley, la raison de cette situation est que les cas invoqu\u00e9s ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux crit\u00e8res permettant d\u2019appliquer le principe de Jordan, ou encore qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s avant qu\u2019on ait besoin des fonds (Transcription, vol. 57, p. 123\u2011125).\n[381] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que c\u2019est en raison de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite que Sant\u00e9 Canada et AADNC font du principe de Jordan qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun cas qui r\u00e9ponde aux crit\u00e8res de ce principe. Cette interpr\u00e9tation m\u00e9connait l\u2019ampleur des probl\u00e8mes de comp\u00e9tence susceptibles de se manifester lors de la prestation de bon nombre de services f\u00e9d\u00e9raux visant \u00e0 assurer la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Cette approche va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe de Jordan et se traduit par des interruptions, des d\u00e9lais et des refus de services pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Une coordination entre l\u2019ensemble des minist\u00e8res et des programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, surtout AADNC et les programmes de Sant\u00e9 Canada, contribuerait \u00e0 \u00e9viter ces failles dans les services offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le besoin.\n[382] Mais surtout, le principe de Jordan est cens\u00e9 s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Il y a beaucoup d\u2019autres enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ne sont pas polyhandicap\u00e9s mais qui ont besoin de services, notamment de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prendre un enfant en charge pour lui permettre d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 ces services alors que les m\u00eames services sont accessibles \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des autres enfants canadiens est l\u2019une des principales raisons pour lesquelles la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nv. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conclusions\n[383] Le Programme des SEFPN, les mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes visent \u00e0 procurer des fonds destin\u00e9s \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui r\u00e9sident dans les r\u00e9serves, le biais de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ces services doivent \u00eatre conformes aux lois et aux normes provinciales ou territoriales et doivent \u00eatre fournis d\u2019une mani\u00e8re raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 ceux qui sont offerts hors des r\u00e9serves, dans des situations semblables. Toutefois, il ressort de la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e qu\u2019AADNC est loin d\u2019atteindre les objectifs vis\u00e9s et qu\u2019en fait, les Premi\u00e8res Nations sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es et dans certains cas, priv\u00e9es de services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ad\u00e9quats, par l\u2019application du Programme des SEFPN et des autres m\u00e9thodes de financement.\n[384] Dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN, la Directive 20\u20111 comporte de nombreuses lacunes et elle incite \u00e0 retirer les enfants de leur milieu familial et de leur collectivit\u00e9. Son principal d\u00e9faut est d\u2019\u00e9mettre des hypoth\u00e8ses quant aux seuils de population et au nombre d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s pour financer les budgets d\u2019exploitation des organismes de SEFPN. Ces hypoth\u00e8ses ne tiennent pas compte de la v\u00e9ritable situation qui existe en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans bon nombre des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Les budgets d\u2019exploitation sont fixes, tandis que les budgets d\u2019entretien pour la prise en charge des enfants sont remboursables au prix co\u00fbtant. Si un organisme de SEFPN ne dispose pas des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour offrir des services \u00e0 m\u00eame son budget d\u2019exploitation, la seule solution qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 lui, dans bien des cas, consiste \u00e0 ordonner le placement de l\u2019enfant pour pouvoir lui fournir les services n\u00e9cessaires. Dans les organismes de petite taille et \u00e9loign\u00e9s, les seuils de population de la Directive 20\u20111 ont pour effet de r\u00e9duire sensiblement les budgets d\u2019exploitation, en plus de nuire \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir des programmes efficaces et de r\u00e9pondre aux situations d\u2019urgence. Cetains risquent m\u00eame de devoir fermer leurs portes.\n[385] La Directive 20\u20111 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9ritablement mise \u00e0 jour depuis le milieu des ann\u00e9es 90, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 le sous-financement des organismes de SEFPN et des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. De plus, la Directive 20\u20111 n\u2019est pas conforme aux lois et aux normes provinciales qui pr\u00e9conisent la pr\u00e9vention et les mesures les moins perturbatrices pour les enfants et les familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, bon nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont priv\u00e9s d\u2019une chance \u00e9quitable de demeurer unis ou d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9unis en temps opportun. En 2008, au moment de la plainte, la vaste majorit\u00e9 des organismes de SEFPN du Canada \u00e9taient assujettis \u00e0 la Directive 20\u20111. \u00c0 la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019audience en 2014, la Directive 20\u20111 s\u2019appliquait encore \u00e0 trois provinces ainsi qu\u2019au Yukon.\n[386] AADNC a transpos\u00e9 certaines des lacunes de la Directive 20\u20111 dans l\u2019AAAP, notamment celles concernant les enfants pris en charge et les niveaux de population, ainsi que celles concernant les volets fixes de financement pour l\u2019exploitation et la pr\u00e9vention. M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait conscient de ces lacunes dans la Directive 20\u20111 \u00e0 la suite de nombreux rapports, AADNC n\u2019a pas suivi les recommandations de ces rapports et a perp\u00e9tu\u00e9 la principale lacune du Programme des SEFPN, soit l\u2019incitation \u00e0 prendre les enfants en charge - \u00e0 les retirer de leur milieu familial.\n[387] De plus, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Directive 20\u20111, l\u2019AAAP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiquement mise \u00e0 jour pour tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9volution des lois et des normes des provinces concern\u00e9es. Une fois l\u2019AAAP mise en \u0153uvre, aucun ajustement n\u2019est apport\u00e9 au financement pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation ou du co\u00fbt de la vie ou des changements apport\u00e9s aux normes de service. Aucun ajustement n\u2019est pr\u00e9vu pour faire face \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation des co\u00fbts avec le temps et pour s\u2019assurer que les sommes consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention correspondent davantage \u00e0 toute la gamme des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance offerts hors r\u00e9serve. En revanche, lorsqu\u2019AADNC finance directement les provinces, les augmentations attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019inflation ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres co\u00fbts g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sont remboursables, assurant ainsi une ad\u00e9quation plus \u00e9troite avec les normes de service de la province ou du territoire concern\u00e9.\n[388] Le Programme des SEFPN comporte une lacune flagrante au plan de la comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille offerts dans les r\u00e9serves \u00e0 ceux qui sont offerts hors r\u00e9serve. Bien que les organismes de SEFPN soient tenus de se conformer aux lois et aux normes provinciales et territoriales, les autorisations de financement du Programme des SEFPN ne sont pas accord\u00e9es en fonction des lois et des normes de services des provinces et des territoires. Elles sont plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9es sur des niveaux et des mod\u00e8les de financement qui ne sont pas conformes aux lois et aux normes applicables. Elles ne tiennent par ailleurs pas compte des besoins r\u00e9els des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations en mati\u00e8re de services, qui sont souvent plus lourds que ceux des personnes vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves. De plus, la fa\u00e7on dont les mod\u00e8les de financement et les autorisations des programmes fonctionnent emp\u00eache une comparaison efficace avec les syst\u00e8mes provinciaux. Les provinces et les territoires utilisent rarement un mod\u00e8le de financement et la mani\u00e8re dont ils g\u00e8rent les variables relatives aux co\u00fbts est souvent tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente d\u2019une province et d\u2019un territoire \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Au lieu de modifier son syst\u00e8me pour l\u2019adapter de fa\u00e7on efficace aux syst\u00e8mes des provinces et des territoires de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer une comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable, AADNC a conserv\u00e9 ses mod\u00e8les de financement et y a incorpor\u00e9 quelques variables, telles que les salaires, qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir des provinces et des territoires.\n[389] Comme la structure de financement actuelle du Programme des SEFPN n\u2019est pas adapt\u00e9e aux lois et normes provinciales et territoriales, elle cr\u00e9e souvent des probl\u00e8mes de financement pour un certain nombre de postes. Mentionnons notamment les salaires et les avantages sociaux, la formation, les ajustements pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie, les frais juridiques, les primes d\u2019assurances, les frais de d\u00e9placement, les primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, les bureaux multiples, les grandes infrastructures, les programmes et les services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture, les repr\u00e9sentants des bandes et les mesures les moins perturbatrices. Il est difficile, voire impossible, pour bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN de se conformer aux lois et aux normes provinciales et territoriales en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille s\u2019ils ne disposent pas d\u2019un financement suffisant pour ces postes. De nombreux petits organismes \u00e9loign\u00e9s, se voient m\u00eame dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de fournir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les mod\u00e8les de financement des SEFPN ne procurent pas suffisamment de fonds \u00e0 bon nombre d\u2019organismes de SEFPN pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de leur client\u00e8le. La m\u00e9thodologie de financement d\u2019AADNC contr\u00f4le leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles et d\u2019assurer qu\u2019on leur offre des services raisonnablement comparables, tant dans les r\u00e9serves qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celles\u2011ci. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de nombreux rapports et \u00e9valuations sur le Programme des SEFPN d\u00e9non\u00e7ant le fait que la norme de la \u00ab comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable \u00bb d\u2019AADNC n\u2019est pas suffisamment d\u00e9finie et mesur\u00e9e, ce probl\u00e8me n\u2019a toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\n[390] Bien que certains organismes affichent des surplus budg\u00e9taires, et malgr\u00e9 le financement suppl\u00e9mentaire et la r\u00e9affectation de fonds \u00e0 partir d\u2019autres programmes, la preuve d\u00e9montre que le financement est toujours insuffisant. Le Tribunal estime que l\u2019argument contraire d\u2019AADNC est d\u00e9raisonnable, vu la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, la r\u00e9affectation de fonds provenant d\u2019autres programmes d\u2019AANDC, tels que ceux concernant le logement et les infrastructures, pour absorber les frais d\u2019entretien du Programme des SEFPN a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019ind\u00e9fendable par la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada. En outre, elle a des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives sur d\u2019autres programmes sociaux importants dispens\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves. L\u00e0 encore, AADNC n\u2019a, en grande partie, pas donn\u00e9 suite aux recommandations de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics.\n[391] De plus, dans les secteurs o\u00f9 le Programme des SEFPN est compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par d\u2019autres programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants et des familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, on constate un manque de coordination entre les diff\u00e9rents programmes. Selon la preuve, les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral travaillent souvent en vase clos. Cette situation entra\u00eene des interruptions, des retards ou des refus de service et, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, d\u00e9favorise les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Le principe de Jordan \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me. Toutefois, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite qu\u2019en font AADNC et Sant\u00e9 Canada m\u00e9conna\u00eet un grand nombre de diff\u00e9rends qui peuvent surgir et qui devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9s en appliquant ce principe.\n[392] Bien qu\u2019elle semble constituer une am\u00e9lioration de la Directive 20\u20111 et une solution plus avantageuse que l\u2019AAAP, l\u2019application de l\u2019Entente de 1965 en Ontario a \u00e9galement entra\u00een\u00e9 des refus de service et elle a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Par exemple, comme elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps, l\u2019Entente ne tient pas compte des changements apport\u00e9s aux lois provinciales au fil des ans, notamment dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 mentale et des autres services en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9vention. Cette situation est aggrav\u00e9e par un manque de coordination entre les programmes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux en mati\u00e8re de services sociaux et de sant\u00e9 offerts aux enfants et aux familles dans le besoin, bien que ces types de programmes soient synchronis\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario. L\u2019absence de services connexes appuyant les services offerts aux enfants et aux familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, particuli\u00e8rement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es, ne fait qu\u2019amplifier cette lacune. Il y a \u00e9galement une discordance entre les lois et les normes de l\u2019Ontario en ce qui concerne la prestation de services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations par le biais de la nomination d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de bande et l\u2019insuffisance du financement accord\u00e9 par AADNC \u00e0 ce chapitre. Il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que la position d\u2019AADNC \u00e0 ce sujet soit qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas tenu de partager les co\u00fbts de services qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019Entente de 1965.\n[393] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la m\u00e9thode appliqu\u00e9e par AADNC pour procurer des fonds destin\u00e9s \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon par le biais de services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, conformes aux lois et aux normes des provinces et des territoires et fournis d\u2019une mani\u00e8re raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 ceux qui sont fournis hors des r\u00e9serves dans une situation analogue, est loin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9. En fait, la preuve d\u00e9montre que bon nombre des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s et m\u00eame, priv\u00e9s de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ad\u00e9quats, par la mani\u00e8re dont AADNC applique le Programme des SEFPN, les mod\u00e8les de financement et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes. Ces conclusions concordent avec celles de l\u2019EPN, des rapports Wen:De, des rapports de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada et du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics. Le Tribunal r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019il accepte les conclusions de ces rapports et s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur elles pour tirer ses propres conclusions. Ces conclusions sont \u00e9galement corrobor\u00e9es par les autres t\u00e9moignages et la preuve documentaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9e, et notamment par les documents internes d\u2019AADNC.\n[394] Comme nous le verrons dans la section suivante, les effets pr\u00e9judiciables d\u00e9coulant du Programme des SEFPN, des mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes perp\u00e9tuent les d\u00e9savantages historiquement subis par les Premi\u00e8res Nations.\nC. La race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique constitue un facteur ayant jou\u00e9 dans la fourniture de services ayant d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 les Premi\u00e8res Nations ou dans le refus de services\n[395] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que les Premi\u00e8res Nations poss\u00e8dent les caract\u00e9ristiques inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la race ou \u00e0 l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. Les deux motifs ont invoqu\u00e9s au soutien d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de peuples autochtones (voir, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions La Reine c. Drybones, [1970] RCS 282, Bear c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 CAF 40, Bignell-Malcolm c. Bande indienne Ebb and Flow, 2008 TCDP 3 et Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Blais, 2007 QCTDP 11).\n[396] La prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans le cadre du Programme des SEFPN et des autres ententes provinciales est destin\u00e9e explicitement aux Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve. Selon l\u2019Entente (de financement) du Yukon, les services sont destin\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes les Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant au Yukon. Autrement dit, la d\u00e9finition du public auquel les services sont offerts repose uniquement sur la race ou l\u2019origine ethnique des prestataires des services. Les Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve et au Yukon sont, prima facie, d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es ou se voient refuser des services en raison de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, dans le cadre de l\u2019application du Programme des SEFPN, des mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales.\n[397] AADNC soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que des modifications au Programme des SEFPN et aux mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants, ou aux autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes permettraient d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. En cons\u00e9quence, AADNC fait valoir que les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la question de savoir si le financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est suffisant pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un besoin per\u00e7u d\u00e9borde le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate sur la discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[398] L\u2019analyse de la discrimination prima facie ne porte pas sur les r\u00e9sultats envisag\u00e9s. Elle porte sur l\u2019existence d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables et sur la question de savoir si un motif de distinction illicite a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ces effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Les r\u00e9sultats envisag\u00e9s n\u2019entrent en jeu que lorsque la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e et qu\u2019une ordonnance du Tribunal est n\u00e9cessaire pour corriger la discrimination conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019accepte pas non plus l\u2019argument selon lequel la question de savoir si le financement est suffisant pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un besoin per\u00e7u d\u00e9borde le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate sur la discrimination en vertu de la LCDP. Cette question et la preuve s\u2019y rapportant aident \u00e0 analyser la question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit celle de savoir si les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une \u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une question concernant l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle.\ni. L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle\n[399] La LCDP vise \u00e0 donner effet au principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, soit \u00ab le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins \u00bb [\u2026] (article 2 de la LCDP, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). La jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte nous \u00e9claire sur la teneur du principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la LCDP (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien de la CAF, par. 19). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu de mani\u00e8re constante que l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement un traitement \u00e9gal pour tous. Tel qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, \u00ab un traitement identique peut fr\u00e9quemment engendrer de graves in\u00e9galit\u00e9s \u00bb (arr\u00eat Andrews, p. 164).\n[400] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vriend c. Alberta, [1998] 1 RCS 493, par. 69, \u00ab il est facile de dire que quiconque \u201cnous\u201d ressemble \u00e0 un droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 [\u2026] chacun [\u2026] trouve cependant plus difficile de soutenir que les gens \u201cdiff\u00e9rents\u201d, sous un aspect ou un autre, doivent jouir des m\u00eames droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que nous \u00bb. En d\u2019autres termes, la v\u00e9ritable \u00e9galit\u00e9 et l\u2019accommodement des diff\u00e9rences, ce qui est appel\u00e9 l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle \u00bb, exigent souvent que des distinctions soient faites (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews, aux p. 168 et 169). En effet, dans certains cas, \u00ab la discrimination peut d\u00e9couler du fait de ne pas prendre de mesures concr\u00e8tes pour faire en sorte que les groupes d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale des services offerts \u00e0 la population en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [\u2026] \u00bb (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Eldridge, par. 78).\n[401] Dans l\u2019affaire Eldridge, il s\u2019agissait de savoir si le fait de ne pas offrir des services d\u2019interpr\u00e8tes gestuels aux personnes malentendantes dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime public de soins de sant\u00e9 allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte. La Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que la discrimination d\u00e9coulait des mesures prises par des organismes subordonn\u00e9s, comme des h\u00f4pitaux, qui agissaient comme mandataires du gouvernement pour la prestation des services m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9vus dans la l\u00e9gislation. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9finit son objectif comme \u00e9tant celui de garantir l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un \u00e9ventail de services m\u00e9dicaux, la l\u00e9gislature ne peut pas se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation que lui impose le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte de fournir ces services sans discrimination en confiant aux h\u00f4pitaux la charge de r\u00e9aliser cet objectif. Le syst\u00e8me de soins de sant\u00e9 s\u2019appliquait d\u2019une mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la population de la province, mais l\u2019absence d\u2019interpr\u00e8tes emp\u00eachait les personnes malentendantes de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du syst\u00e8me dans la m\u00eame mesure que les entendants. Le texte l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9tait discriminatoire, parce qu\u2019il avait pour effet de priver une personne de la m\u00eame protection ou du m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi.\n[402] L\u2019analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a des effets r\u00e9ellement discriminatoires doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre men\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, afin de \u00ab [\u2026] tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble des contextes social, politique et juridique dans lesquels l\u2019all\u00e9gation est formul\u00e9e \u00bb (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Law c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 1 RCS 497, par. 30). Dans le cas des peuples autochtones du Canada, ce contexte englobe l\u2019h\u00e9ritage de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant du colonialisme, des d\u00e9placements de populations et du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats (voir les arr\u00eats R. c. Turpin, [1989] 1 RCS 1296, p. 1332; Corbiere c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 RCS 203, par. 66; Lovelace c. Ontario, [2000] 1 RCS 950, par. 69; R. c. Kapp, [2008] 2 RCS 483, par. 59, et R. c.

John Milloy, historien et auteur de l\u2019ouvrage A National Crime, The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (Winnipeg, University of Manitoba Press, 2006) [A National Crime]), a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert sur l\u2019histoire des pensionnats devant le Tribunal. Son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 et il est appuy\u00e9 par des documents d\u2019archives officiels, ainsi que par d\u2019autres documents mentionn\u00e9s dans son ouvrage. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re les renseignements que M. Milloy a fournis au cours de son t\u00e9moignage comme des faits.\n[407] Pendant l\u2019\u00e9poque des pensionnats indiens, les enfants autochtones ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s, souvent de force, de leurs foyers et emmen\u00e9s dans des pensionnats pour \u00eatre \u00ab civilis\u00e9s \u00bb. Dans bien des cas, les conditions de vie \u00e9taient effroyables et ont engendr\u00e9 la maladie, la faim, l\u2019angoisse et le d\u00e9sespoir. Tr\u00e8s souvent, les enfants avaient froid, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre surcharg\u00e9s de travail et humili\u00e9s. De plus, ils ne pouvaient parler leur langue maternelle, de crainte d\u2019\u00eatre punis s\u00e9v\u00e8rement, certaines sanctions allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019insertion d\u2019une aiguille dans la langue. De nombreux enfants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de violence verbale ou encore d\u2019agressions physiques ou sexuelles. Dans certains cas, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de manger leurs propres vomissures. Des enfants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enferm\u00e9s dans des placards, des cages ou des sous-sols. D\u2019autres ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019enfuir, mais quelques-uns l\u2019ont fait pendant l\u2019hiver et sont morts de froid. De nombreux enfants se sont suicid\u00e9s apr\u00e8s avoir fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un pensionnat.\n[408] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un grand nombre d\u2019enfants autochtones plac\u00e9s sous la surveillance du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode de leur \u00ab prise en charge \u00bb (voir l\u2019ouvrage A National Crime, p. 51). Une bonne partie de ceux qui ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 survivre malgr\u00e9 tout sont marqu\u00e9s \u00e0 vie. M. Milloy a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats a eu des r\u00e9percussions, non seulement sur les personnes, mais aussi sur l\u2019ensemble des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations. La prise en charge de plusieurs g\u00e9n\u00e9rations d\u2019enfants dans le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens a mis en p\u00e9ril la culture, la langue et la survie m\u00eame de nombreuses collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[409] L\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 Robert Joseph, de la collectivit\u00e9 Kwakwaka\u2019wakw, a donn\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage personnel d\u00e9taill\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9mouvant de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019il a v\u00e9cue dans le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, la violence, les fouilles \u00e0 nu, la confiscation de cadeaux, l\u2019interdiction de recevoir la visite des membres de la famille et l\u2019humiliation publique \u00e9taient monnaie courante. \u00c0 son avis, dans certains cas, les fouilles \u00e0 nu \u00e9taient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des agressions sexuelles camoufl\u00e9es. Il a lui-m\u00eame subi, \u00e0 titre de punition, une fouille \u00e0 nu devant la division des gar\u00e7ons de l\u2019\u00e9cole et s\u2019est fait dire de se pencher. L\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 Joseph a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 d\u2019enfants enferm\u00e9s dans des placards et des cages ainsi que de la pr\u00e9valence de remarques racistes.\n[410] L\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 Joseph a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un profond sentiment de solitude par suite de son exp\u00e9rience et s\u2019est tourn\u00e9 vers l\u2019alcool pour lutter contre le d\u00e9sespoir. Il s\u2019est repris en mains depuis et s\u2019active aujourd\u2019hui pour la promotion des d\u00e9marches de r\u00e9conciliation et de gu\u00e9rison pour les Autochtones.\n[411] Le gouvernement du Canada a reconnu les s\u00e9quelles et les cons\u00e9quences du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens. Dans des excuses pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en 2008 aux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des pensionnats indiens (voir l\u2019annexe, pi\u00e8ce 52), l\u2019ancien premier ministre Stephen Harper s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 comme suit :\nLe traitement des enfants dans ces pensionnats est un triste chapitre de notre histoire.\nPendant plus d'un si\u00e8cle, les pensionnats indiens ont s\u00e9par\u00e9 plus de 150 000 enfants autochtones de leurs familles et de leurs communaut\u00e9s. Dans les ann\u00e9es 1870, en partie afin de remplir son obligation d'instruire les enfants autochtones, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer un r\u00f4le dans l'\u00e9tablissement et l'administration de ces \u00e9coles. Le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens avait deux principaux objectifs : isoler les enfants et les soustraire \u00e0 l'influence de leurs foyers, de leurs familles, de leurs traditions et de leur culture, et les int\u00e9grer par l'assimilation dans la culture dominante. Ces objectifs reposaient sur l'hypoth\u00e8se que les cultures et les croyances spirituelles des Autochtones \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieures. D'ailleurs, certains cherchaient, selon une expression devenue tristement c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, \u00ab \u00e0 tuer l'Indien au sein de l'enfant \u00bb.\n[\u2026]\nLe gouvernement reconna\u00eet aujourd'hui que les cons\u00e9quences de la politique sur les pensionnats indiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s n\u00e9fastes et que cette politique a caus\u00e9 des dommages durables \u00e0 la culture, au patrimoine et \u00e0 la langue autochtones. Bien que certains anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves aient dit avoir v\u00e9cu une exp\u00e9rience positive dans ces pensionnats, leur histoire est de loin assombrie par les t\u00e9moignages tragiques sur la n\u00e9gligence et l'abus \u00e9motifs, physiques et sexuels d'enfants sans d\u00e9fense et de leur s\u00e9paration de familles et de communaut\u00e9s impuissantes.\nL'h\u00e9ritage laiss\u00e9 par les pensionnats indiens a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes sociaux qui persistent dans de nombreuses communaut\u00e9s aujourd'hui.\n[\u2026]\nAux quelque 80 000 anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves toujours en vie, ainsi qu'aux membres de leurs familles et \u00e0 leurs communaut\u00e9s, le gouvernement du Canada admet aujourd'hui qu'il a eu tort d'arracher les enfants \u00e0 leurs foyers et s'excuse d'avoir agi ainsi. Nous reconnaissons maintenant que nous avons eu tort de s\u00e9parer les enfants de leur culture et de leurs traditions riches et vivantes, cr\u00e9ant ainsi un vide dans tant de vies et de communaut\u00e9s, et nous nous excusons d'avoir agi ainsi. Nous reconnaissons maintenant qu'en s\u00e9parant les enfants de leurs familles, nous avons r\u00e9duit la capacit\u00e9 de nombreux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 \u00e9lever ad\u00e9quatement leurs propres enfants et avons scell\u00e9 le sort des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures, et nous nous excusons d'avoir agi ainsi. Nous reconnaissons maintenant que, beaucoup trop souvent, ces institutions donnaient lieu \u00e0 des cas de s\u00e9vices ou de n\u00e9gligence et n'\u00e9taient pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate, et nous nous excusons de ne pas avoir su vous prot\u00e9ger. Non seulement vous avez subi ces mauvais traitements pendant votre enfance, mais, en tant que parents, vous \u00e9tiez impuissants \u00e0 \u00e9viter le m\u00eame sort \u00e0 vos enfants, et nous le regrettons.\nLe fardeau de cette exp\u00e9rience p\u00e8se sur vos \u00e9paules depuis beaucoup trop longtemps. Ce fardeau nous revient directement, en tant que gouvernement et en tant que pays. Il n'y a pas de place au Canada pour les attitudes qui ont inspir\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de pensionnats indiens, pour qu'elles puissent pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 nouveau. Vous tentez de vous remettre de cette \u00e9preuve depuis longtemps, et d'une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8te, nous vous rejoignons maintenant dans ce cheminement. Le gouvernement du Canada pr\u00e9sente ses excuses les plus sinc\u00e8res aux peuples autochtones du Canada pour avoir si profond\u00e9ment manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir envers eux, et leur demande pardon.\n[412] Dans un esprit de r\u00e9conciliation, le Tribunal reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement les souffrances inflig\u00e9es par les pensionnats indiens. Les traumatismes individuels et collectifs inflig\u00e9s aux Autochtones par le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats, ancr\u00e9 dans des attitudes racistes et n\u00e9ocolonialistes, repr\u00e9sentent l\u2019un des aspects les plus sombres de l\u2019histoire canadienne. Ainsi que le Tribunal l\u2019explique dans la section suivante, les effets de ce syst\u00e8me continuent \u00e0 se faire sentir aujourd\u2019hui chez les enfants, les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\nb. Int\u00e9gration des pensionnats indiens dans les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance\n[413] Le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats a fonctionn\u00e9 comme \u00ab syst\u00e8me scolaire \u00bb \u00e0 compter des ann\u00e9es 1880 jusqu\u2019aux ann\u00e9es 1960, lorsqu\u2019il est devenu un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Vers 1969, l\u2019\u00c9glise s\u2019est retir\u00e9e du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a repris seul la gestion des \u00e9tablissements. Cette \u00e9poque a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de nouveaux r\u00e8glements dans lesquels le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les personnes pouvant fr\u00e9quenter les pensionnats indiens, en mettant l\u2019accent sur les orphelins et sur les enfants \u00ab n\u00e9glig\u00e9s \u00bb. De nombreux pensionnats indiens ont vu leur r\u00f4le principal passer d\u2019un r\u00f4le \u00e9ducatif \u00e0 un r\u00f4le ax\u00e9 sur l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Malgr\u00e9 ce changement, bon nombre d\u2019enfants n\u2019\u00e9taient pas renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison, parce que leurs parents \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des personnes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en mesure de prendre soin de leurs enfants (voir l\u2019ouvrage A National Crime, aux p. 211 et 212, et le t\u00e9moignage de M. Milloy, Transcription, vol. 34, aux p. 19 et 20).\n[414] Au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de 50 ans, soit des ann\u00e9es 1930 jusqu\u2019aux ann\u00e9es 1980, le nombre de pensionnats a diminu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, passant de 78 en 1930 \u00e0 12 en 1980. Le dernier pensionnat a ferm\u00e9 ses portes en 1986. Le Programme des SEFPN a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre en 1990.\nc. Traumatisme interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel caus\u00e9 par les pensionnats indiens\n[415] Dre Amy Bombay, titulaire d\u2019un doctorat en neurosciences et d\u2019une ma\u00eetrise \u00e8s sciences en psychologie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte devant le Tribunal en ce qui concerne les effets psychologiques du stress et du traumatisme et leurs r\u00e9percussions sur le bien-\u00eatre. Elle a parl\u00e9 de la transmission interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnelle du traumatisme aux descendants des survivants des pensionnats indiens. Le Tribunal estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Dre Bombay est fiable et tr\u00e8s pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car il permet de comprendre les r\u00e9percussions des traumatismes individuels et collectifs v\u00e9cus par les peuples autochtones.\n[416] Dre Bombay a expliqu\u00e9 le r\u00f4le des pensionnats indiens dans le contexte de l\u2019ensemble des traumatismes auxquels les Autochtones ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] pour les groupes autochtones du Canada et d\u2019ailleurs, le colonialisme est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de nombreux traumatismes collectifs [\u2026], notamment les traumatismes caus\u00e9s par les conqu\u00eates militaires, les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies et les d\u00e9placements forc\u00e9s.\nLe syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens n\u2019est donc qu\u2019un exemple de traumatisme collectif qui fait partie de l\u2019ensemble des traumatismes auxquels les Autochtones ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s.\n(Transcription, vol. 40, p. 94)\n[417] Selon Dre Bombay, ces traumatismes collectifs ont eu un effet cumulatif au fil des ans, notamment sur la sant\u00e9 des personnes et des collectivit\u00e9s (voir la Transcription, vol. 40, p. 83). Ainsi que ce t\u00e9moin l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, [traduction] \u00ab ces effets collectifs sont plus importants que la somme des effets individuels \u00bb (Transcription, vol. 40, p. 82). Des effets semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9s chez d\u2019autres populations et d\u2019autres groupes qui ont subi des traumatismes collectifs similaires, comme les survivants de l\u2019Holocauste, les Nippo-Am\u00e9ricains intern\u00e9s pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et les survivants du g\u00e9nocide des Arm\u00e9niens par les Turcs (Transcription, vol. 40, aux p. 111 et 112). Pour \u00e9valuer et d\u00e9crire le fait que certains groupes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi expos\u00e9s en permanence \u00e0 des traumatismes collectifs, Docteure Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart, de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Nouveau-Mexique, a utilis\u00e9 l\u2019expression \u00ab traumatisme historique \u00bb, qui est d\u00e9fini comme [traduction] \u00ab la blessure affective et psychologique r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, transmise d\u2019une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019autre par suite d\u2019un traumatisme collectif massif \u00bb (voir le t\u00e9moignage de Dre Bombay, Transcription, vol. 40, aux p. 94 et 95).\n[418] De l\u2019avis de Dre Bombay, les survivants des pensionnats indiens sont plus susceptibles de souffrir de diff\u00e9rents probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 physique et mentale que les adultes autochtones qui n\u2019ont pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 ces \u00e9tablissements. Ainsi, les survivants des pensionnats indiens pr\u00e9sentent des niveaux de d\u00e9tresse psychologique plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que les Autochtones qui n\u2019ont pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 les pensionnats. Ils risquent davantage de recevoir un diagnostic de maladie physique chronique (voir la Transcription, vol. 40, aux p. 109 et 110).\n[419] Dre Bombay a expliqu\u00e9 comme suit quelques-unes des s\u00e9quelles interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnelles des pensionnats indiens en ce qui a trait aux r\u00e9percussions sur la vie sociale:\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] de nombreuses recherches qualitatives ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de mod\u00e8les parentaux traditionnels dans les pensionnats indiens a frein\u00e9 la transmission de pratiques d\u2019\u00e9ducation traditionnelles positives que les enfants auraient autrement apprises de leurs parents. La n\u00e9gligence, les abus et les mauvais traitements observ\u00e9s ou subis par les enfants de la part de nombreuses personnes \u00e0 qui ils \u00e9taient confi\u00e9s - la mani\u00e8re dont ils traitaient les enfants, a eu pour cons\u00e9quence d\u2019inculquer de nombreuses pratiques parentales n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 ces derniers, car ces personnes \u00e9taient les seuls mod\u00e8les parentaux que les enfants avaient sous les yeux.\n(Transcription, vol. 40, p. 110)\n[420] Sur le plan g\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel, les s\u00e9quelles susmentionn\u00e9es ont pu \u00eatre transmises par les survivants des pensionnats \u00e0 leurs enfants, puis \u00e0 leurs petits-enfants. Se fondant sur l\u2019Enqu\u00eate r\u00e9gionale sur la sant\u00e9 de 2002-2003, Dre Bombay a soulign\u00e9 que 43 % des adultes des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve croyaient que le fait que leurs parents avaient fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un pensionnat indien avait eu une influence n\u00e9gative sur le r\u00f4le qu\u2019ils avaient jou\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d\u2019eux pendant leur enfance. De plus, 73,4% croyaient que le fait que leurs grands-parents avaient fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un pensionnat indien avait eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur la mani\u00e8re dont ils s\u2019\u00e9taient occup\u00e9s de leurs parents. 37,2 % des adultes des Premi\u00e8res Nations dont les parents avaient fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un pensionnat indien avaient envisag\u00e9 le suicide, comparativement \u00e0 25,7 %, chez les adultes dont les parents n\u2019avaient pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 de tels \u00e9tablissements. Enfin, le risque de suicide \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 chez les petits-enfants des survivants, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que 28,4 % d\u2019entre eux avaient tent\u00e9 de se suicider, alors que ce pourcentage \u00e9tait de 13,1 % chez les personnes dont les grands-parents n\u2019avaient pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 de pensionnat (Transcription, vol. 40, p. 110, 111, 114 et 115).\n[421] Lors d\u2019une vaste recherche qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9cemment men\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer la sant\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve, Dre Bombay a constat\u00e9 que les enfants des survivants des pensionnats indiens avaient v\u00e9cu davantage d\u2019exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives durant l\u2019enfance et de plus grands traumatismes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge adulte. Ces facteurs semblaient avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la manifestation de sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression plus importants chez les descendants des survivants des pensionnats indiens (voir l\u2019annexe, pi\u00e8ce 53, p. 373; voir \u00e9galement la Transcription, vol. 40, aux p. 69 et 71).\n[422] Le t\u00e9moignage de Dre Bombay permet de comprendre les besoins des peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il montre que ces besoins sont plus grands pour les Autochtones qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves. En mettant l\u2019accent sur la prise en charge des enfants, le Programme des SEFPN, les mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes perp\u00e9tuent les dommages caus\u00e9s par les pensionnats indiens plut\u00f4t que de tenter d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier. L\u2019histoire du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens et le traumatisme interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel qu\u2019il a engendr\u00e9 s\u2019ajoutent aux autres facteurs de risque qui touchent les enfants et familles autochtones, comme la pauvret\u00e9 et les infrastructures m\u00e9diocres, et montre bien que les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations ont davantage besoin de recevoir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ad\u00e9quats, incluant les mesures les moins perturbatrices et, surtout, des services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles.\n[423] AADNC soutient qu\u2019en d\u00e9terminant les services \u00e0 offrir et la mani\u00e8re de les fournir, les organismes de SEFPN d\u00e9terminent ce qui est \u00ab adapt\u00e9 aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles \u00bb de leur collectivit\u00e9. La d\u00e9finition de ce qui est adapt\u00e9 aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles d\u00e9pend de la culture sp\u00e9cifique de chaque Premi\u00e8re Nation. Selon AADNC, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de la laisser \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des organismes de SEFPN ou des dirigeants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[424] Toutefois, dans le Rapport de 2008 de la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada, la V\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u00e9clarait que \u00ab [p]our que le Programme soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la politique, nous nous attendions \u00e0 ce que le Minist\u00e8re sache au moins ce que l'on entend par \u201cservices adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles\u201d \u00bb (par. 4.18, pp. 12-13). Autrement dit, AADNC n\u2019avait aucune garantie que le Programme des SEFPN financerait des services de protection de l\u2019enfance adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles. En r\u00e9ponse, AADNC a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un principe directeur afin d\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019il entend par des services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles :\n[\u2026] le gouvernement du Canada fournit un financement, dans le cadre de la politique sociale, pour appuyer la prestation de services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l'enfance adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles aupr\u00e8s des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations qui reconnaissent et respectent les valeurs, les croyances et les circonstances culturelles uniques des collectivit\u00e9s desservies. Comme tels, les services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles favorisent les activit\u00e9s telles que les options de prise en charge par la famille o\u00f9 un enfant est plac\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d'un membre de la famille \u00e9largie pour que l'identit\u00e9 culturelle et les traditions puissent \u00eatre maintenues.\n(R\u00e9ponse d\u2019AADNC au Rapport de 2009 du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[425] Cependant, malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9cisions apport\u00e9es par ce principe directeur, si le financement se limite \u00e0 la prestation de ces services, le principe perd tout son sens. Un exemple frappant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard r\u00e9side dans le refus de financer les activit\u00e9s des repr\u00e9sentants des bandes indiennes aux termes de l\u2019Entente de 1965. Il en va de m\u00eame des hypoth\u00e8ses int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans la Directive 20-1 et dans l\u2019AAAP. Si le financement ne correspond pas aux besoins r\u00e9els d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 autochtone donn\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, comment celle-ci peut-elle fournir des services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles? Si le financement n\u2019est pas r\u00e9aliste, comment certaines collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations peuvent-elles corriger les s\u00e9quelles des pensionnats indiens? Il sera difficile, sinon impossible, de le faire, de sorte qu\u2019un plus grand nombre d\u2019enfants seront finalement pris en charge, ce qui perp\u00e9tuera le cycle de contr\u00f4le que des forces ext\u00e9rieures ont exerc\u00e9 sur la culture et l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtones.\n[426] Aujourd\u2019hui, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des pensionnats, c\u2019est encore le gouvernement qui d\u00e9termine le sort et l\u2019avenir d\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, que ce soit par l\u2019application de mod\u00e8les de financement restrictifs et inad\u00e9quats ou par le biais d\u2019ententes bilat\u00e9rales avec les provinces. La prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille par une Premi\u00e8re Nation et sa participation par le biais d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de bande ont pour but d\u2019assurer que les services soient adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles et correspondent aux besoins de la collectivit\u00e9. Si ce r\u00e9sultat est atteint, les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille deviendront peut-\u00eatre plus l\u00e9gitimes aux yeux de la collectivit\u00e9, ce qui en accro\u00eetra l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et pourrait, en fin de compte, aider les personnes, les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s durement \u00e9prouv\u00e9es par le syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens et d\u2019autres traumatismes historiques \u00e0 se reconstruire.\n[427] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il convient de rappeler qu\u2019une relation fiduciaire existe entre les peuples autochtones et le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, qui s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 assurer un meilleur avenir aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations par le biais de de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle il faut en faire davantage pour que la prestation de ces services dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de ces collectivit\u00e9s et, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Cette obligation va \u00e9galement de pair avec les engagements internationaux du Canada reconnaissant le statut sp\u00e9cial des enfants et des peuples autochtones.\niii. Engagements internationaux du Canada envers les enfants et les peuples autochtones\n[428] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Amnistie internationale a obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e afin d\u2019aider le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre la pertinence des obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dans l\u2019analyse de la plainte. Amnistie internationale soutient que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application de la LCDP, en particulier l\u2019article 5, doivent respecter les obligations internationales du Canada telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans diff\u00e9rents instruments internationaux des Nations Unies. Elle cite notamment la Convention relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant, le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, le Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, la Convention sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination, la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme et la D\u00e9claration sur les droits des peuples autochtones.\n[429] Amnistie internationale invoque \u00e9galement les opinions d\u2019organismes de suivi de la mise en \u0153uvre des trait\u00e9s, comme le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019homme des Nations Unies (CDHNU), le Comit\u00e9 des droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels (CDESC), le Comit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination raciale (CEDR) et le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019enfant. Elle se fonde sur ces opinions pour faire valoir que lorsqu\u2019un traitement donn\u00e9 fait une distinction fond\u00e9e tant sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtone que sur la r\u00e9sidence, il donne lieu \u00e0 de multiples violations de l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination, norme imp\u00e9rative du droit international. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, Amnistie internationale invoque les recommandations de ces organismes selon lesquelles il est imp\u00e9ratif d\u2019accorder une attention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination envers les enfants.\n[430] De l\u2019avis d\u2019AADNC, les concepts et arguments du droit international qu\u2019invoque Amnistie internationale n\u2019aident pas le Tribunal \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la LCDP et \u00e0 l\u2019appliquer aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Selon AADNC, Amnistie internationale cherche plut\u00f4t \u00e0 faire valoir que le gouvernement du Canada ne respecte pas ses obligations internationales, all\u00e9gation qui d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[431] Les trait\u00e9s internationaux doivent \u00eatre mis en \u0153uvre au moyen d\u2019une loi nationale pour faire partie du droit canadien, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne codifient des normes du droit international coutumier qui existent d\u00e9j\u00e0 en droit canadien. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019un pays devient partie \u00e0 un trait\u00e9 ou \u00e0 un pacte, il indique clairement qu\u2019il adh\u00e8re au contenu de cet instrument et qu\u2019il s\u2019engage \u00e0 en mettre les principes en \u0153uvre dans sa l\u00e9gislation nationale. Cet engagement public est solennel et contraignant en droit international. Il constitue, de la part du pays, une d\u00e9claration que sa l\u00e9gislation nationale traduira ses engagements internationaux. En cons\u00e9quence, le droit international demeure pertinent pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e et du contenu des r\u00e8gles canadiennes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ainsi que l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada depuis le jugement dissident du juge en chef Dickson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 RCS 313.\n[432] Selon le principe de base, qui ne s\u2019applique pas uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte, \u00ab il faut pr\u00e9sumer, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que la Charte accorde une protection \u00e0 tout le moins aussi grande que celle qu\u2019offrent les dispositions similaires des instruments internationaux que le Canada a ratifi\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00bb (Slaight Communications Inc. c. Davidson, [1989] 1 RCS 1038, p. 1056). Il en est ainsi parce que le l\u00e9gislateur et les assembl\u00e9es l\u00e9gislatives provinciales sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s respecter les principes du droit international (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, par. 81).\n[433] Cette approche conduit souvent la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 examiner les d\u00e9cisions et les recommandations des organismes charg\u00e9s des droits de la personne pour interpr\u00e9ter la port\u00e9e et le contenu des dispositions du droit interne \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du droit international (voir, par exemple, les arr\u00eats Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 RCS 892, p. 920; B. (R.) c. Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, [1995] 1 RCS 315, aux p. 149 et 150; Divito c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 47, aux par. 26 et 27, et Saskatchewan Federation of Labour c. Saskatchewan, 2015 CSC 4, aux par. 154 \u00e0 160).\n[434] Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est montr\u00e9e dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9largir la pertinence du droit international et \u00e0 donner effet au r\u00f4le et aux actes du Canada dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration des normes de droit international, particuli\u00e8rement dans le domaine des droits de la personne (voir les arr\u00eats \u00c9tats-Unis c. Burns, 2001 CSC 7, par. 81 [Burns], et Canada (Justice) c. Khadr, 2008 CSC 28, aux par. 2 et 3). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Burns, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 que le Canada pr\u00e9conisait l\u2019abolition de la peine de mort et qu\u2019il participait \u00e0 plusieurs initiatives multilat\u00e9rales visant \u00e0 modifier les accords en mati\u00e8re d\u2019extradition dans le cas de personnes susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre condamn\u00e9es \u00e0 la peine de mort. Selon la Cour, ces actions emp\u00eachent le Canada d\u2019extrader aux \u00c9tats-Unis une personne passible de cette peine sans obtenir l\u2019assurance pr\u00e9alable qu\u2019elle ne serait pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. Le m\u00eame raisonnement s\u2019applique dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Canada a exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle internationale ses opinions sur l\u2019importance des droits de la personne.\n[435] En effet, depuis la cr\u00e9ation des Nations Unies (l\u2019ONU), le Canada a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 la promotion des droits de la personne sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale. Ce r\u00f4le a d\u00e9but\u00e9 avec la participation du directeur canadien de la Division des droits de l\u2019homme du Secr\u00e9tariat de l\u2019ONU, M. John Humphrey, \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9bauche de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme (la D\u00e9claration universelle), en 1947. Aujourd\u2019hui, le Canada continue de se d\u00e9crire comme un ardent d\u00e9fenseur des droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle internationale.\n[436] Les obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la non-discrimination d\u00e9coulent de plusieurs instruments juridiques. Des similitudes peuvent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es dans le libell\u00e9 des instruments nationaux et internationaux sur les droits de la personne, ainsi que dans la port\u00e9e et le contenu de leurs dispositions. Le lien \u00e9troit entre le droit canadien et le droit international en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ressort \u00e9galement dans les rapports p\u00e9riodiques que le Canada pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents organismes internationaux de surveillance des trait\u00e9s sur les mesures prises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale pour donner effet aux obligations d\u00e9coulant des trait\u00e9s, ainsi que dans les recommandations que ces organismes adressent au Canada.\n[437] Les d\u00e9veloppements nationaux dans le domaine des droits de la personne ont suivi l\u2019\u00e9volution de la D\u00e9claration universelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle internationale. L\u2019article 2 de cette D\u00e9claration, que l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations Unies a adopt\u00e9e au moyen de la r\u00e9solution 217A \u00e0 sa troisi\u00e8me session, \u00e0 Paris le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1948, \u00e9nonce le principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de la non-discrimination dans l\u2019exercice des droits de l\u2019homme. L\u2019article 7 proclame l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi et le droit \u00e0 une \u00e9gale protection de la loi. Tel qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, ces principes d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 sont aujourd\u2019hui codifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte et \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019objet de la LCDP.\n[438] \u00c0 l\u2019origine, la D\u00e9claration universelle devait servir de guide pour les gouvernements dans le cadre de leurs d\u00e9marches pour garantir les droits de la personne au plan national. Elle visait \u00e9galement \u00e0 \u00e9noncer des principes qui seraient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans une convention juridiquement contraignante. C\u2019est ce qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de deux pactes et de deux protocoles facultatifs qui, avec la D\u00e9claration universelle, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme formant la Charte internationale des droits de l\u2019homme.\n[439] Le premier de ces deux pactes est le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, 999 R.T.N.U. 171 (le PIRDCP), entr\u00e9 en vigueur pour le Canada le 19 ao\u00fbt 1976. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, le Canada a reconnu la comp\u00e9tence du CDHNU pour instruire les plaintes individuelles, en ratifiant le Protocole facultatif se rapportant au Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, 999 R.T.N.U. 302. Les articles 2 et 26 du PIRDCP garantissent l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et interdisent la discrimination en des termes semblables \u00e0 ceux de la D\u00e9claration universelle.\n[440] Le CDHNU a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le sens du mot \u00ab discrimination \u00bb utilis\u00e9 dans le PIRDCP dans l\u2019Observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale 18, adopt\u00e9 lors de sa trente-septi\u00e8me session, le 10 novembre 1999, au par. 7. Il doit \u00eatre compris comme s\u2019entendant\nde toute distinction, exclusion, restriction ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence fond\u00e9e notamment sur la race, la couleur, le sexe, la langue, la religion, les opinions politiques ou autres, l\u2019origine nationale ou sociale, la fortune, la naissance ou toute autre situation, et ayant pour effet ou pour but de compromettre ou de d\u00e9truire la reconnaissance, la jouissance, ou l\u2019exercice par tous, dans des conditions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, de l\u2019ensemble des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales.\nLe CDHNU a ensuite affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019objet de la protection est l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et que les \u00c9tats pourraient \u00eatre tenus de prendre des mesures pr\u00e9cises afin d\u2019assurer cette protection (voir les par. 5, 8, 12 et 13).\n[441] Le second des deux pactes d\u00e9coulant directement de la D\u00e9claration universelle est le Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, 993 R.T.N.U. 3 (le PIDESC), entr\u00e9 en vigueur pour le Canada le 19 ao\u00fbt 1976. Le paragraphe 2(2) garantit l\u2019exercice des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s sans discrimination, tandis que l\u2019article 10 pr\u00e9voit que des mesures de protection et d\u2019assistance doivent \u00eatre prises en faveur de tous les enfants et adolescents, sans discrimination aucune pour des raisons de filiation ou autres.\n[442] Le PIDESC est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un instrument d\u2019application progressive. Toutefois, dans l\u2019Observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u00b0 20, le 2 juillet 2009 (E\/C.12\/GC\/20), le Comit\u00e9 des droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels (CDESC) a affirm\u00e9 que, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur importance, les principes d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de non-discrimination doivent recevoir une application imm\u00e9diate, malgr\u00e9 les dispositions de l\u2019article 2 du PIDESC (voir les par. 5 et 7). Le CDESC a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le PIDESC vise \u00e0 garantir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle en portant \u00ab \u2026une attention suffisante aux groupes de population qui sont en butte \u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s h\u00e9rit\u00e9s de l\u2019histoire ou tenaces, plut\u00f4t que de simplement se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au traitement formel des individus dont la situation est comparable \u00bb (par. 8; voir \u00e9galement les par. 9 et 10). Le CDESC a ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019exercice des droits vis\u00e9s par le Pacte ne doit pas \u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 au lieu de r\u00e9sidence d\u2019une personne (par. 34).\n[443] Dans un rapport qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au CDESC afin d\u2019exposer les principales mesures prises pour favoriser la mise en \u0153uvre du PIDESC, au cours de la p\u00e9riode allant de janvier 2005 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2009, le Canada a mentionn\u00e9 le Programme des SEFPN. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]e programme assure un environnement plus stable et plus s\u00e9curitaire ainsi qu\u2019un meilleur avenir aux enfants autochtones vivant normalement dans une r\u00e9serve (voir le Sixi\u00e8me rapport du Canada sur le Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels des Nations Unies (ministre des Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux, 2013), par. 103). Le Canada a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait entrepris \u00ab d\u2019appliquer au Programme des SEFPN un mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9vention \u00bb, l\u2019AAAP, \u00ab [\u2026] dans une province et un territoire \u00e0 la fois, de concert avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et les partenaires provinciaux et territoriaux \u00bb afin d\u2019assurer \u00ab la mise en place de l\u2019 [AAAP] d\u2019ici 2013 \u00bb (par. 105 et 106). Bien que le gouvernement du Canada ait pris cet engagement, la preuve montre clairement que cet objectif n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint.\n[444] En plus d\u2019\u00eatre partie aux pactes qui prot\u00e8gent les droits de la personne de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Canada est partie \u00e0 des instruments juridiques qui mettent l\u2019accent sur des sujets pr\u00e9cis ou qui visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger des groupes de personnes pr\u00e9cis. Ainsi, le Canada est partie \u00e0 la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale, 660 R.T.N.U. 195 (la CIEDR), ratifi\u00e9e en 1970. La CIEDR clarifie l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la D\u00e9claration universelle, \u00e0 laquelle elle renvoie dans son pr\u00e9ambule. Les articles 1 et 2 d\u00e9finissent la discrimination raciale et enjoignent aux \u00c9tats de prendre toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00ab assurer comme il convient le d\u00e9veloppement ou la protection de certains groupes raciaux ou d\u2019individus appartenant \u00e0 ces groupes en vue de leur garantir, dans des conditions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, le plein exercice des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales \u00bb, y compris des mesures sp\u00e9ciales, si les circonstances l\u2019exigent. L\u2019article 5 pr\u00e9cise la port\u00e9e de l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination dans la jouissance de certains droits, notamment le droit \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, aux soins m\u00e9dicaux, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale et aux services sociaux.\n[445] L\u2019organisme de surveillance de la CIEDR, le Comit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination raciale (CEDR), a comment\u00e9 le sens et la port\u00e9e des mesures sp\u00e9ciales au sens de la CIEDR. Il partage l\u2019approche des tribunaux canadiens quant au sens de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle (voir la Recommandation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale XXXII du CEDR, 24 septembre 2009 (CERD\/C\/GC\/32), par. 8). De plus, il a reconnu que les \u00ab mesures sp\u00e9ciales \u00bb pouvant \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de fait comprennent \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des instruments l\u00e9gislatifs, ex\u00e9cutifs, administratifs, budg\u00e9taires et r\u00e9glementaires, \u00e0 tous les niveaux de l\u2019appareil de l\u2019\u00c9tat [\u2026] \u00bb (par. 13).\n[446] En 2011, le Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un rapport au CEDR sur les mesures prises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale pour mettre en \u0153uvre la CIEDR. Le CEDR a \u00e9mis plusieurs recommandations, dont la suivante : \u00ab [m]ettre fin au retrait d\u2019enfants autochtones de leur famille et fournir des services de prise en charge aux familles et aux enfants dans les r\u00e9serves dot\u00e9es d\u2019un financement suffisant \u00bb [voir le document Examen des rapports pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les \u00c9tats parties conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 9 de la Convention, Observations finales du Comit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination raciale, 9 mars 2012 (CERD\/C\/CAN\/CO\/19-20), \u00e0 l\u2019al. 19f)].\n[447] M\u00eame si AADNC soutient que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral se contente de financer les services de protection de l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves dans le cadre de ses politiques sociales, les mesures budg\u00e9taires constituent, en elles-m\u00eames, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important des mesures \u00e0 prendre pour atteindre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Lorsqu\u2019elle est lue de concert avec l\u2019avis que le CEDR a exprim\u00e9 dans la Recommandation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale XXXII, la recommandation du CEDR montre que celui-ci consid\u00e8re le financement insuffisant des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves comme un obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations dans le cadre de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[448] Un autre instrument international important visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger un groupe de personnes pr\u00e9cis, et qui est pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, est la Convention relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant, R.T. Can. 1992 n\u00b0 3 (la CDE), entr\u00e9e en vigueur pour le Canada le 12 janvier 1992. Les enfants ont les m\u00eames droits de la personne que les adultes. Cependant, ils sont plus vuln\u00e9rables et doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de moyens de protection qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 leurs besoins sp\u00e9ciaux. En cons\u00e9quence, la CDE vise \u00e0 leur garantir les soins, l\u2019assistance et la protection juridique sp\u00e9ciaux dont ils ont besoin (voir, notamment, les articles 2, 3, 5, 7.1, 8.1, 9, 9.1, 18.1, 20, 25 et 30). De plus, lorsqu\u2019il a ratifi\u00e9 la CDE, le Canada a \u00e9mis une d\u00e9claration interpr\u00e9tative dans laquelle il a reconnu que, en d\u00e9terminant les mesures \u00e0 prendre pour mettre en \u0153uvre les droits garantis dans la Convention aux enfants autochtones, il faudra s\u2019assurer de respecter le droit de jouir de leur propre culture, de professer et de pratiquer leur propre religion et de parler leur propre langue (Convention relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant, D\u00e9clarations et r\u00e9serves, Canada, en ligne : Nations Unies <http:\/\/www.treaties. un.org>).\n[449] L\u2019organisme de surveillance de la CDE, le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019enfant, a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance de veiller \u00e0 ce que les enfants autochtones aient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services culturellement adapt\u00e9s (voir l\u2019Observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u00b0 11, 12 f\u00e9vrier 2009 (CRC\/C\/GC\/11), par. 25). En ce qui concerne les soins de l\u2019enfant et les services de soutien, le Canada a signal\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]e gouvernement du Canada assume un r\u00f4le de soutien sous forme de prestations pour les enfants et les familles et il transf\u00e8re des fonds \u00e0 d\u2019autres gouvernements au Canada qui ont des buts et des objectifs communs \u00bb (Troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me rapports du Canada sur la Convention relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant, 20 novembre 2009, par. 49). Le Canada a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, comme il l\u2019avait fait dans son rapport au CDESC, qu\u2019il transformait progressivement ses programmes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance pour les enfants autochtones en une approche ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention et qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voyait que tous les organismes utiliseraient cette approche d\u2019ici 2013 (voir le par. 98).\n[450] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Canada, le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019enfant s\u2019est dit profond\u00e9ment pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 \u00ab par le grand nombre d\u2019enfants plac\u00e9s et par le fait que les enfants soient souvent enlev\u00e9s \u00e0 leur famille en premier recours dans les cas de n\u00e9gligence, de difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res ou d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00bb (Observations finales sur les troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me rapports p\u00e9riodiques du Canada, soumis en un seul document, adopt\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa soixante et uni\u00e8me session (17 septembre \u2013 5 octobre 2012), 6 d\u00e9cembre 2012 (CRC\/C\/CAN\/CO\/3-4), par. 55). Le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019enfant a notamment recommand\u00e9 au Canada \u00ab d\u2019intensifier la coop\u00e9ration avec tous les dirigeants des communaut\u00e9s minoritaires et des diverses communaut\u00e9s afin de trouver des solutions adapt\u00e9es pour les enfants de ces communaut\u00e9s qui ont besoin d\u2019une protection de remplacement \u00bb [al. 56f)]. Il a \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 au Canada \u00ab [d]e veiller \u00e0 ce que les prestations et autres dispositifs de soutien, y compris les services sociaux, fournis aux enfants autochtones, afro-canadiens et aux enfants appartenant \u00e0 d\u2019autres minorit\u00e9s soient d\u2019une qualit\u00e9 et d\u2019une accessibilit\u00e9 comparables \u00e0 celles des services fournis aux autres enfants dans l\u2019\u00c9tat partie et suffisent \u00e0 couvrir leurs besoins \u00bb [al. 68c)].\n[451] Encore l\u00e0, les recommandations du Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019enfant renforcent la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir un financement ad\u00e9quat, correspondant aux besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, afin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle dans la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[452] Enfin, le 12 novembre 2010, le Canada a appuy\u00e9 la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, R\u00e9s. GA 61\/295, Doc. off., 61e session, suppl. n\u00b0 49, vol. III, Doc. NU A\/61\/49 (2007) (la DNUDPA), que l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations Unies a adopt\u00e9e le 13 septembre 2007. L\u2019article 2 pr\u00e9voit que les Autochtones, peuples et individus, sont libres et \u00e9gaux \u00e0 tous les autres et ont le droit de ne faire l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune forme de discrimination dans l\u2019exercice de leurs droits, en particulier les droits d\u00e9coulant de leur origine ou leur identit\u00e9 autochtone. Bien que cet instrument international soit, pour l\u2019instant, une d\u00e9claration et non un trait\u00e9 ou un pacte et qu\u2019il ne soit pas juridiquement contraignant, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 certaines de ses dispositions correspondent \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles du droit international coutumier, lorsque le Canada l\u2019a appuy\u00e9, il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son engagement d\u2019 \u00ab [\u2026] accro\u00eetre le bien-\u00eatre des Autochtones canadiens \u00bb (\u00c9nonc\u00e9 du Canada appuyant la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, 12 novembre 2010, en ligne : Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada https:\/\/www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca\/fra\/1309374239861\/1309374546142\n[453] Selon les instruments internationaux et les organismes de surveillance des trait\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s, l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre r\u00e9elle et non seulement formelle. En cons\u00e9quence, il est souvent n\u00e9cessaire de prendre mes mesures particuli\u00e8res, y compris des mesures de nature budg\u00e9taire, pour atteindre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle. Ces instruments juridiques internationaux renforcent \u00e9galement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder l\u2019attention n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la situation et aux besoins uniques des enfants et des membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations, en particulier \u00e0 ceux des enfants, qui sont vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 la fois comme enfants et comme membres d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation.\n[454] Les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par les organismes de surveillance internationaux refl\u00e8tent bon nombre des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Les d\u00e9clarations du Canada dans les rapports p\u00e9riodiques qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux diff\u00e9rents organismes de surveillance des trait\u00e9s montrent sans conteste que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est conscient des mesures \u00e0 prendre, au niveau national, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations. Il ne faut pas que les d\u00e9clarations et les engagements du Canada, qu\u2019ils soient exprim\u00e9s sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale ou nationale, ne soient rien de plus qu\u2019un exercice de rh\u00e9torique.\n[455] L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et les obligations internationales du Canada exigent que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves re\u00e7oivent des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille dont la qualit\u00e9 et l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 sont comparables \u00e0 celles des services offerts \u00e0 tous les Canadiens vivant hors r\u00e9serve. Cela inclut que ces services soient financ\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate afin de r\u00e9pondre aux v\u00e9ritables besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations et qu\u2019ils ne perp\u00e9tuent pas un d\u00e9savantage historique.\nVI. Plainte jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e\n[456] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal conclut que les plaignantes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve suffisante afin de rencontrer leur fardeau de preuve de mani\u00e8re prima facie afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elles ont \u00e9tabli prima facie que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant une r\u00e9serve et au Yukon sont priv\u00e9s de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille \u00e9gaux [al. 5a)] ou qu\u2019ils sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de ces services [al. 5b)].\n[457] AADNC offre un service visant \u00e0 \u00ab assurer \u00bb, \u00ab procurer \u00bb et \u00ab soutenir \u00bb des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et \u00e0 les \u00ab mettre \u00e0 leur disposition \u00bb, par le biais du Programme des SEFPN et d\u2019autres ententes provinciales ou territoriales connexes. En ce qui a trait plus particuli\u00e8rement au Programme des SEFPN, l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 est d\u2019assurer des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon qui sont adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture, conformes aux lois et aux normes provinciales ou territoriales et fournis de mani\u00e8re raisonnablement comparable \u00e0 ceux qui sont offerts aux autres r\u00e9sidents de la province ou du territoire dans des circonstances semblables. La preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9montre toutefois qu\u2019AADNC ne se contente pas d\u2019assurer la fourniture de services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, mais qu\u2019il contr\u00f4le la mani\u00e8re dont ces services sont dispens\u00e9s par le truchement de ses m\u00e9canismes de financement, au point de nuire aux enfants et aux familles vivant dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[458] La conception, la gestion et le contr\u00f4le du Programme des SEFPN par AADNC, ainsi que ses mod\u00e8les de financement et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes, se sont traduits par des refus de services et ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 divers effets pr\u00e9judiciables pour un grand nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Voici une liste non exhaustive des principaux effets pr\u00e9judiciables constat\u00e9s par le Tribunal :\nLe mod\u00e8le de financement de la Directive 20\u20111, tel que con\u00e7u et appliqu\u00e9, met en place un financement fond\u00e9 sur des hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es quant au nombre d\u2019enfants pris en charge et aux seuils de population, qui ne refl\u00e8tent pas fid\u00e8lement les besoins en mati\u00e8re de services d\u2019un bon nombre des collectivit\u00e9s des r\u00e9serves. Cette situation se traduit par un financement fixe insuffisant des frais d\u2019exploitation (co\u00fbts d\u2019immobilisation, bureaux multiples, ajustement pour tenir compte du co\u00fbt de la vie, salaires et avantages sociaux du personnel, formation, frais juridiques, \u00e9loignement et frais de d\u00e9placement) et des services de pr\u00e9vention (services primaires, secondaires et tertiaires pour s\u2019assurer que les enfants demeurent en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans leur milieu familial).Cela nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des organismes de SEFPN de fournir les services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance exig\u00e9s par les provinces et les territoires et, \u00e0 plus forte raison, des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 culturelle des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations.Cela cr\u00e9e \u00e9galement une incitation \u00e0 placer les enfants en famille d\u2019accueil parce que les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien admissibles sont remboursables au prix co\u00fbtant.\nLa structure et la mise en \u0153uvre actuelles du mod\u00e8le de financement de l\u2019AAAP, perp\u00e9tuent l\u2019incitation \u00e0 retirer les enfants de leur milieu familial et reprennent les hypoth\u00e8ses erron\u00e9es de la Directive 20\u20111 en ce qui a trait au financement de l\u2019exploitation et des services de pr\u00e9vention.Elles perp\u00e9tuent les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de la Directive 20\u20111 dans bon nombre des collectivit\u00e9s des r\u00e9serves.\nLes niveaux de financement de Directive 20\u20111 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajust\u00e9s depuis 1995, et de ceux de l\u2019AAAP depuis sa mise en \u0153uvre, pour tenir compte de l\u2019inflation et du co\u00fbt de la vie.\nL\u2019Entente de 1965 en Ontario n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour pour s\u2019assurer que les collectivit\u00e9s des r\u00e9serves puissent se conformer pleinement \u00e0 la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario.\nL\u2019absence de coordination du Programme des SEFPN et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes avec d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res et d\u2019autres programmes et services du gouvernement destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves, a entra\u00een\u00e9 des interruptions, des retards et des refus de services pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\nLa d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite et l\u2019application insuffisante du principe de Jordan, ont entra\u00een\u00e9 des interruptions, des d\u00e9lais et des refus de services pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[459] Le Programme des SEFPN, les mod\u00e8les de financement et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes ne s\u2019appliquent qu\u2019aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans des r\u00e9serves et au Yukon. C\u2019est uniquement en raison de leur race, ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, qu\u2019ils subissent les effets pr\u00e9judiciables que nous avons \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De plus, ces effets pr\u00e9judiciables perp\u00e9tuent les d\u00e9savantages historiques et les traumatismes subis par les peuples autochtones, notamment en raison du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens.\n[460] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par AADNC pour contester les all\u00e9gations de discrimination des plaignantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Dans l\u2019ensemble, le Tribunal conclut que la th\u00e8se d\u2019AADNC est d\u00e9raisonnable, qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas convaincante et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par ailleurs, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, AADNC n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une des exceptions pr\u00e9vues aux articles 15 et 16 de la LCDP.\n[461] Bien qu\u2019il soit au courant, depuis des ann\u00e9es, des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9fastes du Programme des SEFPN, AADNC ne l\u2019a pas vraiment modifi\u00e9 depuis sa cr\u00e9ation en 1990. Les annexes de l\u2019Entente de 1965 de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 jour non plus depuis 1998. De nombreux rapports et recommandations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s pour proposer des solutions aux effets pr\u00e9judiciables susmentionn\u00e9es, incluant les propres analyses et \u00e9valuations internes d\u2019AADNC. Malgr\u00e9 tout, AADNC n\u2019a donn\u00e9 suite que parcimonieusement aux conclusions de ces rapports. Certes, AANDC a fait des efforts pour am\u00e9liorer le Programme des SEFPN, notamment par l\u2019adoption de l\u2019AAAP et l\u2019injection de fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, ces mesures sont loin de combler les lacunes constat\u00e9es dans la prestation des services et de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019interruption, de refus de services et les effets pr\u00e9judiciables que nous avons \u00e9voqu\u00e9s. En fin de compte, ces mesures ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 l\u2019objectif de fournir aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves des services adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture autochtone, qui se comparent raisonnablement \u00e0 ceux offerts aux personnes vivant hors r\u00e9serve.\n[462] Ce concept de comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable est une des questions au c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me. AADNC a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019il signifie et \u00e0 le mettre en pratique, surtout parce que ses autorisations de financement et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il en fait ne s\u2019accordent pas avec les lois et les normes provinciales et territoriales. AANDC n\u2019est pas un expert dans le domaine des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et il est conscient que le financement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses autorisations est souvent insuffisant pour respecter les lois et les normes provinciales et territoriales. N\u00e9anmoins, il insiste pour que les organismes de SEFPN trouvent une mani\u00e8re de respecter ces normes et fournissent aux enfants et aux familles des services raisonnablement comparables. Au lieu d\u2019\u00e9valuer les besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations et de s\u2019inspirer des lois et des normes provinciales pour concevoir un programme apte \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces besoins, AADNC a plut\u00f4t choisi de r\u00e9agir de mani\u00e8re ponctuelle pour apporter les changements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son programme.\n[463] La mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019AAAP est mise en \u0153uvre en est un exemple. AADNC apporte des am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 son programme et \u00e0 sa m\u00e9thode de financement. Toutefois, en le faisant, il incorpore un mod\u00e8le dont il sait qu\u2019il comporte des lacunes. AADNC tente d\u2019obtenir des variables comparables des provinces pour les faire cadrer avec ce mod\u00e8le de co\u00fbt. Toutefois, il ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 obtenir toutes les variables pertinentes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il arrive souvent que les provinces ne calculent pas les choses de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on ou n\u2019utilisent pas de formule de financement. Par analogie, c\u2019est comme si on ajoutait des piliers de soutien \u00e0 une maison qui repose sur des fondations faibles, pour tenter de la redresser et de la soutenir. A un moment donn\u00e9, il faut r\u00e9parer les fondations, au risque de voir cette maison s\u2019\u00e9crouler. Ainsi, il est n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une R\u00c9FORME du Programme des SEFPN pour solidifier les fondations du programme afin de r\u00e9pondre aux v\u00e9ritables besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves.\n[464] Comme elles ne sont pas expertes dans le domaine de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, les autorit\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC se pr\u00e9occupent surtout de la comparabilit\u00e9 des niveaux de financement. Par contre, les lois et les normes provinciales et territoriales en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille visent \u00e0 assurer que les niveaux de services sont conformes aux saines m\u00e9thodes en mati\u00e8re de travail social et qu\u2019ils respectent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant. Il est difficile, voire impossible, de s\u2019assurer que les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille sont raisonnablement comparables lorsqu\u2019il existe une dichotomie entre financement comparable et services comparables. En effet, cette m\u00e9thodologie ne tient pas compte des besoins plus grands de services que l\u2019on constate chez bon nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves ni du co\u00fbt plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la prestation de ces services dans bon nombre de situations. De plus, cette m\u00e9thodologie fait ressortir les lacunes inh\u00e9rentes aux hypoth\u00e8ses et aux niveaux de population int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au Programme des SEFPN.\n[465] La norme de la comparabilit\u00e9 raisonnable d\u2019AADNC ne garantit pas aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle dans la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il vaut la peine de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les propos tenus par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Withler, au paragraphe 59 : \u00ab il peut \u00eatre impossible de trouver un groupe de comparaison repr\u00e9sentant des caract\u00e9ristiques identiques, car l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la personne ou du groupe en cause peut reposer essentiellement sur le fait que, compte tenu de leur situation et de leurs besoins distincts, il n\u2019existe aucun groupe analogue auquel ils puissent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s \u00bb. Cette affirmation cadre bien dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Autrement dit, les principes de droits de la personne, tant en droit canadien qu\u2019en droit international, obligent AADNC \u00e0 tenir compte des besoins distincts et de la situation particuli\u00e8re des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves \u2013 y compris leur situation et leurs besoins culturels, historiques et g\u00e9ographiques \u2013 pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Une strat\u00e9gie reposant sur des niveaux de financement comparables et sur l\u2019application de mod\u00e8les type de financement ne suffit pas pour garantir aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans la prestation de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[466] Par cons\u00e9quent, et apr\u00e8s avoir pes\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[467] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet les souffrances des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations priv\u00e9s d\u2019une chance \u00e9quitable de demeurer unis ou d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9unis en temps opportun. Nous reconnaissons \u00e9galement les familles et les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui sont, ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s par les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance actuelles et pass\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es par le gouvernement du Canada dans les r\u00e9serves.\nVII. Ordonnance\n[468] Comme le Tribunal juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, il peut rendre une ordonnance contre AADNC en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP. Le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) ne vise pas \u00e0 punir AADNC, mais \u00e0 supprimer la discrimination (Robichaud, par. 13). Pour y parvenir, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration sur une base rationnelle, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, par. 37). En d\u2019autres termes, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire et en tenant compte de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, par. 50).\n[469] Il est \u00e9galement important de rappeler que la LCDP consacre des droits qui rev\u00eatent une importance primordiale. Ces droits doivent \u00eatre pleinement reconnus et mis en oeuvre par le biais de la Loi. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9laborer des r\u00e9parations sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au Tribunal en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation des objets de la Loi. Lorsqu\u2019on applique une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par la LCDP devraient promouvoir efficacement le droit \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger et d\u00e9fendre utilement les droits et libert\u00e9s de la victime de l\u2019acte discriminatoire (CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 RCS 1114, p. 1134; et Doucet\u2011Boudreau, par. 25 et 55).\n[470] Les plaignantes, la Commission et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es r\u00e9clament diverses r\u00e9parations pour donner suite aux conclusions du Tribunal en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elles demandent notamment des ordonnances d\u00e9claratoires, des ordonnances enjoignant \u00e0 AADNC de cesser les actes discriminatoires et lui ordonnant de prendre des mesures pour les corriger ou pour emp\u00eacher qu\u2019ils se produisent de nouveau, ainsi que le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\n[471] De plus, ind\u00e9pendamment des r\u00e9parations r\u00e9clam\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 53(2), le Tribunal est saisi d\u2019une requ\u00eate ant\u00e9rieure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignantes en vue d\u2019obtenir les d\u00e9pens se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure contre AADNC, en raison de sa production tardive de documents.\nA. Conclusion de discrimination\n[472] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9mettre plusieurs d\u00e9clarations pour pr\u00e9ciser quels aspects du Programme des SEFPN, des mod\u00e8les de financement et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes sont discriminatoires. Selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, le Tribunal prononce r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des ordonnances d\u00e9claratoires sous forme de constats de discrimination.\n[473] En effet, tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au paragraphe 458, le Tribunal a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 les principaux effets pr\u00e9judiciables du Programme des SEFPN et des autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes qu\u2019il a constat\u00e9s. Comme la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique est l\u2019un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 aux effets pr\u00e9judiciables en question, le Tribunal a conclu que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves et au Yukon sont victimes de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille par AADNC. Le Tribunal estime que ces conclusions r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ordonnance d\u00e9claratoire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien.\nB. Mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire et prendre des mesures pour corriger la situation et pour emp\u00eacher qu\u2019elle se reproduise\n[474] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP permet au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la personne jug\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00ab de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir le m\u00eame acte ou des actes semblables \u00bb. De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 cette personne \u00ab [...] d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[475] Les plaignantes et la Commission r\u00e9clament, en vertu de ces dispositions, une r\u00e9paration imm\u00e9diate au profit des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. \u00c0 leur avis, ce r\u00e9sultat peut \u00eatre obtenu en ordonnant \u00e0 AADNC de supprimer les aspects les plus discriminatoires des r\u00e9gimes de financement dont il se sert pour financer les organismes de SEFPN en vertu du Programme des SEFPN et des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965. De plus, elles demandent que le Tribunal oblige AADNC \u00e0 appliquer correctement le principe de Jordan. \u00c0 plus long terme, les plaignantes et la Commission demandent au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 AADNC de modifier le Programme des SEFPN et l\u2019Entente de 1965 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves un niveau \u00e9quitable de service et de financement de ces services.\n[476] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a propos\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode d\u00e9taill\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser cette r\u00e9forme. Elle propose un processus en trois \u00e9tapes pour red\u00e9finir le Programme des SEFPN : (1) convoquer de nouveau le Comit\u00e9 consultatif national pour identifier les \u00e9l\u00e9ments discriminatoires dans le financement fourni aux organismes de SEFPN et faire des recommandations \u00e0 ce sujet; (2) financer des tables r\u00e9gionales tripartites charg\u00e9es de n\u00e9gocier la mise en \u0153uvre de m\u00e9canismes et de politiques de financement adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture pour chaque r\u00e9gion; (3) mettre sur pied une structure d\u2019experts ind\u00e9pendants ayant les pouvoirs et le mandat n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer qu\u2019AADNC offre aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations des services non discriminatoires adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture.\n[477] Corollairement, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement l\u2019affichage public des renseignements concernant le Programme des SEFPN, le principe de Jordan et le placement d\u2019enfants en foyer d\u2019accueil, pour informer les organismes de SEFPN et le public au sujet des politiques, des pratiques et des directives d\u2019AADNC en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, ainsi que pour contribuer \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir d\u2019autres actes discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. De plus, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que le personnel d\u2019AADNC re\u00e7oive des s\u00e9ances de formation sur la culture des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les d\u00e9savantages historiques, les droits de la personne et le travail social.\n[478] L\u2019APN r\u00e9clame une r\u00e9forme semblable, incluant une \u00e9tude pour d\u00e9terminer les moyens les plus efficaces pour offrir des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations et un meilleur syst\u00e8me de mesure et d\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement des employ\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC dans la prestation des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. De m\u00eame, en Ontario, COO r\u00e9clame la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une \u00e9tude ind\u00e9pendante portant sur le financement et les niveaux de service en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario en vertu de l\u2019Entente de 1965.\n[479] Amnistie internationale souligne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder des mesures de r\u00e9paration efficaces et rapides pour assurer que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves obtiennent une \u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, conform\u00e9ment aux obligations internationales du Canada. Amnesty Internationale sugg\u00e8re notamment une augmentation du financement et des changements structurels et syst\u00e9miques en ce qui concerne la mani\u00e8re dont AADNC fournit son financement. Elle sugg\u00e8re \u00e9galement la mise en place d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme de contr\u00f4le syst\u00e9matique d\u00e9taill\u00e9, pour s\u2019assurer que les droits des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations ne soient plus viol\u00e9s.\n[480] AADNC affirme que, bien que le Tribunal puisse ordonner que des modifications soient apport\u00e9es aux politiques et qu\u2019il puisse donner des indications pour orienter ces modifications, il ne peut prescrire les politiques pr\u00e9cises qui doivent \u00eatre adopt\u00e9es. Selon AADNC, cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, car la politique en cause est un m\u00e9canisme complexe, qui tient compte de priorit\u00e9s concurrentes et qui doit cadrer avec de plus larges orientations politiques du gouvernement. De telles d\u00e9cisions exigent un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de retenue de la part du Tribunal et une grande marge d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re raisonnable pour AANDC. De plus, AADNC soutient que la r\u00e9paration propos\u00e9e empi\u00e9terait sur le r\u00f4le d\u00e9volu au pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif de d\u00e9finir les orientations du gouvernement et de g\u00e9rer la d\u00e9pense de deniers publics conform\u00e9ment aux priorit\u00e9s fiscales. AADNC craint \u00e9galement que certaines des modifications propos\u00e9es aient une port\u00e9e trop large et d\u00e9bordent le cadre de la plainte. Il consid\u00e8re donc que certains aspects de la m\u00e9thodologie propos\u00e9e par les plaignantes exc\u00e8dent la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal ou de toute autre cour de justice en mati\u00e8re d\u2019ordonnance.\n[481] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal est favorable aux demandes de r\u00e9paration imm\u00e9diate et aux m\u00e9thodes de r\u00e9vision de la prestation de services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, mais il reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement le besoin d\u2019\u00e9quilibre pr\u00e9conis\u00e9 par AADNC. Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 AADNC de mettre fin \u00e0 ses actes discriminatoires et de modifier le Programme des SEFPN et l\u2019Entente de 1965 conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal enjoint \u00e9galement \u00e0 AADNC de cesser d\u2019appliquer sa d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre des mesures pour appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens.\n[482] Au-del\u00e0 du simple financement, il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9orienter le programme de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 respecter les principes des droits de la personne et \u00e0 tenir compte des saines pratiques en mati\u00e8re de travail social. Dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant, tous les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves devraient avoir droit, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins \u00bb (LCDP, art. 2).\n[483] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, compte tenu de la complexit\u00e9 et de la port\u00e9e consid\u00e9rable des cons\u00e9quences de la r\u00e9paration r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, le Tribunal tient \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les autres mesures qu\u2019il ordonne sont appropri\u00e9es et \u00e9quitables tant \u00e0 court terme qu\u2019\u00e0 long terme. Pendant tout le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance, le Tribunal s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de poser des questions d\u2019\u00e9claircissement aux parties au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019il prenait connaissance de la preuve. Certes, des actes discriminatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis et le sont toujours, mais le Tribunal se demande encore quelle est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette discrimination. Le Tribunal a besoin d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements des parties au sujet des mesures concr\u00e8tes de r\u00e9paration r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, notamment sur la mani\u00e8re la plus pratique, concr\u00e8te et efficace de mettre en \u0153uvre les r\u00e9formes \u00e0 court terme et \u00e0 long terme r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\n[484] Dans les trois semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal communiquera avec les parties pour mettre au point un processus permettant de r\u00e9pondre de fa\u00e7on acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e aux questions non encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9es quant aux mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9\n[485] Le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)(e). De plus, le paragraphe 53(3) permet au Tribunal de condamner l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 si l\u2019acte discriminatoire \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans les deux cas, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale est de 20 000 $.\n[486] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande au Tribunal de condamner AADNC, en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), \u00e0 verser une indemnit\u00e9 pour des actes discriminatoires d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 chacun des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations pris en charge depuis f\u00e9vrier 2006 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la d\u00e9cision. Selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, d\u00e8s 2000, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance des conclusions formul\u00e9es par l\u2019EPN, AADNC a volontairement et manifestement omis de corriger la discrimination dont \u00e9taient victimes les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Elle souligne \u00e9galement que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de l\u2019argent qu\u2019il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de consacrer \u00e0 la prestation de services \u00e9gaux aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien estime que le montant maximal de 20 000 $ devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 pour chaque enfant. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 en question soit plac\u00e9e dans une fiducie ind\u00e9pendante pour financer des activit\u00e9s de gu\u00e9rison au profit des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ont souffert de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille.\n[487] L\u2019APN r\u00e9clame elle aussi une indemnit\u00e9. Elle sollicite une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l\u2019APN, \u00e0 AADNC, \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et \u00e0 la Commission de constituer un groupe d\u2019experts charg\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une indemnit\u00e9 individuelle appropri\u00e9e pour les parents, les enfants et les fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs ayant subi les cons\u00e9quences des m\u00e9thodes d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance utilis\u00e9es dans les r\u00e9serves entre 2006 et la date de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal.\n[488] Amnistie internationale soutient que toute indemnit\u00e9 devrait tenir compte \u00e0 la fois du pr\u00e9judice physique et du pr\u00e9judice psychologique y compris le pr\u00e9judice moral et l\u2019atteinte intrins\u00e8que \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 subis en raison des violations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises.\n[489] AADNC affirme que le Tribunal ne dispose pas de suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour accorder les indemnit\u00e9s r\u00e9clam\u00e9es. Il soutient que la r\u00e9clamation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est mal fond\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle repose sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se non prouv\u00e9e que tous les enfants en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s de leur milieu familial en raison des m\u00e9thodes de financement d\u2019AADNC. Selon AADNC, les affirmations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien m\u00e9connaissent la nature complexe des facteurs qui entrent en jeu lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de retirer un enfant de son milieu familial. Il ajoute qu\u2019il est impossible pour le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer une indemnit\u00e9 sur une base individuelle, compte tenu de l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve individuels \u00e0 ce sujet. De plus, AADNC affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les plaignantes sont autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 recevoir et \u00e0 distribuer des fonds au nom des \u00ab victimes \u00bb.\n[490] Conform\u00e9ment aux commentaires qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mis, le Tribunal a encore des questions concernant la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 des plaignantes en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Dans les trois semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal communiquera avec les parties pour mettre au point un processus permettant d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9ponses aux questions non encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9es en ce qui concerne les mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nD. D\u00e9pens pour entrave \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure\n[491] Les plaignantes ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de condamner AADNC aux d\u00e9pens pour son entrave all\u00e9gu\u00e9e au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure, dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en divulgation adjug\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision 2013 TCDP 16. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il mettait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 la question de la demande de d\u00e9pens et qu\u2019elle ferait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure. Les plaignantes ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 leur demande de d\u00e9pens dans le cadre de leurs observations finales sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte. En r\u00e9ponse, AADNC a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger de tels d\u00e9pens.\n[492] Le Tribunal maintient sa d\u00e9cision de diff\u00e9rer son jugement sur la demande de d\u00e9pens relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en divulgation faisant l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9cision 2013 TCDP 16. Une d\u00e9cision sur cette question sera rendue en temps utile.\nE. Le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence\n[493] Les plaignantes, la Commission et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es demandent au Tribunal de demeurer saisi de la pr\u00e9sente affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que toutes les ordonnances aient \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es.\n[494] Comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, le Tribunal a encore des questions \u00e0 \u00e9claircir au sujet des r\u00e9parations r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par les plaignantes et la Commission. Une d\u00e9cision doit encore \u00eatre rendue sur ces r\u00e9parations. Le Tribunal demeurera donc saisi de la pr\u00e9sente affaire en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue sur ces r\u00e9parations. Une fois ces d\u00e9cisions rendues, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera s\u2019il doit continuer de demeurer saisi.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nEdward P.

Le lieu de l\u2019audition\n[1] Au titre de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), Mme Sandra Temple affirme qu\u2019Horizon International Distributors (Horizon) lui a fait subir un traitement d\u00e9favorable, pour finalement mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de facteurs li\u00e9s \u00e0 son sexe et \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate suivante d\u00e9termine le lieu de l\u2019audition de la plainte de Mme Temple. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des parties sur la question, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019audition se tiendra \u00e0 Calgary pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par Mme Temple, et \u00e0 Winnipeg pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par Horizon.\nII. Les positions des parties\n[3] Horizon demande que l\u2019audition de la plainte de Mme Temple se tienne \u00e0 Winnipeg (Manitoba). Elle soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit du lieu le plus pratique et le plus \u00e9conomique compte tenu de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se trouvent les parties et les t\u00e9moins. Entre autres, les activit\u00e9s et les huit t\u00e9moins d\u2019Horizon sont \u00e0 Winnipeg. De plus, sept des huit t\u00e9moins d\u2019Horizon travaillent pour l\u2019entreprise et, s\u2019ils doivent se d\u00e9placer \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Winnipeg pour l\u2019audition, cela occasionnera non seulement des frais importants \u00e0 Horizon, mais perturbera aussi ses activit\u00e9s. Ces frais ne sont pas recouvrables par Horizon. Horizon soutient donc qu\u2019il est injuste et in\u00e9quitable que l\u2019audition se tienne ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[4] Mme Temple demande que l\u2019audition se tienne \u00e0 Calgary (Alberta). Pour des raisons financi\u00e8res et familiales, il s\u2019agirait du lieu le moins perturbateur pour elle. Mme Temple et sa m\u00e8re, dont elle prend soin, se trouvent pr\u00e8s de Calgary. Le mari de Mme Temple, qui a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, se trouve aussi pr\u00e8s de Calgary. L\u2019autre t\u00e9moin de Mme Temple est \u00e0 Chilliwack (Colombie\u2011Britannique). Subsidiairement, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 je d\u00e9ciderais que l\u2019audition se tiendra \u00e0 Winnipeg, Mme Temple demande qu\u2019Horizon lui rembourse des frais de d\u00e9placement et d\u2019h\u00e9bergement et des d\u00e9bours raisonnables pour la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audition.\n[5] La Commission constate une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de pouvoir entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le fait de tenir l\u2019audition \u00e0 Winnipeg \u00e9loignerait Mme Temple de son domicile et pourrait \u00eatre intimidant pour une plaignante se repr\u00e9sentant elle\u2011m\u00eame. Si l\u2019audition devait se tenir \u00e0 Winnipeg, la Commission souscrit \u00e0 la demande de Mme Temple voulant qu\u2019Horizon lui rembourse les frais raisonnables encourus pour y assister.\nIII. La conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance du 7 novembre 2016\n[6] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance tenue le 7 novembre 2016, les parties et moi avons discut\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate relative au lieu de l\u2019audition d\u2019Horizon et des observations \u00e9crites de chacune des parties.\n[7] En r\u00e9ponse aux observations de Mme Temple, Horizon a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la plaignante n\u2019a aucun lien avec Calgary. De plus, compte tenu de son sommaire de d\u00e9position, Horizon entend s\u2019opposer au t\u00e9moignage du mari de Mme Temple en tant que preuve corroborante ou par ou\u00ef\u2011dire. Elle soutient donc que peu de poids devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se trouve M. Temple pour d\u00e9terminer le lieu de l\u2019audition.\n[8] Quant \u00e0 la demande de remboursement de frais de Mme Temple, j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de rendre une telle ordonnance dans les circonstances.\n[9] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement soumis une troisi\u00e8me option \u00e0 l\u2019examen des parties, soit celle de la tenue d\u2019une audition en deux lieux, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que lorsque Mme Temple pr\u00e9senterait ses arguments, l\u2019audition se tiendrait \u00e0 Calgary et que lorsqu\u2019Horizon pr\u00e9senterait ses arguments, l\u2019audition se tiendrait \u00e0 Winnipeg. En chaque lieu, les parties pourraient, \u00e0 leur choix, avoir recours \u00e0 la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence pour assister \u00e0 l\u2019audition et ainsi \u00e9viter des frais de d\u00e9placement. Toutes les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la tenue de l\u2019audition, y compris la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, seraient prises par le Tribunal.\n[10] Mme Temple et la Commission \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 accepter cette option, mais, apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen plus approfondi de la question \u00e0 la suite de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, Horizon a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 consentir \u00e0 l\u2019option de la tenue d\u2019une audition en deux lieux. L\u2019avocat et un repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019Horizon pr\u00e9f\u00e9reraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents lors du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Temple afin de bien le comprendre et d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre correctement. Selon Horizon, les d\u00e9tails fournis dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Temple sont difficiles \u00e0 suivre et cela lui nuirait consid\u00e9rablement de ne pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente physiquement lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Bien que cette option permette d\u2019all\u00e9ger son fardeau financier, elle obligerait quand m\u00eame l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 engager des frais de d\u00e9placement et d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, de sorte qu\u2019Horizon soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agirait pas d\u2019une option \u00e9conomique pour elle.\nIV. Analyse\n[11] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal tient l\u2019audition \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a eu lieu o\u00f9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit qui pr\u00e9sente le lien le plus \u00e9troit avec la conduite discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Cependant, ce n\u2019est pas une r\u00e8gle stricte et le Tribunal s\u2019efforce de tenir compte des besoins des parties, s\u2019il y a lieu (voir Baumbach c. Deer Lake Education Authority, 2004 TCDP 13, au paragraphe 6). Il doit essentiellement s\u2019assurer que le lieu de l\u2019audition respecte les normes de la LCDP qui exigent un processus d\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable, informel, exp\u00e9ditif et ouvert, o\u00f9 chaque partie a la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de faire des observations (voir les paragraphes 48.9(1), 50(1) et 52(1) de la LCDP).\n[12] La discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu directement \u00e0 Winnipeg ou \u00e0 Calgary, et aucun de ces endroits ne pr\u00e9sente de lien \u00e9troit avec la conduite discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Il en est ainsi parce qu\u2019Horizon est une entreprise de camionnage et que Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e par Horizon comme chauffeur\u2011propri\u00e9taire de camion transportant des chargements en de nombreux endroits entre Winnipeg et Vancouver. La plupart, sinon la totalit\u00e9, des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Temple sont survenus pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait sur la route, loin de chez elle et des bureaux d\u2019Horizon.\n[13] Cela dit, je comprends les pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par chacune des parties. Compte tenu de ces pr\u00e9occupations, j\u2019estime que le fait de tenir l\u2019audition \u00e0 Winnipeg et \u00e0 Calgary r\u00e9pondrait le mieux aux besoins de Mme Temple et d\u2019Horizon.\n[14] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la tenue d\u2019une audition en deux lieux r\u00e9duit les frais de d\u00e9placement de chacune des parties. Mme Temple n\u2019aura pas \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg, et seuls l\u2019avocat d\u2019Horizon et un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019entreprise se rendront \u00e0 Calgary s\u2019ils d\u00e9cident de ne pas utiliser l\u2019option de la participation par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Les t\u00e9moins d\u2019Horizon n\u2019auront pas \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Calgary, ce qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise d\u2019\u00e9viter ces frais et r\u00e9pond \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9occupation concernant la perturbation de ses activit\u00e9s.\n[15] La tenue d\u2019une audition en deux lieux permet \u00e9galement \u00e0 Mme Temple et \u00e0 Horizon d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments \u00e0 l\u2019endroit qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent. Le fait de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 Calgary, et de participer par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 la partie de l\u2019audition tenue \u00e0 Winnipeg, am\u00e9liore la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Temple d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019audition et lui permet d\u2019\u00eatre dans un environnement o\u00f9 elle se sent bien et o\u00f9 elle peut continuer \u00e0 prendre soin de sa m\u00e8re.\n[16] Quant \u00e0 Horizon, bien que la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence existe, la tenue d\u2019une audition en deux lieux permet de tenir pleinement compte du fait qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente physiquement lors du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Temple. Elle permet \u00e9galement de tenir compte du fait qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re pr\u00e9senter ses arguments \u00e0 Winnipeg.\nV. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[17] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire se tiendra \u00e0 Calgary pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par Mme Temple, et \u00e0 Winnipeg pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par Horizon.\n[18] Je propose \u00e9galement aux parties d\u2019utiliser d\u2019autres m\u00e9thodes visant \u00e0 simplifier et \u00e0 acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l\u2019audition afin de rendre la tenue de cette audition en deux lieux encore plus efficace pour les deux parties. Par exemple, j\u2019invite les parties \u00e0 envisager la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et \u00e0 songer \u00e0 utiliser des affidavits pour l\u2019interrogatoire principal de leurs t\u00e9moins.\n[19] Les m\u00e9thodes susmentionn\u00e9es ainsi que les autres d\u00e9tails logistiques de l\u2019audition (comme les dates, les installations, les exigences relatives \u00e0 la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, les exigences relatives \u00e0 la ligne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de recueils de documents et la pr\u00e9sentation des conclusions finales) feront l\u2019objet de discussions avec les parties lors d\u2019une prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 22 d\u00e9cembre 2016",

Introduction\n[1] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance rejetant une partie de la plainte, pour le motif que celle-ci n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP). Cette disposition permet \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission ou la CCDP) de refuser de statuer sur une plainte qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter la requ\u00eate pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\nII. Contexte\n[2] Dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 23 novembre 2009, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait subi un traitement le d\u00e9favorisant en cours d\u2019emploi au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, sur le fondement de la d\u00e9ficience. Les all\u00e9gations s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur une p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 22 avril 2008 et se poursuivant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Les actes reproch\u00e9s se rapportent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales du plaignant et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re comme le manquement de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de lui attribuer des t\u00e2ches qui respectaient ces restrictions, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la gestion de son retour au travail apr\u00e8s une absence attribuable \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience.\n[3] Il semble que la Commission n\u2019a pas statu\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement sur la plainte, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le plaignant devait \u00e9puiser les proc\u00e9dures de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui \u00e9taient normalement ouvertes. Cette proc\u00e9dure est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la LCDP.\n[4] La Commission a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de statuer sur la plainte et de la renvoyer aux fins d\u2019une enqu\u00eate en 2013. Lors de la r\u00e9ception du Rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la Commission a demand\u00e9, le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2015, que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte, car la Commission \u00e9tait convaincue que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019instruction de celle-ci \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\nIII. Cadre juridique\n[5] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la LCDP est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n41 (1) sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\n[\u2026]\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n[\u2026]\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[6] Dans le jugement Canada (C.C.D.P.) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada (re : Vermette) (1996) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/139 (C.F. 1re inst.) (jugement Vermette), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, au motif qu\u2019il existait un autre recours appropri\u00e9. Dans une opinion incidente (voir les paragraphes 22-23), la Cour a conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41e), tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, accordait un droit de fond qui pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 devant le Tribunal:\n[28] Pourquoi devrait-il s\u2019agir l\u00e0 de la mani\u00e8re dont la Cour doit interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41e)? Parce que le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an comme un droit de fond dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les personnes contre qui une plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, mais la Commission ne statue pas sur les plaintes en examinant les droits absolus de chacun. Toutefois, les tribunaux d\u00e9terminent effectivement des droits de fond en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 des examens complets en vertu des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 50, et en concluant si une plainte est fond\u00e9e, ou non, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9s, en vertu de l\u2019article 53.\n[29] Un examen \u00e9quitable et complet est un processus dans le cadre duquel les personnes vis\u00e9es par une plainte b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient chacune de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019opposer une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re aux arguments de la partie plaignante. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, dans une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre priv\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du pouvoir des tribunaux, car ces derniers, dans le cours normal d\u2019un litige, entendent (ou lisent) tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, in\u00e9vitablement plus, et sont davantage au courant des circonstances que la Commission dans son r\u00f4le pr\u00e9liminaire [\u2026]\n[7] Dans le jugement Vermette, la Cour a poursuivi en concluant que, bien que la Commission puisse rendre une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire et proc\u00e9durale en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41e), celle-ci \u00ab n\u2019est pas coul\u00e9e dans le bronze \u00bb, mais peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e en fonction de ce qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le Tribunal, est appropri\u00e9 lors de l\u2019examen auquel il proc\u00e8de en vue de d\u00e9terminer le droit de fond de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de jouir du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9lai de prescription (voir le paragraphe 33).\n[8] La Cour a pris le soin de souligner que, m\u00eame s\u2019il peut sembler que le Tribunal examinait la d\u00e9cision de la Commission rendue en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41e), la t\u00e2che qui lui incombait essentiellement \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer les droits de fond de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et ce, dans les circonstances o\u00f9 la plaignante avait \u00ab d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00bb sa plainte (voir le paragraphe 34).\n[9] Le jugement Vermette a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire I.L.W.U. (Section maritime locale 400 c. Oster [2002] 2 RCF 430 (d\u00e9cision Oster). Dans la d\u00e9cision Oster, la Cour a fait observer que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) conf\u00e8re effectivement le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 la Commission de proroger le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vu pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte, ce qui est incompatible avec l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41 cr\u00e9e le droit de ne pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate dans des circonstances pr\u00e9cises. Dans la d\u00e9cision Oster, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019exercice par la Commission de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) \u00e9tait susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et que l\u2019approche sur les \u00ab droits de fond \u00bb dans le jugement Vermette \u00e9tait incompatible avec l\u2019existence de cette comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire :\n[33] [\u2026] la position que le juge Muldoon a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vermette [Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 radio-Canada (re : Vermette) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11865 (CF), 120 F.T.R. 81 (C.F. 1re inst.)] et que le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pourrait \u00e0 mon avis donner lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat plut\u00f4t anormal : la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pourrait r\u00e9viser une prorogation de d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9e par la Commission et confirmer cette prorogation et, pourtant, cette m\u00eame d\u00e9cision de la Commission pourrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen par le Tribunal quant au fond si celle-ci lui soumettait la plainte. En l\u2019absence de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives indiquant clairement que le Parlement souhaitait ce r\u00e9sultat, j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que telle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas son intention.\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que le Tribunal a commis une erreur en disant qu\u2019il avait comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires du syndicat, compte tenu de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas demander devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire par laquelle la Commission a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi, le syndicat ne pouvait tout simplement pas exercer l\u2019autre recours qu\u2019il a choisi, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas soulever devant le Tribunal les m\u00eames questions qu\u2019il aurait pu soulever dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[10] Outre la d\u00e9cision Oster, dans laquelle il s\u2019est vu refuser l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 41 de la LCDP \u00e0 un certain nombre d\u2019autres reprises.\n[11] Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Wall c. Conseil d\u2019\u00e9ducation de Kitigan Zibi, 1997 CanLII 1251 (TCDP), la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question au motif que la Commission n\u2019avait pas pris certaines mesures pr\u00e9liminaires n\u00e9cessaires. En particulier, on a soutenu que la Commission n\u2019avait pas express\u00e9ment v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si la plaignante devait \u00eatre tenue d\u2019\u00e9puiser le m\u00e9canisme interne d\u2019appel, et que cette d\u00e9marche \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41a) de la LCDP, tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00ab [\u2026] sur la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue du pouvoir du Tribunal, si pouvoir il y a, d\u2019examiner les actions ou les omissions de la Commission pendant l\u2019instruction de la plainte devant le tribunal \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[12] Dans l\u2019affaire Wall, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 que \u00ab [\u2026] il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner la conduite ou les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission ni m\u00eame de v\u00e9rifier si des d\u00e9cisions n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] Il a poursuivi en concluant que sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e, \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re la LCDP, et en particulier le paragraphe 50 (1) qui pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal examine l\u2019objet de la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9.\n[13] Dans l\u2019affaire Dumont c. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2001 CanLII 38314 (TCDP), il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1998 relativement \u00e0 des faits survenus en 1996. Le Tribunal a fait observer que :\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a de toute \u00e9vidence exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 41 (1) e) de la Loi et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter la plainte de M. Dumont, m\u00eame si celle-ci semble porter sur des faits survenus plus d\u2019un an avant son d\u00e9p\u00f4t. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[14] Il a ensuite conclu ce qui suit :\n[7] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d\u00e9cide d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 41 (1) e) de la Loi. Cette question rel\u00e8ve exclusivement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le fait que la Commission ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter la plainte de M. Dumont, sans apparemment avoir re\u00e7u d\u2019expos\u00e9s de TJG, a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une certaine importance. Toutefois, il y a lieu de noter que rien n\u2019indique que TJG ait tent\u00e9 de soumettre \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de traiter la plainte de M. Dumont [\u2026] [Renvois omis, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[15] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont toutes les deux fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2002 CanLII 45934 (TCDP), dans laquelle les intim\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 le rejet des plaintes en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celles-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. En particulier, dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis, les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que cette disposition leur conf\u00e9rait le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de prescription d\u2019un an, que le Tribunal a d\u00e9fini en tant qu\u2019affirmation d\u2019un \u00ab droit fondamental \u00bb. Dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les jugements Vermette et Oster dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et il a ensuite conclu qu\u2019\u00ab [\u2026] on ne peut interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 41(1) comme accordant aux intim\u00e9s des droits fondamentaux suppl\u00e9mentaires que peut d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal \u00bb (paragraphe 7).\n[16] Dans l\u2019affaire Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2002 CanLII 61852 (TCDP), confirm\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs en 2004 CF 81, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 l\u2019argument invoqu\u00e9 par la Commission selon lequel le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour se pencher sur les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission au sens de l\u2019article 41 (voir les paragraphes 5-6).\n[17] Dans l\u2019affaire Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 TCDP 31 (d\u00e9cision Telus), le Tribunal, en rejetant l\u2019objection fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), a fait observer que la personne qui est l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte qu\u2019elle estime avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e hors d\u00e9lai peut soulever ce point devant la Commission. Cependant, rien n\u2019indiquait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait fait valoir devant la Commission ses pr\u00e9tentions quant au caract\u00e8re tardif de la plainte dont il \u00e9tait l\u2019objet (voir les paragraphes 49-50).\n[18] Dans l\u2019affaire Warman c. Northern Alliance, 2009 TCDP 10, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit : \u00ab [\u2026] une d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander une enqu\u00eate au Tribunal, lorsque les actes contest\u00e9s ont eu lieu plus d\u2019un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) et au paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi. Donc, compte tenu des circonstances, le Tribunal doit tenir une audience \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 8).\nIV. Analyse\n[19] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant qui s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur la p\u00e9riode allant du 22 avril 2008 au 15 juillet 2008 devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es pour non-conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elles sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte par plus d\u2019une ann\u00e9e. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les d\u00e9cisions dans les affaires Oster et Leonardis peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es pour soutenir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner sa requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que ces d\u00e9cisions se distinguent de la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\n[traduction] \u00ab Les d\u00e9cisions Oster et Leonardis se distinguent de la pr\u00e9sente affaire parce que dans ces deux affaires, les intim\u00e9s ont contest\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision explicite de la CCDP de proroger le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e). Aucune d\u00e9cision de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par la CCDP dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et c\u2019est pourquoi ces affaires ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00bb. (R\u00e9ponse, paragraphe 2)\n[20] Au contraire, dans les cas o\u00f9 la Commission ne fournit pas une justification raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une prorogation du d\u00e9lai en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le jugement Vermette s\u2019applique. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission n\u2019a pas fourni une telle justification dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais rendu de d\u00e9cision. [\u2026] \u00bb. Ni le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ni la d\u00e9cision renvoyant la plainte au Tribunal n\u2019indiquent express\u00e9ment que la Commission a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an. Il appert \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que la CCDP ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9e sur la question lorsqu\u2019elle a fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune d\u00e9cision de la CCDP que le Tribunal peut examiner de fa\u00e7on certaine et, de plus, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la CCDP, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pouvait pas demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question (Avis de requ\u00eate, paragraphe 14; R\u00e9ponse, paragraphe 3).\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne \u00e0 juste titre que le jugement Vermette, qui renferme une opinion incidente approuvant la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 41, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 ni infirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cependant, il serait raisonnable de dire que la Cour, dans l\u2019affaire Oster, a adopt\u00e9 une approche diff\u00e9rente concernant l\u2019application par le Tribunal de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e). Dans le jugement Vermette, la Cour a conclu que l\u2019article 41 cr\u00e9ait des droits de fond auxquels le Tribunal pouvait donner effet si la preuve et les circonstances justifiaient un tel r\u00e9sultat. Dans l\u2019affaire Oster, la Cour souligne que la nature discr\u00e9tionnaire de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) est incompatible avec l\u2019id\u00e9e que cette disposition devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme si elle accordait le droit de ne pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. De surcro\u00eet, dans l\u2019affaire Oster, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e dans le jugement Vermette pouvait donner lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat anormal, en ce sens que la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision de la CCDP fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 41 pouvait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et d\u2019un examen quant au fond par le Tribunal.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9e laisse entendre que les deux d\u00e9cisions n\u2019entrent pas en conflit. La d\u00e9cision Oster r\u00e9git plut\u00f4t les cas o\u00f9 la CCDP a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), et le jugement Vermette s\u2019applique lorsque la Commission n\u2019a rendu aucune d\u00e9cision en application de cette disposition, ou n\u2019a fourni aucune justification raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la prorogation du d\u00e9lai. Cette suppos\u00e9e distinction n\u2019est toutefois pas \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les jugements eux-m\u00eames. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que les d\u00e9cisions Vermette et Oster constituent des jugements contradictoires qui ne peuvent \u00eatre concili\u00e9s en l\u2019absence ou l\u2019existence dans chacun des cas d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission sur le fondement de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41.\n[23] En premier lieu, rien n\u2019indique dans le jugement Vermette que les conclusions du juge Muldoon se limitaient aux situations dans lesquelles la Commission avait omis de fournir une justification raisonnable, ou de rendre une d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019\u00ab une prorogation du d\u00e9lai \u00bb. Au contraire, dans le jugement Vermette, la Cour a express\u00e9ment envisag\u00e9 non pas une, mais deux d\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019article 41 : la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision serait rendue par la Commission, mais serait de nature pr\u00e9liminaire et proc\u00e9durale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un pouvoir \u00ab ni formel ni ultime \u00bb; la seconde d\u00e9cision serait rendue par le Tribunal et trancherait sur le fond la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on qui n\u2019est pas convenable \u00ab du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9lai de prescription fix\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (voir les paragraphes 26-29, 33-34). Par cons\u00e9quent, le raisonnement dans le jugement Vermette ne pr\u00e9sume aucunement de l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[24] En second lieu, il n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait clair si les conclusions du juge Gibson dans le jugement Oster \u00e9taient subordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission de proroger le d\u00e9lai. Il est vrai que le dossier dans l\u2019affaire Oster indiquait clairement que la Commission avait pris en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), ce qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de statuer sur la plainte. La Cour a soulign\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision aurait pu faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, susceptible de donner lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat anormal dans le cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal statuerait sur la m\u00eame question. Cependant, la conclusion principale dans la d\u00e9cision Oster est sans doute le d\u00e9saccord du juge Gibson avec la Cour dans le jugement Vermette quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019article 41 conf\u00e8re des droits de fond qui peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s devant le Tribunal. Si la Cour avait r\u00e9ellement cru que l\u2019affaire Vermette \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses faits, compte tenu de l\u2019absence pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e d\u2019une d\u00e9cision fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) dans cette affaire, le juge Gibson aurait pu l\u2019indiquer. Pourtant, on ne trouve aucune indication en ce sens dans le jugement.\n[25] En somme, aucun des jugements ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le r\u00e9sultat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent si la Commission avait rendu, ou non, des motifs clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e). La dichotomie factuelle propos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour concilier les d\u00e9cisions Oster et Vermette est insoutenable.\n[26] Une meilleure interpr\u00e9tation de ces jugements, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans le pass\u00e9, est que ceux-ci entrent en conflit quant \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019article 41 et aux pouvoirs qu\u2019il conf\u00e8re ou non au Tribunal. Ainsi, dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis, le Tribunal a conclu que la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Oster avait \u00ab conclu diff\u00e9remment \u00bb par rapport \u00e0 la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Vermette, et elle a choisi de suivre la d\u00e9cision Oster portant que l\u2019on ne peut interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 41(1) comme accordant des droits fondamentaux suppl\u00e9mentaires que peut d\u00e9terminer le Tribunal (paragraphe 7). Notamment, le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les conclusions de droit du juge Gibson dans l\u2019affaire Oster, et non sur l\u2019existence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission sur le fondement de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e). En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, dans l\u2019affaire Leonardis, la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision expresse en vertu de cette disposition qui \u00e9tait \u00ab contest\u00e9e \u00bb, mais que ce d\u00e9tail ne figure pas dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, et encore moins est-il invoqu\u00e9 comme motif pour suivre le raisonnement dans l\u2019affaire Oster, contrairement \u00e0 celui de l\u2019affaire Vermette.\n[27] L\u2019affaire Leonardis n\u2019est pas la seule d\u00e9cision dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu que les jugements Vermette et Oster sont inconciliables. Dans l\u2019affaire Cremasco, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que le jugement Vermette \u00ab [\u2026] a \u00e9t\u00e9 invalid\u00e9 par les faits ult\u00e9rieurs \u00bb et qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le raisonnement dans la d\u00e9cision Oster (voir le paragraphe 45).\n[28] Comme les membres instructeurs du Tribunal dans les d\u00e9cisions Leonardis et Cremasco, je crois que les jugements Vermette et Oster adoptent deux approches interpr\u00e9tatives diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 41 qui ne peuvent \u00eatre concili\u00e9es, et que l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Oster est \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier.\n[29] Il importe \u00e9galement de souligner que le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de dichotomie factuelle entre les jugements Vermette et Oster n\u2019est pas compatible avec le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 41. L\u2019affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (en vue de contourner la d\u00e9cision Oster), selon laquelle la Commission n\u2019a apparemment \u00ab jamais rendu de d\u00e9cision \u00bb en ce qui concerne le d\u00e9lai, embrouille l\u2019issue centrale du processus d\u00e9cisionnel \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019article 41, \u00e0 savoir, une d\u00e9cision par la Commission de statuer ou non sur la plainte. Le paragraphe 41(1) impose \u00e0 la Commission l\u2019obligation expresse de statuer sur les plaintes, \u00e0 moins que la Commission estime que l\u2019une des circonstances \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es s\u2019applique : \u00ab Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime [\u2026] \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] Par cons\u00e9quent, si elle d\u00e9cide de statuer sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits, la Commission a, \u00e0 tout le moins, implicitement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser une plainte en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e).\n[30] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) habilite la Commission \u00e0 statuer sur les plaintes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s \u00ab [\u2026] tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances [...] \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque une interpr\u00e9tation disjonctive de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e), comme si ce libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyait une \u00e9tape distincte dans le cadre du processus d\u00e9cisionnel \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019article 41, qui est dissoci\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de \u00ab statuer sur la plainte \u00bb. Si elle est accueillie, il semblerait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es que, dans certains cas, la Commission rend des motifs qui traitent express\u00e9ment d\u2019une prorogation de d\u00e9lai, alors que dans d\u2019autres cas elle ne le fait pas. Cependant, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu, et refuse en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de se lancer dans un examen du processus d\u00e9cisionnel administratif de la Commission afin d\u2019aborder les incidences de ces modifications.\n[31] Dans les affaires Wall, Dumont, Cremasco, Telus, et Warman, le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas attard\u00e9 sur l\u2019absence ou l\u2019existence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission rendue en vertu de chaque alin\u00e9a du paragraphe 41(1). Il s\u2019en est plut\u00f4t remis \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission de \u00ab statuer \u00bb sur la plainte.\n[32] Dans l\u2019affaire Wall, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(a) de la LCDP, le Tribunal a clairement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission ni de v\u00e9rifier si des d\u00e9cisions n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues.\n[33] Dans l\u2019affaire Dumont, il semble y avoir eu un certain degr\u00e9 d\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la Commission avait rendu une d\u00e9cision formelle en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de proroger le d\u00e9lai. Le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab de toute \u00e9vidence \u00bb une telle d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, sans apparemment avoir re\u00e7u d\u2019expos\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cependant, cette question relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, duquel l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans l\u2019affaire Dumont, ne s\u2019est apparemment pas pr\u00e9value. Le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner \u00ab [\u2026] la fa\u00e7on dont \u00bb la Commission d\u00e9cide d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e).\n[34] Dans l\u2019affaire Cremasco, le Tribunal s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on semblable, soulignant que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires, compte tenu de l\u2019exercice par la Commission de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41.\n[35] Dans l\u2019affaire Telus, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que \u00ab [d]e toute \u00e9vidence, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 la plainte irrecevable, ayant, dans un premier temps, charg\u00e9 une personne d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur la plainte et, dans un second temps, l\u2019ayant d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 47). Apr\u00e8s avoir fait remarquer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait le droit de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e0 la Commission sur le d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif de la plainte, le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que rien dans le dossier n\u2019indiquait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait fait valoir cet argument devant la Commission. Le Tribunal a finalement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e).\n[36] Au bout du compte, la raison pour laquelle la Commission d\u00e9cide de \u00ab statuer sur \u00bb une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 41 n\u2019influe pas sur la fa\u00e7on dont le Tribunal exerce sa propre comp\u00e9tence; l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment pertinent du point de vue du Tribunal est que la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49. Les d\u00e9cisions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 41, ainsi que sur l\u2019article 49, peuvent certainement \u00eatre contest\u00e9es, mais la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est l\u2019instance devant laquelle il convient de soulever de telles contestations, au moyen d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[37] Ce partage des responsabilit\u00e9s clairement d\u00e9fini entre la Cour, la Commission et le Tribunal, tel qu\u2019adopt\u00e9 dans la LCDP et la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, est pleinement pris en compte dans le jugement Oster, et c\u2019est pourquoi il constitue l\u2019approche \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier. Le Tribunal n\u2019a simplement pas comp\u00e9tence pour appliquer l\u2019article 41.\n[38] \u00c0 cela s\u2019ajoute la m\u00eame r\u00e9serve que l\u2019on trouve dans des d\u00e9cisions similaires o\u00f9 le Tribunal a d\u00e9clin\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des objections fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 41 : le Tribunal demeure comp\u00e9tent pour traiter de questions ayant trait \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le d\u00e9lai dans l\u2019instance a des r\u00e9percussions sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience, (Grover c. Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2009 TCDP 1, paragraphe 42, confirm\u00e9 par Grover c. Canada (P.G.), 2010 CF 320 (d\u00e9cision Grover-CF)). Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle a subi un pr\u00e9judice en raison du d\u00e9lai du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, et que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] la preuve \u00e0 ce sujet figure dans le Rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, qui est joint comme pi\u00e8ce B dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\u201d Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, certaines personnes qui auraient fait preuve de discrimination, lors de l\u2019entrevue par l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, ont dit qu\u2019elles n\u2019arrivaient pas \u00e0 se rappeler de certains faits en cause, et que leur souvenir d\u2019autres faits s\u2019\u00e9tait estomp\u00e9. Une autre personne ne se souvenait m\u00eame pas d\u2019avoir travaill\u00e9 avec le plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, le d\u00e9lai a min\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de se d\u00e9fendre elle-m\u00eame contre l\u2019all\u00e9gation qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate (voir la R\u00e9ponse, paragraphe 6).\n[39] Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover-CF, la Cour a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, pour obtenir un sursis d\u2019instance, il faut faire la preuve d\u2019\u00ab [\u2026] un pr\u00e9judice important \u00bb et que lorsque ce pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sulterait de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie d\u2019obtenir une audience \u00e9quitable, cette partie doit \u00eatre dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour justifier ses pr\u00e9tentions (voir le paragraphe 30). La Cour a d\u00e9crit l\u2019\u00e9valuation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Grover de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[31] [\u2026] Le Tribunal a entendu de nombreux t\u00e9moignages portant sur la question des d\u00e9lais et de la m\u00e9moire d\u00e9faillante des t\u00e9moins Il a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins et a tir\u00e9 des inf\u00e9rences dans le but de d\u00e9terminer si le pr\u00e9judice subi \u00e9tait \u00ab assez important pour nuire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience \u00bb (Blencoe, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 104), justifiant ainsi le rejet des plaintes. [\u2026]\n[40] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve de pr\u00e9judice, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur des d\u00e9clarations figurant dans le Rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur relatant des conversations avec trois t\u00e9moins potentiels. Bien que le Tribunal puisse sans doute accepter une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire (alin\u00e9a 50(3)c))\u2014en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un ou\u00ef-dire double\u2014la valeur probante limit\u00e9e d\u2019une telle preuve est manifeste, surtout dans le contexte d\u2019une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rejeter sommairement une all\u00e9gation de discrimination. Il n\u2019y a aucune fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9valuer la v\u00e9racit\u00e9, l\u2019exactitude, la port\u00e9e ou les cons\u00e9quences possibles sur l\u2019examen des d\u00e9clarations qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur selon le pr\u00e9sent dossier de requ\u00eate. En outre, l\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur le pr\u00e9judice, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit d\u2019un argument distinct reposant sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 que dans la r\u00e9ponse, et la requ\u00eate initiale a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019article 41. Les observations concernant le pr\u00e9judice sont insuffisantes pour permettre un examen ad\u00e9quat de cet argument en tant que motif de refus distinct.\n[41] Pour l\u2019ensemble des motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nle 30 d\u00e9cembre 2016",

Introduction\n[1] Le plaignant est un r\u00e9sident canadien et s\u2019identifie comme un arabe et un musulman. Il a immigr\u00e9 au Canada depuis la Syrie avec sa famille en 1987 alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de huit ans. Il est maintenant un m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en radiologie. Il est le chef du service d\u2019imagerie diagnostique \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Bluewater Health \u00e0 Sarnia (Ontario). Il all\u00e8gue, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture d\u2019un service offert par la ligne a\u00e9rienne intim\u00e9e.\n[2] En juin 2011, Air Canada a refus\u00e9 de laisser M. Almalki monter \u00e0 bord d\u2019un vol de London (Ontario) \u00e0 Toronto. Il s\u2019agissait du premier segment d\u2019un voyage de deux vols \u00e0 destination de Vancouver avec sa famille. M. Almalki soutient que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience lui a caus\u00e9 de la douleur et de la souffrance, une atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 celle de sa famille, de m\u00eame que de l\u2019humiliation pour lui et sa famille. Il all\u00e8gue de plus qu\u2019il a subi d\u2019importantes pertes de revenus en raison du fait qu\u2019Air Canada a par la suite refus\u00e9 de le laisser monter \u00e0 bord de certains vols \u00e0 destination du Nouveau-Brunswick o\u00f9 il allait p\u00e9riodiquement fournir des services comme suppl\u00e9ant.\n[3] Air Canada d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Almalki. Elle soutient que le nom de M. Almalki figurait sur une liste de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine et que la Transportation Security Administration (la \u00ab TSA \u00bb) des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis lui a ordonn\u00e9 de ne pas laisser M. Almalki monter \u00e0 bord des vols en question. Selon Air Canada, elle n\u2019avait pas le choix de refuser les services \u00e0 M. Almalki.\n[4] Dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration pour l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Almalki a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour la divulgation de documents qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision vise cette requ\u00eate.\nII. Habituellement, une partie devrait demander directement \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie la divulgation de documents\n[5] En guise de question pr\u00e9liminaire, le Tribunal aimerait attirer l\u2019attention des parties sur la pratique habituelle concernant la divulgation. En vertu du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), les parties sont tenues de divulguer et de produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires si de nouveaux faits ou de nouvelles questions ou formes de redressement sont soulev\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (EDP) ou la r\u00e9plique d\u2019une autre partie ou si une partie constate une lacune dans la divulgation ant\u00e9rieure.\n[6] On s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une partie demande tout d\u2019abord directement \u00e0 l\u2019autre de divulguer et de produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ne figurent pas dans la liste de documents dans son EDP. Le Tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que les parties ne recourent au processus de requ\u00eate que dans les cas o\u00f9 la divulgation soul\u00e8ve un litige apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une telle demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e directement \u00e0 la partie.\n[7] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que [traduction] \u00ab [u]n nombre important de documents parmi ceux demand\u00e9s, sinon tous, \u00e9taient demand\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans le dossier de requ\u00eate du plaignant. \u00bb Depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 toutes les demandes de divulgation et a fourni d\u2019autres documents suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[8] Si c\u2019est le cas, le Tribunal s\u2019immisce inutilement dans le processus de divulgation entre les parties. De plus, le plaignant n\u2019a pas choisi de fournir une r\u00e9plique aux arguments qu\u2019Air Canada a fournis en r\u00e9ponse de sorte que le Tribunal ignore quelles demandes de divulgation, s\u2019il en est, sont encore en litige. Il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties de pr\u00e9senter les demandes de divulgation directement l\u2019une \u00e0 l\u2019autre et de pr\u00e9senter des requ\u00eates en divulgation devant le Tribunal uniquement lorsque les parties sont en d\u00e9saccord.\nIII. Les demandes de divulgation du plaignant\n[9] Dans sa requ\u00eate, le plaignant demande \u00e0 Air Canada la divulgation des huit \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n[traduction]\nLes documents du centre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle (CSO) relativement \u00e0 la tentative du plaignant de s\u2019enregistrer pour les vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011, y compris les communications entre les agents du CSO sur les lieux et en dehors des lieux, les rapports produits par le syst\u00e8me automatis\u00e9 qui identifiaient le plaignant sur la liste des \u00ab personnes pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es \u00bb et les registres de toute communication avec la Transportation Security Administration des \u00c9tats-Unis.\nTous les documents que d\u00e9tient l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant le plaignant, y compris l\u2019historique des d\u00e9placements, les registres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs, les registres de r\u00e9servations, les registres de cartes d\u2019embarquement, les registres de noms de passagers, les registres de syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9valuation de passagers, les profils et les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des clients d\u2019Air Canada.\nLes graphiques, les plans de vol, les autorisations de survol ou les autres renseignements concernant les itin\u00e9raires pr\u00e9vus et r\u00e9els des vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011, y compris tout document ou communication interne mentionnant les itin\u00e9raires pr\u00e9cis survolant les \u00c9tats-Unis (plus particuli\u00e8rement pour les vols AC7702 et AC1173).\nToute note de service ou tout document interne concernant les obligations et proc\u00e9dures d\u2019Air Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour prendre la d\u00e9cision de ne pas laisser le plaignant monter \u00e0 bord des vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011.\nTous les protocoles, toutes les proc\u00e9dures, politiques et tous les manuels de formation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les proc\u00e9dures de contr\u00f4le de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement en vigueur le 18 juin 2011, ainsi que les confirmations selon lesquelles les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u une formation sur le traitement des passagers en ce qui concerne les proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les droits de la personne ou les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles.\nLes dossiers de toutes les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e9guant la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur ou la religion, concernant l\u2019application par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de listes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement, ainsi que les renseignements concernant l\u2019issue de ces plaintes.\nFormuler et fournir des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant les lois, les r\u00e8glements, les ententes ou les autres r\u00e8gles du Canada ou des \u00c9tats-Unis sur lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e pour refuser de laisser monter le plaignant \u00e0 bord de l\u2019avion le 18 juin 2011.\nFournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chaque t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel.\n[10] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2015, Air Canada a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 chacune des huit demandes ci-dessus. J\u2019examinerai chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment ci-apr\u00e8s. Il y a toutefois lieu de souligner qu\u2019Air Canada a indiqu\u00e9 que certains renseignements ou documents \u00e9taient des renseignements ou documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle les a retenus parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 les divulguer. \u00c0 l\u2019occasion de la derni\u00e8re t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence sur la gestion de l\u2019instance concernant ce sujet, tenue le 7 juillet 2015, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 les autres parties de ces restrictions et a indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019avocat du plaignant pouvait souhaiter obtenir de la TSA des observations concernant ces demandes de divulgation des renseignements ou documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9. L\u2019avocat du plaignant s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 aviser la TSA au plus tard le 14 juillet 2015 et \u00e0 demander une r\u00e9ponse pour le 24 ao\u00fbt 2015. Malheureusement, l\u2019avocat du plaignant n\u2019a avis\u00e9 la TSA que le 24 ao\u00fbt 2015. La TSA a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 envoyer une r\u00e9ponse au plus tard le 8 octobre 2015 si elle souhaitait pr\u00e9senter des observations. \u00c0 la connaissance du Tribunal, la TSA n\u2019a envoy\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9ponse avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 8 octobre 2015 ni \u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nIV. Les principes applicables \u00e0 la divulgation\n[11] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve. Pour avoir cette possibilit\u00e9, les parties doivent obtenir, entre autres choses, la divulgation de renseignements qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents et qui sont en la possession ou sous les soins de la partie adverse avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. Outre les faits et les questions en litige pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation de documents permet \u00e0 chaque partie de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et, par cons\u00e9quent, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audition. Pour cette raison, s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement soulev\u00e9es par les parties dans l\u2019affaire, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 en vertu des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles (voir Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22; Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 [Guay]; Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28; Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6).\n[12] Toutefois, la demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre incertaine ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb. Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise. De plus, la demande ne devrait pas obliger un \u00e9tranger ou une partie au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43).\n[13] Il y a \u00e9galement lieu de noter que la divulgation de documents qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents ne signifie pas que ces renseignements seront admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire ou qu\u2019une importance significative leur sera accord\u00e9e dans le processus d\u00e9cisionnel (voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\nV. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[14] Les huit \u00e9l\u00e9ments demand\u00e9s par M. Almalki sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s. Sous chaque demande se trouve la r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada, tir\u00e9e de sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2015. Sous la r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada se trouve la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Il convient de noter que le plaignant a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9plique aux arguments d\u2019Air Canada. Bien que l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e aux parties, le plaignant n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de r\u00e9plique au Tribunal, faisant en sorte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile pour le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer les objections d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la divulgation (une question qui sera discut\u00e9e plus loin).\n1. Les documents du centre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle (CSO) relativement \u00e0 la tentative du plaignant de s\u2019enregistrer pour les vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011, y compris les communications entre les agents du CSO sur les lieux et en dehors des lieux, les rapports produits par le syst\u00e8me automatis\u00e9 qui identifiaient le plaignant sur la liste des \u00ab personnes pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es \u00bb et les registres de toute communication avec la Transportation Security Administration des \u00c9tats-Unis.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] Il est interdit \u00e0 Air Canada de divulguer les documents demand\u00e9s puisqu\u2019ils sont directement vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition de renseignements d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 en vertu des lois susmentionn\u00e9es [voir ci-dessous]. Ainsi, la divulgation desdits renseignements constituerait une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale et des organismes gouvernementaux, y compris la TSA, sanctionneraient Air Canada. Nous croyons comprendre que l\u2019avocat du plaignant s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 signifier les documents de sa requ\u00eate \u00e0 la TSA. Toutefois, malgr\u00e9 de nombreuses demandes, Air Canada n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u une copie de la correspondance destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la TSA.\n[15] Dans les arguments relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 le R\u00e8glement canadien de 2012 sur la s\u00fbret\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne, DORS\/2011\u2011318 (RCSA), indiquant qu\u2019il interdisait \u00e0 Air Canada de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande de divulgation. L\u2019article 235.1 du RCSA est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 comme suit :\nIl est interdit \u00e0 toute personne autre que le ministre de communiquer des renseignements d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 qui sont cr\u00e9\u00e9s ou utilis\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente section, sauf si la communication est exig\u00e9e par la loi ou est n\u00e9cessaire pour satisfaire aux dispositions de la Loi relatives \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne, aux exigences r\u00e9glementaires ou aux exigences d\u2019une directive d\u2019urgence, ou pour en faciliter la conformit\u00e9.\n[16] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement que certains r\u00e8glements des \u00c9tats-Unis restreignent aussi la divulgation des renseignements demand\u00e9s. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, Air Canada cite les dispositions \u00a7\u00a71520.5 \u00e0 1520.7 du titre 49 du Code of Federal Regulations qui portent sur la protection de renseignements de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e9licats, la port\u00e9e du r\u00e8glement et les parties vis\u00e9es. \u00c0 ce dernier \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019un transporteur a\u00e9rien \u00e9tranger est une personne assujettie \u00e0 la partie 1520.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[17] Conform\u00e9ment aux principes applicables \u00e0 la divulgation, je conclus que les documents demand\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre pertinents.\n[18] Il est malheureux que l\u2019avocat du plaignant n\u2019ait pas r\u00e9pondu aux objections, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait clair si les objections sont valables. Premi\u00e8rement, en ce qui concerne le r\u00e8glement canadien cit\u00e9, le RCSA semble autoriser express\u00e9ment la divulgation dans les cas o\u00f9 elle est \u00ab exig\u00e9e par la loi \u00bb ce qui inclurait, vraisemblablement, une ordonnance du Tribunal. En ce qui a trait aux dispositions am\u00e9ricaines cit\u00e9es, le Tribunal ne voit pas clairement quelle disposition dans \u00a71520.5 ou \u00a71520.7 restreint v\u00e9ritablement la divulgation de renseignements de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e9licats. Le TCDP est-il li\u00e9 par des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives \u00e9trang\u00e8res dans la mesure o\u00f9 il ne peut rendre une ordonnance visant la divulgation de tels renseignements? Le Tribunal aurait examin\u00e9 des arguments sur ces points puisqu\u2019ils sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9s de nouveau dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[19] En l\u2019absence d\u2019observations en r\u00e9plique et de tout argument contraire, le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019Air Canada concernant la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments demand\u00e9s.\n2. Tous les documents que d\u00e9tient l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant le plaignant, y compris l\u2019historique des d\u00e9placements, les registres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs, les registres de r\u00e9servations, les registres de cartes d\u2019embarquement, les registres de noms de passagers, les registres de syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9valuation de passagers, les profils et les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des clients d\u2019Air Canada.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] Le registre de noms de passagers du plaignant est joint en ONGLET 1 et \u00e9tait inclus dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada. Air Canada v\u00e9rifie si d\u2019autres documents qui ne sont pas des documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 existent qui comprendraient des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant et elle produira ces documents pertinents, si elle les trouve.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[20] Le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a divulgu\u00e9 certains documents et s\u2019engage \u00e0 divulguer des documents pertinents suppl\u00e9mentaires si elle en trouve. De plus, le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de r\u00e9plique contestant le caract\u00e8re satisfaisant de cette r\u00e9ponse.\n3. Les graphiques, les plans de vol, les autorisations de survol ou les autres renseignements concernant les itin\u00e9raires pr\u00e9vus et r\u00e9els des vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011, y compris tout document ou communication interne mentionnant les itin\u00e9raires pr\u00e9cis survolant les \u00c9tats-Unis (plus particuli\u00e8rement pour les vols AC7702 et AC1173).\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] Comme les vols en cause ont eu lieu il y a plus de quatre ans, Air Canada v\u00e9rifie \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle l\u2019existence de documents qui ne sont pas des documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 ou des documents qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des itin\u00e9raires des vols en cause et produira ces documents, si elle les trouve. Il est interdit \u00e0 Air Canada de divulguer des documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 en raison des lois susmentionn\u00e9es. La demande de divulgation de documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale pertinente.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[21] Air Canada a indiqu\u00e9 dans son EDP que les deux vols en question \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme survolant les \u00c9tats-Unis et qu\u2019ils sont (\u00e9taient) par cons\u00e9quent assujettis aux r\u00e8glements des \u00c9tats-Unis \u00bb.\n[22] Le Tribunal conclut que les renseignements demand\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre pertinents. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 Air Canada de divulguer les renseignements demand\u00e9s qui indiquent si les itin\u00e9raires a\u00e9riens de ces vols faisaient r\u00e9ellement en sorte que l\u2019a\u00e9ronef p\u00e9n\u00e9trait dans l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien am\u00e9ricain, ou subsidiairement, de divulguer tout document qui peut indiquer les raisons pour lesquelles les vols pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre dans le ressort am\u00e9ricain, \u00e0 moins que cette divulgation ne soit interdite par les autorit\u00e9s l\u00e9gislatives susmentionn\u00e9es. Si cette divulgation est interdite, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise les dispositions du r\u00e8glement susmentionn\u00e9 qui interdit la divulgation de documents.\n4. Toute note de service ou tout document interne concernant les obligations et proc\u00e9dures d\u2019Air Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour prendre la d\u00e9cision de ne pas laisser le plaignant monter \u00e0 bord des vols AC7702 et AC1173 le 18 juin 2011.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] Les documents demand\u00e9s ne peuvent pas, en vertu des lois susmentionn\u00e9es, \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s en raison de leur nature d\u00e9licate relative \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9. La divulgation desdits renseignements mettrait le public en danger et entra\u00eenerait pour Air Canada des sanctions de la part d\u2019organismes gouvernementaux, y compris la TSA.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[23] Selon la r\u00e9ponse ci-dessus, de tels documents semblent exister et je conclus qu\u2019ils pourraient \u00eatre pertinents. Il est malheureux que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui pourraient l\u2019assujettir \u00e0 des sanctions gouvernementales. De plus, il est not\u00e9 que le l\u00e9gislateur a, en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi, conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal le pouvoir de prendre des mesures pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 d\u2019une question touchant \u00ab la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique \u00bb ou si \u00ab la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne \u00bb est mise en danger. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal serait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la raison pour laquelle cette demande ne pourrait pas obtenir de r\u00e9ponse compte tenu de l\u2019article 52. Cependant, n\u2019ayant re\u00e7u aucun argument en r\u00e9plique de la part de l\u2019avocat du plaignant, le Tribunal ne rend \u00e0 ce moment-ci aucune ordonnance concernant cette demande.\n5. Tous les protocoles, toutes les proc\u00e9dures, politiques et tous les manuels de formation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les proc\u00e9dures de contr\u00f4le de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement en vigueur le 18 juin 2011 ainsi que les confirmations selon lesquelles les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u une formation sur le traitement des passagers en ce qui concerne les proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les droits de la personne ou les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] La formation relative \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de vol [Deemed High Profile (DHP)] est fournie dans le cadre d\u2019un cours de formation de base. De plus, la formation relative \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de vol doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9e tous les deux ans. La formation relative \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de vol est incluse dans trois modules intitul\u00e9s Security in Your Workplace [la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans votre milieu de travail], qui font partie d\u2019un cours de base qui est obligatoire pour tous les nouveaux employ\u00e9s. La formation est \u00e9galement incluse dans deux autres cours, intitul\u00e9s Security a Way of Life [la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, un mode de vie] et Security and Operational Awareness [s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sensibilisation op\u00e9rationnelle].

Formuler et fournir des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant les lois, les r\u00e8glements, les ententes ou les autres r\u00e8gles du Canada ou des \u00c9tats-Unis sur lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e pour refuser de laisser monter le plaignant \u00e0 bord de l\u2019avion le 18 juin 2011.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019Air Canada a indiqu\u00e9 les lois et r\u00e8glements pertinents. Les documents de la TSA sur lesquels Air Canada s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sont express\u00e9ment class\u00e9s comme des documents d\u00e9licats relatifs \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1520.7(b) du titre 49 du Code of Federal Regulations et, par cons\u00e9quent, Air Canada ne peut les divulguer sans le consentement de la TSA. De plus, lesdits documents renferment des pr\u00e9cisions relatives aux proc\u00e9dures confidentielles en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dont la divulgation constituerait une menace pour la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019aviation nationale.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[26] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun argument en r\u00e9plique qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re satisfaisant de la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance concernant cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\n8. Fournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chaque t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel.\nLa r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada\n[traduction] Air Canada n\u2019a pas encore choisi le t\u00e9moin ou les t\u00e9moins qu\u2019elle appellera. Toutefois, le t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu portera surtout sur la principale question de savoir si, dans son application des proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, Air Canada a ou non fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif interdit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du plaignant. La preuve d\u2019Air Canada montrera que les proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es \u00e9galement et sans exception \u00e0 chaque passager du vol en cause et qu\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a donc pas fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif interdit.\nLa d\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[27] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun argument en r\u00e9plique qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re satisfaisant de la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance concernant cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Il est cependant pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 que lorsque les t\u00e9moins individuels seront identifi\u00e9s, une divulgation en temps opportun sera faite aux autres parties conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) et au paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

La demande de divulgation\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente demande de divulgation survient dans le contexte d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Air Canada par M. Yaffa. M. Yaffa all\u00e8gue que la ligne a\u00e9rienne a fait preuve de discrimination contre lui en le soumettant \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique, de sa couleur et de sa religion, \u00e0 six occasions diff\u00e9rentes entre mars et juin 2010. Par suite des actes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada, M. Yaffa soutient avoir souffert de d\u00e9pression, d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u2019insomnie et d\u2019une diminution de son estime de lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels il sollicite une indemnit\u00e9.\n[2] Par voie de requ\u00eate, Air Canada demande que M. Yaffa et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) produisent tous les documents concernant une autre plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Yaffa contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ASFC \u00bb). Cette plainte concerne des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits en mars 2009, avant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, et all\u00e8gue que des agents de l\u2019ASFC ont cibl\u00e9 M. Yaffa et l\u2019ont injustement soumis \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le secondaire \u00e0 l\u2019A\u00e9roport international Pearson en raison de sa race, de sa couleur et de sa religion. Dans la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC, M. Yaffa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience lui a caus\u00e9 des [traduction] \u00ab blessures morales et un stress significatif \u00bb et que par la suite, il avait voyag\u00e9 \u00e0 trois occasions apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident et qu\u2019\u00e0 chaque fois [traduction] \u00ab les sc\u00e9narios lui revenaient \u00e0 l\u2019esprit et il devenait nerveux, entre autres choses \u00bb.\nII. Les motifs de la demande\n[3] Dans le cadre du processus de divulgation continue, qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure (voir Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22), M. Yaffa a fourni \u00e0 Air Canada un formulaire de plainte contre l\u2019ASFC qu\u2019il avait auparavant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le formulaire de plainte, Air Canada a demand\u00e9 la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Air Canada soutient que les circonstances donnant lieu \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC et la plainte contre elle semblent semblables dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles portent toutes deux sur des incidents qui se sont produits \u00e0 des a\u00e9roports canadiens, dans le contexte de contr\u00f4les secondaires et par suite desquels le plaignant all\u00e8gue des pr\u00e9judices psychologiques. De surcro\u00eet, dans les deux plaintes, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que les incidents ont eu lieu en raison de sa race, de sa couleur et de sa religion.\n[4] Air Canada ajoute que l\u2019incident vis\u00e9 par la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC et les pr\u00e9judices psychologiques all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui y sont associ\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, d\u2019un point de vue chronologique, de seulement une ann\u00e9e les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contre Air Canada. De plus, M. Yaffa all\u00e8gue des pr\u00e9judices psychologiques semblables caus\u00e9s par Air Canada et sollicite une indemnit\u00e9 pour lesdits pr\u00e9judices, nonobstant le fait que les pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9existants et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels il peut avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC en vertu d\u2019un r\u00e8glement.\n[5] Du point de vue d\u2019Air Canada, afin de conna\u00eetre la preuve contre elle et d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre, elle doit obtenir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la question de savoir si M. Yaffa cherche \u00e0 obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada pour des pr\u00e9judices psychologiques qui existaient auparavant et qui sont attribuables \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019ASFC. En outre, toute reconnaissance de responsabilit\u00e9, modalit\u00e9 de r\u00e8glement, y compris l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Yaffa pour des pr\u00e9judices psychologiques, sont importantes pour la pr\u00e9sente instance, compte tenu de la ressemblance de la nature des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre Air Canada et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que cherche \u00e0 obtenir M. Yaffa.\n[6] En vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP, les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve. Pour avoir cette possibilit\u00e9, les parties doivent obtenir, entre autres choses, la divulgation de documents qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents et qui sont en la possession ou sous les soins de la partie adverse avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. Outre les faits et les questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation de documents permet \u00e0 chaque partie de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et, par cons\u00e9quent, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audition. Pour ce motif, s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, questions ou formes de redressement soulev\u00e9es par les parties dans l\u2019affaire, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 en vertu des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (voir Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22).\n[7] La plainte \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avant que la Commission ne d\u00e9cide si elle justifiait une instruction devant le Tribunal. M. Yaffa et la Commission ont confirm\u00e9 que les seuls documents demand\u00e9s en leur possession et qui se rapportent \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC sont le formulaire de plainte initiale qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 Air Canada et les documents concernant la m\u00e9diation de la plainte et les modalit\u00e9s de r\u00e8glement. Ils nient l\u2019existence de tout rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ou de tout autre document demand\u00e9 par Air Canada. M. Yaffa et la Commission s\u2019opposent tous deux \u00e0 la divulgation des documents relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation et au r\u00e8glement puisqu\u2019\u00e0 leur avis, ils ne pourraient pas \u00eatre pertinents pour les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ils soutiennent de plus que les documents sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et, \u00e0 ce titre, leur production ne peut \u00eatre forc\u00e9e en l\u2019absence de circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[8] L\u2019ASFC a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des arguments \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de divulgation d\u2019Air Canada. Elle convient avec M. Yaffa et la Commission que les documents relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation et au r\u00e8glement ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. L\u2019ASFC fait valoir que les documents n\u2019ont pas de valeur probante et qu\u2019Air Canada n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 un lien suffisant entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[9] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nIV. Le cadre juridique\n[10] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision d\u00e9coule du paragraphe 50(4) de la LCDP qui interdit au Tribunal d\u2019admettre en preuve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le privil\u00e8ge invoqu\u00e9 est le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements.\n[11] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sable Offshore Energy Inc. c. Ameron International Corp., 2013 CSC 37 (\u00ab Sable \u00bb), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019importance des r\u00e8glements amiables pour le syst\u00e8me judiciaire et l\u2019importance du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements pour l\u2019administration de la justice :\n[11] Le r\u00e8glement amiable permet aux parties de r\u00e9soudre leur diff\u00e9rend de fa\u00e7on mutuellement satisfaisante sans faire augmenter le co\u00fbt et la dur\u00e9e d\u2019une poursuite judiciaire pour les personnes concern\u00e9es et le public. Le juge en chef adjoint Callaghan a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ainsi les avantages du r\u00e8glement amiable dans Sparling c. Southam Inc. (1988), 1988 CanLII 4694 (ON SC), 66 O.R. (2d) 225 (H.C.J.) :\n[traduction] ... en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les tribunaux pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent sans exception les r\u00e8glements amiables. En d\u2019autres termes, il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant \u00e0 ce que les parties en viennent \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un principe qui sert g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties en ce qu\u2019il leur \u00e9pargne les frais de l\u2019instruction des questions en litige, tout en r\u00e9duisant la pression exerc\u00e9e sur un syst\u00e8me de tribunaux provinciaux d\u00e9j\u00e0 surcharg\u00e9\u2026\n[12] Le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements favorise la conclusion de r\u00e8glements. Comme le confirme l\u2019abondance de la jurisprudence \u00e0 ce sujet, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Comme pour les autres privil\u00e8ges g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption prima facie d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9, mais cette pr\u00e9somption souffre d\u2019exceptions [traduction] \u00ab quand les consid\u00e9rations de justice que pose l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le requi\u00e8rent \u00bb (Rush & Tompkins Ltd. c. Greater London Council, [1988] 3 All E.R. 737 (H.L.), p. 740).\n[12] Le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que les parties seront davantage susceptibles de parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement si elles sont confiantes d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part que le contenu de leurs n\u00e9gociations ne sera pas divulgu\u00e9. Les n\u00e9gociations en vue d\u2019un r\u00e8glement sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement final intervienne ou non, et le privil\u00e8ge relatif au r\u00e8glement s\u2019\u00e9tend au contenu de tout r\u00e8glement intervenu (Sable, aux paragraphes 13, 17 et 18).\n[13] La Cour supr\u00eame reconna\u00eet dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sable que le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements souffre d\u2019exceptions, lorsque \u00ab [traduction] un int\u00e9r\u00eat public oppos\u00e9 l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 favoriser le r\u00e8glement amiable \u00bb. Parmi ces int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s, on a retenu la pr\u00e9vention de la surindemnisation du demandeur (Sable, au paragraphe 19).\nV. L\u2019analyse\n[14] En vertu de l\u2019article 50 de la LCDP, le Tribunal doit donner aux parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019interdiction d\u2019admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le droit relatif aux privil\u00e8ges.\n[15] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il est imp\u00e9rieux d\u2019obtenir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la question de savoir si le plaignant cherche \u00e0 obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 pour des pr\u00e9judices psychologiques qui existaient auparavant et qui sont attribuables \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019ASFC, une conduite ant\u00e9rieure aux incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que toute admission de responsabilit\u00e9, modalit\u00e9 de r\u00e8glement, y compris l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 vers\u00e9e pour les pr\u00e9judices psychologiques, seraient importantes pour la pr\u00e9sente instance. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019omission de produire les documents en cause portera atteinte \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense.\n[16] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, puisque le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements est un privil\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, les documents demand\u00e9s relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation et au r\u00e8glement (\u00ab les documents relatifs au r\u00e8glement \u00bb) font l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption prima facie d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9. La partie qui conteste la pr\u00e9somption a le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019une exception s\u2019applique au privil\u00e8ge g\u00e9n\u00e9rique (Sable, au paragraphe 19; voir aussi Dos Santos v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 2005 BCCA 4, au paragraphe 19 (\u00ab Dos Santos \u00bb); Brown v. Cape Breton (Regional Municipality), 2011 NSCA 32, aux paragraphes 59 \u00e0 61 (\u00ab Brown \u00bb)).\n[17] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la revendication du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements, l\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque l\u2019exception autorisant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de documents n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir la surindemnisation d\u2019une partie. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos dans lequel la cour a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation d\u2019un accord de r\u00e8glement dans une poursuite en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurance.\n[18] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant recevait des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme en vertu d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance collective aupr\u00e8s de la compagnie d\u2019assurance Sun Life du Canada, \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait souscrit au travail. La clause de subrogation de la police pr\u00e9voyait que si l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e9tait caus\u00e9e par la n\u00e9gligence d\u2019un tiers, 75 % du recouvrement net de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour perte de revenus dans toute action devaient \u00eatre vers\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019assureur, dans la mesure des prestations pay\u00e9es ou payables (Dos Santos, au paragraphe 4).\n[19] Le plaignant a intent\u00e9 une action contre le conducteur de la voiture qui avait bless\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse et le conducteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu responsable \u00e0 100 %. Il y a ensuite eu m\u00e9diation des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats avec l\u2019assureur du conducteur, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (\u00ab I.C.B.C. \u00bb). Sun Life soutenait qu\u2019elle avait le droit de voir les documents qui sous-tendaient le r\u00e8glement conclu par m\u00e9diation afin de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer la somme pay\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la perte de revenus (Dos Santos, aux paragraphes 6 et 7).\n[20] La Cour d\u2019appel de la C.\u2011B. \u00e9tait d\u2019accord et a statu\u00e9 que le plaignant avait clairement mis en cause les droits de subrogation de Sun Life en vertu de la police d\u2019assurance invalidit\u00e9. Les documents \u00e9taient donc pertinents et n\u00e9cessaires. Selon les mots de la cour, [traduction] \u00ab [e]n l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il existe un lien clair entre les sommes que le plaignant demande \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse et les sommes que le plaignant peut avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ues dans le cadre du r\u00e8glement avec I.C.B.C. \u00bb (Dos Santos, aux paragraphes 25 et 33).\n[21] L\u2019application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire devant le Tribunal soul\u00e8ve plusieurs difficult\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8rement, et de la plus grande importance, la pertinence et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de divulguer les documents relatifs au r\u00e8glement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos \u00e9taient \u00e9videntes. La partie demanderesse, Sun Life, avait le droit contractuel d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toute somme d\u2019argent que recevait le plaignant du tiers n\u00e9gligent ou pour le compte de ce dernier. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Air Canada, ne poss\u00e8de aucun droit contractuel d\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sommes d\u2019argent que le plaignant a re\u00e7ues de l\u2019ASFC.\n[22] Deuxi\u00e8mement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos, il est clair que la partie demanderesse sollicite la divulgation de modalit\u00e9s de r\u00e8glement qui r\u00e9gissent les paiements \u00e0 un tiers \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du m\u00eame incident. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien qu\u2019un chevauchement soit possible, il n\u2019est pas clair si les incidents donnant lieu \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC sont les m\u00eames que ceux donnant lieu \u00e0 la plainte contre Air Canada. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la pr\u00e9sente affaire comporte des incidents multiples. Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait aucun chevauchement et que les incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC soient tout \u00e0 fait ant\u00e9rieurs aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre Air Canada.\n[23] L\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, comporte une situation factuelle qui s\u2019apparente plus \u00e0 celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, la plaignante avait subi deux blessures distinctes au genou caus\u00e9es par deux d\u00e9fendeurs diff\u00e9rents. Elle a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la deuxi\u00e8me blessure et le d\u00e9fendeur vis\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re demande a demand\u00e9 la divulgation de l\u2019accord de r\u00e8glement et la correspondance connexe. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse a suivi l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos dans la mesure o\u00f9 il reconnaissait que le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements souffrait des exceptions et que l\u2019exception \u00e9vidente qui pouvait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 cette affaire comportait le risque de la double indemnisation (Brown, au paragraphe 72). Toutefois, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, la Cour a refus\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner la divulgation \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019instance \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la pertinence des communications relatives au r\u00e8glement n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question pour le juge du proc\u00e8s (Brown, aux paragraphes 73 et 74).\n[24] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, l\u2019insistance de la cour sur la preuve de l\u2019indivisibilit\u00e9 des deux blessures suscite un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier. S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Athey c. Leonati, 1996 CanLII 183 (CSC), la cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, lorsqu\u2019il existe plus d\u2019une cause pour la blessure d\u2019un plaignant, la cour doit tout d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer la question de savoir si la blessure est divisible ou indivisible (Brown, au paragraphe 15). Elle a ensuite conclu comme suit :\n[traduction]\n[23] La pertinence est une question de droit (R. c. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (CSC), [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, au paragraphe 18). Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au juge en chambre \u00e9taient extr\u00eamement limit\u00e9s. Ils sont loin de fournir \u00e0 la cour suffisamment de renseignements pour se prononcer sur la question de savoir si les blessures au genou de Mme Brown \u00e9taient indivisibles au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Athey. Sans \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui pourrait appuyer une telle d\u00e9termination, il n\u2019est pas possible de dire si les renseignements relatifs au r\u00e8glement concernant l\u2019accident de 2004 \u00e9taient pertinents. En ordonnant la divulgation, le juge en chambre a commis une erreur de droit. [\u2026]\n[25] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019audience n\u2019a pas encore commenc\u00e9 et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 concernant les pr\u00e9judices psychologiques du plaignant. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si un ou plusieurs des trois vols ult\u00e9rieurs mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC ont co\u00efncid\u00e9 effectivement avec l\u2019un des cinq vols mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte contre Air Canada.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet dans ses arguments en r\u00e9plique que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019existence d\u2019un chevauchement n\u2019est pas claire \u00bb entre les incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans les deux plaintes, de m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas clair si le plaignant a continu\u00e9 de ressentir les effets psychologiques des incidents donnant lieu \u00e0 la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC lorsqu\u2019il prenait un vol d\u2019Air Canada. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait ensuite valoir ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nAucune des parties oppos\u00e9es n\u2019ont fourni d\u2019arguments ou d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9liminer cette pr\u00e9occupation pas plus qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont confirm\u00e9 que les trois incidents de voyage ult\u00e9rieurs mentionn\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas avec Air Canada, \u00e0 des dates pertinentes pour la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[27] Bien que l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit int\u00e9ressante, la difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve est qu\u2019elle laisse entendre que les autres parties ont le fardeau de montrer que les documents relatifs au r\u00e8glement ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Toutefois, comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, il incombe \u00e0 la partie demanderesse d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019exception au privil\u00e8ge qui, selon la pr\u00e9somption, s\u2019applique \u00e0 des documents relatifs aux r\u00e8glements. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve suffisante pour r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption, le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements s\u2019applique (Brown, au paragraphe 23).\n[28] Cette situation peut changer apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience et l\u2019interrogatoire et le contre-interrogatoire du plaignant. Si, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, un fondement de preuve suffisant \u00e9tait \u00e9tabli, le Tribunal serait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner une requ\u00eate en divulgation semblable qui ferait ressortir la pertinence et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des documents compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la possibilit\u00e9 de double indemnisation ou de surindemnisation pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[29] Dans le pass\u00e9, le Tribunal a fait preuve de vigilance pour emp\u00eacher la possibilit\u00e9 de double indemnisation, comme l\u2019illustrent des d\u00e9cisions comme Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, 2011 TCDP 12 (\u00ab Palm \u00bb). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de r\u00e8glements avec deux employeurs intim\u00e9s dans une affaire institu\u00e9e contre trois syndicats intim\u00e9s. Il y a cependant lieu de souligner que le Tribunal a conclu que les plaintes, bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identiques, comportaient \u00ab des ressemblances frappantes \u00bb (Palm, au paragraphe 8). Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il ressortait clairement d\u2019un examen des plaintes qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient toutes fond\u00e9es sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de deux mois dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement de travail (Palm, au paragraphe 7).\n[30] Par contraste en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la possibilit\u00e9 de chevauchement factuel demeure sp\u00e9culative. La comparaison des deux plaintes dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019indique pas la m\u00eame \u00ab interd\u00e9pendance \u00bb que dans le cas des cinq plaintes en cause dans Palm. Cela ne veut pas dire que la plainte contre l\u2019ASFC et la plainte contre Air Canada n\u2019ont pas de lien. Cela signifie plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape actuelle des proc\u00e9dures, il n\u2019est simplement pas possible de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue ou le degr\u00e9 de leur interd\u00e9pendance avec le degr\u00e9 de certitude qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements. L\u2019arr\u00eat Dos Santos fait lui-m\u00eame une mise en garde contre un crit\u00e8re trop peu exigeant, puisque les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre public qui sous-tendent le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements sont imp\u00e9rieuses.\n[31] La surindemnisation est une possibilit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais sa r\u00e9alit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie avant que le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements puisse \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9. Le Tribunal a invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 envisager une disjonction de la pr\u00e9sente instruction, afin de permettre l\u2019examen approfondi de la possibilit\u00e9 de chevauchement entre les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC et les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une audience consacr\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9. Dans le cas et au moment o\u00f9 la responsabilit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, les questions relatives \u00e0 la divulgation concernant la surindemnisation auraient pu alors \u00eatre examin\u00e9es et d\u00e9cid\u00e9es selon un solide fondement de preuve. Elles auraient m\u00eame pu \u00eatre r\u00e9solues de fa\u00e7on consensuelle (Sable, au paragraphe 25). Malgr\u00e9 les avantages apparents de cette approche, les parties ont refus\u00e9 l\u2019invitation du Tribunal.\n[32] La requ\u00eate en production des documents relatifs au r\u00e8glement est par les pr\u00e9sentes rejet\u00e9e, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits de la partie requ\u00e9rante de la pr\u00e9senter de nouveau apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une preuve probante concernant la nature des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre Air Canada et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, concernant le degr\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de tout chevauchement entre : a) les incidents vis\u00e9s par les deux plaintes; b) les pr\u00e9judices psychologiques all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qu\u2019ils auraient caus\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Analyse 23\nVI. Ordonnance 28\nI. Contexte\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente affaire vise trois plaintes dat\u00e9es du 30 mars 2012 que M. Bruce Beattie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 4 avril 2012. La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire les plaintes sur une base consolid\u00e9e le 1er octobre 2013, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] M. Beattie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes pour le compte de Mme Joyce Beattie, de Mme Jenelle Brewer et de M. James Louie qui, selon les plaintes, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 du fait de leur race, origine nationale ou ethnique, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer certains documents relatifs \u00e0 des terres dans le Registre des terres de r\u00e9serve (le registre) \u00e9tabli en vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi sur les Indiens (la Loi), contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. En vertu de lettres dat\u00e9es du 30 et du 31 ao\u00fbt 2012, Mme Beattie, Mme Brewer et M. ont autoris\u00e9 M. Beattie \u00e0 les repr\u00e9senter aux fins des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[3] M. Louie, qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 28 mars 2015, \u00e9tait un membre de la Bande indienne d\u2019Okanagan et un Indien inscrit en vertu de la Loi. Mme Brewer est \u00e9galement une Indienne inscrite en vertu de la Loi et membre de la Bande indienne d\u2019Okanagan. Mme Beattie, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de M. Beattie, est \u00e9galement une Indienne inscrite en vertu de la Loi, mais n\u2019est pas membre de la Bande indienne d\u2019Okanagan.\n[4] M. Beattie, qui n\u2019est pas un Indien, a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un plaignant dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, en plus d\u2019agir en qualit\u00e9 de mandataire ou repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie et de sa succession, de Mme Brewer et de Mme Beattie. Les plaintes ne pr\u00e9cisent pas le fondement de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e qu\u2019il aurait subie.\n[5] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 8 mai 2015, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ni ne compara\u00eetrait \u00e0 l\u2019audience apr\u00e8s sa participation initiale.\n[6] Mme Beattie a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin. Mme Brewer n\u2019a pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Aucun membre de la famille de M. Louie n\u2019a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. M. Beattie a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants et a aussi comparu comme t\u00e9moin pour les plaignants. Aucune preuve \u00e9crite n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au Tribunal pour confirmer le pouvoir de M. Beattie de repr\u00e9senter la succession de M. Louie.\n[7] Le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle conf\u00e8re au Canada un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif exclusif concernant \u00ab [l]es Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9 (connu sous Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada avant mai 2011 et sous Affaires autochtones et Nord Canada depuis novembre 2015) est le minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada responsable de l\u2019administration de la Loi, y compris le r\u00e9gime des terres de r\u00e9serve en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur la gestion des terres. Mm Sheila Craig, gestionnaire, Modernisation des terres, Terres et d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique au bureau r\u00e9gional de la Colombie-Britannique, a comparu comme t\u00e9moin pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nII. Dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables\n[8] Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives suivantes sont pertinentes pour la pr\u00e9sente affaire et sont reproduites ci-apr\u00e8s, \u00e0 savoir le paragraphe 3(1) et l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2(1)a), les paragraphes 18(1), 20(1) et (2), les articles 21, 24, les paragraphes 28(1) et (2) et le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi.\nLoi canadienne sur les droits de la personne\nMotifs de distinction illicite\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\nRefus de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou d\u2019h\u00e9bergement\n5 Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\nLoi sur les Indiens\n2 (1) Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nministre Le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien.

Les faits\nA. Chronologie\n[9] Les terres vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont situ\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9serve indienne d\u2019Okanagan \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de Vernon (Colombie-Britannique) et incluent deux parcelles d\u00e9crites comme \u00e9tant le lot 170\u20111 et le lot 175, bloc 4, plan 93082 AATC sur la r\u00e9serve indienne no 1. Le conseil de la r\u00e9serve indienne no 1 a attribu\u00e9 ces terres \u00e0 M. Louie et le ministre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019attribution comme le d\u00e9montrent les certificats de possession (CP) enregistr\u00e9s dans le registre en vertu de l\u2019article 20 de la Loi.\n[10] En juin 2007, M. Louie et Mme Beattie ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de bail minist\u00e9riel en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du lot 170\u20111. En janvier 2008, ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de bail minist\u00e9riel en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du lot 175. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 ces demandes en se fondant sur diverses interpr\u00e9tations qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 des exigences auxquelles, selon lui, les demandes ne r\u00e9pondaient pas. Parmi les exigences qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il y avait les suivantes : celle selon laquelle un bail devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande, sinon le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel devait fournir une justification \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9; celle selon laquelle le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel ne pouvait louer son propre terrain qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait en vertu d\u2019un certificat de possession, sans se constituer en soci\u00e9t\u00e9; celle qui reconnaissait les enfants adopt\u00e9s l\u00e9galement, mais non les enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume.\n[11] Le rejet de ces demandes a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des plaintes en vertu de la LCDP en 2008 et en 2010 et dans lesquelles M. Beattie a agi comme mandataire des plaignants. Apr\u00e8s des audiences devant le Tribunal, toutes ces plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es justifi\u00e9es sur le fond, m\u00eame si une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une des d\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. Finalement, toutes ces d\u00e9cisions portant sur des baux minist\u00e9riels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenues, au fond, puisque le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu discrimination. Les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal relatives aux affaires concernant les plaintes de 2008 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par l\u2019ancien membre Craig en 2011, 2012 et 2013 (Beattie et Louie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 2, 2012 TCDP 2, 2013 TCDP 17). J\u2019ai moi-m\u00eame rendu en 2014 les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal relatives aux affaires concernant les plaintes de 2010 (Beattie c. Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada, 2014 TCDP 1 et Beattie et Louie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2014 TCDP 7). Bien que les lots en cause dans ces affaires fussent les m\u00eames lots qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les affaires ant\u00e9rieures visaient toutes des baux minist\u00e9riels en vertu du paragraphe 58(3), contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui vise des baux priv\u00e9s, sans que la Couronne y soit partie. Parmi les interpr\u00e9tations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux plaintes, aucune ne se rapportait express\u00e9ment aux exigences pr\u00e9vues par la loi.\n[12] Par suite de ces d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a infirm\u00e9 certaines interpr\u00e9tations et r\u00e9vis\u00e9 des pratiques internes concernant l\u2019octroi de baux minist\u00e9riels. En outre, \u00e0 compter de juillet 2013, les politiques et les pratiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9 relativement aux terres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9es et modifi\u00e9es pour veiller, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 ce que la Politique et Directive sur les baux de titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel offre un processus permettant aux titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel de louer leurs terres. Les modifications n\u2019ont toutefois pas \u00e9limin\u00e9 l\u2019exigence selon laquelle la Couronne doit \u00eatre une partie au bail. Elles n\u2019ont pas non plus exig\u00e9 de changement \u00e0 la pratique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 exigeant le consentement de la Couronne avant qu\u2019un preneur puisse sous-louer ou c\u00e9der un bail. N\u00e9anmoins, au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2011, il y a eu une importante correspondance entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et M. Beattie et plusieurs \u00e9bauches de baux minist\u00e9riels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9es. Les parties n\u2019ont toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de s\u2019entendre \u00e0 propos d\u2019un bail minist\u00e9riel en vertu du paragraphe 58(3). Ainsi, dans la deuxi\u00e8me moiti\u00e9 de 2011, pendant que le Tribunal entendait les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures, M. Beattie a, pour le compte des plaignants, modifi\u00e9 son approche et mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les baux minist\u00e9riels pour conclure des baux en faveur de baux priv\u00e9s sans la Couronne.\n[13] M. Beattie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au registraire deux demandes d\u2019enregistrement dat\u00e9es du 25 juillet 2011. Les demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues le 27 juillet 2011. Chaque demande \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019un bail. Un bail, concernant le lot 170-1, d\u00e9signait M. Louie comme bailleur et Mme Beattie comme preneuse. L\u2019autre bail, concernant le lot 175, d\u00e9signait M. Louie comme bailleur et Mme Brewer comme preneuse. Les deux baux \u00e9taient dat\u00e9s du 25 juillet et entraient en vigueur le 1er ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[14] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 juillet 2011, M. Beattie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Sidney Restall, conseiller juridique aupr\u00e8s du minist\u00e8re de la Justice et l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que les plaignants avaient d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier comme bailleur, au lieu de la Couronne, dans le bail visant le lot 170\u20111.\n[15] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 2011, M. Restall a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beattie qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant d\u2019une exigence pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019enregistrement du bail conclu entre M. Louie et Mme Beattie et qui accompagnait la lettre de M. Beattie dat\u00e9e du 27 juillet 2011. M. Restall a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne connais pas d\u2019exigence selon laquelle un tel bail doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 par le ministre d\u2019AANC. \u00bb Il a conclu en \u00e9crivant ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019initiative que vous avez prise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du bail, je comprends qu\u2019aucune autre participation de la Couronne n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire. \u00bb\n[16] Dans une autre lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 2011, M. Restall a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beattie qu\u2019en ce qui concernait le lot 175, [traduction] \u00ab [l]e bail que vous avez fourni d\u00e9signe une partie diff\u00e9rente de la demande originale. La Couronne devra examiner la situation. La demande d\u2019enregistrement jointe est vraisemblablement pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[17] M. Beattie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019enregistrement de cession de bail, sign\u00e9e le 1er mars 2012, au Registre des terres indiennes. Dans le document, Mme Brewer \u00e9tait identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant la c\u00e9dante et Mme Beattie \u00e9tait identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant la cessionnaire et M. Louie a sign\u00e9 le document pour indiquer son consentement. La demande indique que la cession de bail avait pour but de c\u00e9der le bail entre M. Louie et Mme Brewer concernant le lot 175 et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le 7 mars 2012 ou aux environs de cette date.\n[18] La cession de bail contenait trois conditions. La condition A \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\n[traduction] A. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens, les lieux sont des terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit de la Bande indienne d\u2019Okanagan (ci\u2011apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00ab la bande \u00bb) dont la c\u00e9dante est membre et la pr\u00e9sente cession de bail n\u2019a aucun effet sur la qualit\u00e9 de terres de r\u00e9serve des lieux. De plus, la pr\u00e9sente cession de bail ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme diminuant ou touchant autrement le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de la bande de r\u00e9glementer ou d\u2019autrement r\u00e9gir l\u2019utilisation et l\u2019occupation des lieux.\n[19] La condition C de la cession indiquait ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Les parties pr\u00e9senteront la pr\u00e9sente cession de bail pour son enregistrement dans le Registre des terres indiennes au plus tard \u00e0 la date d\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente cession de bail. \u00bb\n[20] M. Beattie a transmis une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 mars 2012 \u00e0 Mme Fiona McFarlane, conseill\u00e8re juridique aupr\u00e8s du minist\u00e8re de la Justice. Il affirme qu\u2019il avait obtenu ce matin-l\u00e0 la confirmation que le Registre des terres indiennes \u00e0 Ottawa avait re\u00e7u la demande d\u2019enregistrement de la cession et demandait une r\u00e9ponse le m\u00eame jour donnant l\u2019assurance que l\u2019avocate n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 au Registre des terres indiennes de directives visant la suspension ou le report de l\u2019examen de la demande.\n[21] Mme McFarlane a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Beattie le 9 mars 2012. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que les plaignants seraient inform\u00e9s \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure des d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant le bail visant le lot 170-1, le bail visant le lot 175 et la cession du bail visant le lot 175. Mme McFarlane a not\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 disposait de deux baux concernant le lot 175 et dans lesquels le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent, soit un bail minist\u00e9riel conclu entre le ministre et M. Louie dat\u00e9 du 1er juin 2011 et un bail priv\u00e9, sans mention du ministre, conclu entre M. Louie et Mme Brewer, dat\u00e9 du 1er ao\u00fbt 2011. Mme McFarlane a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Beattie des \u00e9claircissements sur ce qu\u2019il souhaitait faire \u00e0 propos du lot 175.\n[22] M. Beattie a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme McFarlane le 9 mars 2012. Il a confirm\u00e9 que toutes les demandes ant\u00e9rieures (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les baux minist\u00e9riels) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soit remplac\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants ou rejet\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que les baux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9s aux plaignants. M. Beattie a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que le seul bail acceptable pour M. Louie concernant le lot 175 \u00e9tait le bail dat\u00e9 du 25 juillet\/1er ao\u00fbt 2011 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un bail priv\u00e9) et c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Brewer et dont la date d\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur \u00e9tait le 1er mars 2012. Il a de plus affirm\u00e9 que le seul bail acceptable pour M. Louie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du lot 170\u20111 \u00e9tait le bail dat\u00e9 du 25 juillet\/1er ao\u00fbt 2011 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un bail priv\u00e9 \u00e9galement). Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 27 mars 2012, M. Beattie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme McFarlane qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun bail en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du lot 170-1 depuis le 11 avril 2011 et qu\u2019aucun bail en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) n\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu pour le futur.\n[23] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les trois plaintes dat\u00e9es du 30 mars 2012 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission le 4 avril 2012. Les plaintes all\u00e9guaient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Louie, de Mme Brewer et de Mme Beattie du fait de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique (\u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens inscrits), en raison du refus de fournir un service habituellement destin\u00e9 au public, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, par suite du refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer leurs baux priv\u00e9s et la cession en vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi.\n[24] Par une lettre dat\u00e9e du 30 septembre 2013, M. Daryl Hargitt, registraire des terres, Gestion des terres et de l\u2019environnement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, a inform\u00e9 M. Beattie que les demandes d\u2019enregistrement visant les baux priv\u00e9s (et la cession de bail) ne pouvaient \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9es dans le registre parce que les baux n\u2019indiquaient pas Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du chef du Canada comme bailleur, n\u2019indiquaient pas la Couronne \u00e0 titre de partie et que l\u2019approbation du ministre n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie. M. Hargitt a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait uniquement trouver la demande d\u2019enregistrement de la cession de bail de mars 2012, mais non la cession elle-m\u00eame enregistr\u00e9e au registre. Il a de plus soutenu que le bail priv\u00e9 conclu entre M. Louie et Mme Beattie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas acceptable pour l\u2019enregistrement et que la cession ult\u00e9rieure ne pourrait pas non plus \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e.\n[25] M. Beattie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Hargitt le 16 octobre 2013 demandant l\u2019annulation des demandes d\u2019enregistrement et l\u2019assurance que les demandes d\u2019enregistrement seraient effectu\u00e9es lorsque les documents d\u2019enregistrement seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de nouveau. Il a de plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que chacune des op\u00e9rations avait une [traduction] \u00ab valeur commercialisable de 200 000 $ \u00bb et que cette valeur serait r\u00e9clam\u00e9e au Canada si les enregistrements n\u2019\u00e9taient pas effectu\u00e9s.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u les baux priv\u00e9s et la cession de bail au moment o\u00f9 le Guide du Registre des terres indiennes de 2006 \u00e9tait en vigueur, mais le refus d\u2019enregistrer les documents a eu lieu lorsque le Guide de 2013 \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 en vigueur. En vertu du Guide de 2013, les Autochtones ne sont plus tenus d\u2019inclure leur identification raciale, nationale ou ethnique (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la Loi sur les Indiens) dans les nouvelles demandes d\u2019enregistrement.\nB. Le syst\u00e8me de gestion des terres\n[27] La Loi r\u00e9git toutes les transactions qui concernent les terres indiennes pour les Premi\u00e8res nations qui exercent leurs activit\u00e9s en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur la gestion des terres. Certaines Premi\u00e8res nations ont assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de leurs propres terres de r\u00e9serve en vertu de la Loi sur la gestion des terres des premi\u00e8res nations ou d\u2019autres arrangements conclus avec le Canada. Toutefois, la r\u00e9serve indienne d\u2019Okanagan o\u00f9 cette affaire s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e est administr\u00e9e par le Canada en vertu de la Loi.\n[28] En vertu de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est responsable de divers aspects de la gestion des terres de r\u00e9serve indiennes et de l\u2019enregistrement des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des terres de r\u00e9serve. Dans le cadre de cette responsabilit\u00e9, il administre le Syst\u00e8me d\u2019enregistrement des terres indiennes (SETI) et il a mis au point le Guide pour aider les membres de son personnel dans le processus d\u2019enregistrement des documents des op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres sur les r\u00e9serves. Le Guide actuel a remplac\u00e9 la version de 2006 en juillet 2013. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit : \u00ab Il doit \u00eatre tenu au minist\u00e8re un registre, connu sous le nom de Registre des terres de r\u00e9serve, o\u00f9 sont inscrits les d\u00e9tails concernant les certificats de possession et certificats d\u2019occupation et les autres op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres situ\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9serve. \u00bb Selon le Guide, \u00ab le registre sert \u00e0 consigner les documents relatifs aux terres attribu\u00e9es aux membres des bandes individuelles (bandes occupantes) et d\u2019autres op\u00e9rations \u00bb. Le registraire des terres indiennes (le registraire) est le titre de la personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour recevoir, traiter et consigner et enregistrer les documents.\n[29] Le Guide fournit les directives suivantes \u00e0 propos du SETI (et du registre) :\na) De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\ni) \u00ab On a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le SETI pour obtenir un registre fiable, informatis\u00e9 et consultable sur Internet des int\u00e9r\u00eats enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des terres de r\u00e9serve au Canada. \u00bb\nii) \u00ab Le SETI est un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents \u2014 il ne vise pas \u00e0 garantir le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l\u2019exactitude des documents qu\u2019il renferme, et il ne donne pas priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats en particulier [\u2026] \u00bb\niii) \u00ab Le SETI sert \u00e0 consigner les renseignements sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des terres de r\u00e9serve \u00bb tandis que \u00ab [l] e registre des terres dresse la liste des op\u00e9rations qui ont une incidence sur une parcelle de terre et indique la nature de l\u2019op\u00e9ration et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00bb et \u00ab [...] [u]ne fois enregistr\u00e9e, une op\u00e9ration ne peut \u00eatre supprim\u00e9e; elle demeure donc dans l\u2019historique de la r\u00e9serve ou de la parcelle, m\u00eame si elle est acquitt\u00e9e ou venue \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00bb.\niv) Le SETI \u00ab est guid\u00e9 par une s\u00e9rie de proc\u00e9dures interd\u00e9pendantes qui r\u00e9gissent l\u2019enregistrement des droits ou int\u00e9r\u00eats, des revendications d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et des avis d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une terre de r\u00e9serve \u00bb.\nv) \u00ab La plupart des syst\u00e8mes provinciaux servent \u00e0 enregistrer le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une terre.

Si le document n\u2019est pas acceptable pour l\u2019enregistrement, le bureau r\u00e9gional retourne l\u2019acte, la demande et tous les documents d\u2019appui pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s avec l\u2019acte;\nc. v\u00e9rifie que les documents requis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s;\nd. v\u00e9rifie que l\u2019acte r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.4 du Guide, notamment qu\u2019il est sign\u00e9 par la personne investie des pouvoirs d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s pertinents, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 8.4.1(10);\ne. dans le cas d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat, il s\u2019assure que les crit\u00e8res propres aux titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.4.5 du Guide sont respect\u00e9s;\nf. dans le cas d\u2019un bail, il s\u2019assure que les crit\u00e8res propres aux baux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.4.7 sont respect\u00e9s.\n- Le chapitre 9 du Guide fournit des directives aux membres du personnel d\u2019enregistrement concernant les motifs de refus d\u2019un enregistrement. Il pr\u00e9voit que le bureau r\u00e9gional ne doit pas enregistrer un acte si, selon l\u2019agent des terres qui examine la demande et les documents connexes, des crit\u00e8res ne sont pas respect\u00e9s. Dans un tel cas, les principaux motifs de refus d\u2019enregistrement d\u2019une demande sont les suivants : l\u2019acte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement ne r\u00e9pond pas aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le Manuel et l\u2019approbation du ministre n\u2019est pas fournie. Ces exigences apparaissaient tant dans l\u2019ancienne version que dans la version actuelle du Guide.\n- Le SETI est un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents. Il ne garantit pas le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l\u2019exactitude des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le registre. L\u2019enregistrement ne donne pas priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats en particulier (\u00e0 l\u2019exception des cas portant sur la cession d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat).\n- Si le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel souhaite louer son titre de possession, il peut le faire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Politique sur les baux de titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel de 2013. En vertu de cette politique, les titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel peuvent demander que le ministre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 conclue un bail en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi avec un \u00e9ventail de personnes, notamment des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, d\u2019autres Indiens ou le titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel lui\u2011m\u00eame et qu\u2019un tel droit de tenure \u00e0 bail puisse \u00eatre alors hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 pour fournir du financement en vue du d\u00e9veloppement de la terre.\n- L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu aux exigences de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi en cr\u00e9ant le SETI et en mettant sur pied un processus pour consigner les pr\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019attribution de la possession l\u00e9gale et \u00e0 d\u2019autres op\u00e9rations concernant les terres de r\u00e9serve. Dans le cas de l\u2019attribution d\u2019une terre de r\u00e9serve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 consigne la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande attribuant la possession l\u00e9gale \u00e0 un membre de la bande, ce qui a pour effet de cr\u00e9er un num\u00e9ro \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat. Les transactions ult\u00e9rieures concernant cet int\u00e9r\u00eat, comme un bail en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat, sont enregistr\u00e9es sous le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro. \u00c0 la page 34 des lignes directrices relatives aux inscriptions dans le Registre des terres indiennes, les fonctionnaires du minist\u00e8re sont tenus d\u2019enregistrer la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande attribuant la terre et de d\u00e9clarer que le consentement du ministre est exig\u00e9 avant qu\u2019un tel int\u00e9r\u00eat ne soit enregistr\u00e9. La page 43 des lignes directrices \u00e9num\u00e8re les quatre types de baux qui sont enregistr\u00e9s dans le registre des terres indiennes, soit les baux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de terres d\u00e9sign\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 53(1), les baux de titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 58(1)b) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de terres agricoles, les baux de bandes en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 58(1)c) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de terres agricoles et les baux de titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) \u00e0 des fins non agricoles.\nIV. Question pr\u00e9liminaire \u2013 Les plaintes constituent-elles uniquement une contestation ou une contestation incidente d\u2019un texte de loi et rien d\u2019autre et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9chappent-elles \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, selon la s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews?\n[31] Dans leurs observations \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les deux parties ont identifi\u00e9 cette question comme \u00e9tant une question pr\u00e9liminaire (\u00ab threshold issue \u00bb selon la description des plaignants, et \u00ab preliminary issue \u00bb selon la description de l\u2019intim\u00e9). Je suis d\u2019accord.\n[32] Murphy (Murphy c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 9) est une affaire qui visait une plainte en vertu de la LCDP concernant la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC) effectuait, en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la LIR) certains calculs d\u2019all\u00e9gement fiscal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs concernant le revenu d\u2019un groupe de femmes dans une situation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale. L\u2019ancien vice\u2011pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal Hadjis a conclu que la plainte n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Aux paragraphes 57 et 58 de sa d\u00e9cision, il a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[57] En somme, la source de la pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019est pas, en tout ou en partie, les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ARC, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un service destin\u00e9 au public ou non, mais plut\u00f4t exclusivement la loi elle-m\u00eame. Dans la d\u00e9cision Wignall c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Imp\u00f4t), 2003 CF 1280, au paragraphe 30, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 que le comportement de Revenu Canada ne pouvait pas \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP, alors qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t de la contestation d\u2019une disposition de la LIR.\n[58] Par cons\u00e9quent, si l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9, comme c\u2019est le cas en esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9coule seulement du libell\u00e9 de la LIR et non pas des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ARC, il ne d\u00e9coule pas de la fourniture de services de la part de l\u2019ARC, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de cet article ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9tablie.\n[33] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Murphy dans Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2011 CF 207 et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a maintenu la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans 2012 CAF 7. Une demande ult\u00e9rieure d\u2019autorisation de pourvoi \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e (dossier no 34706). En maintenant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 comme suit au paragraphe 6 :\n[6] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une attaque directe \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des articles 110.2 et 120.31 de la LIR, fond\u00e9e sur des consid\u00e9rations enti\u00e8rement extrins\u00e8ques \u00e0 celle\u2011ci. Or, ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu aux paragraphes 37 et 38 de la d\u00e9cision Forward c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2008 TCDP 5, \u00e0 propos d\u2019une plainte analogue mettant en cause des dispositions pr\u00e9cises de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9, L.R.C. 1985, ch. C\u201129, les contestations de cette nature \u00e9chappent au champ d\u2019application de la LCDP, parce qu\u2019elles visent les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en soi et rien d\u2019autre. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait observer en obiter dans Wignall c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), 2003 CF 1280, que l\u2019opposition en vertu de la LCDP \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 56(1)n) de la LIR \u00e9tait vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec si elle se fondait seulement sur ses cons\u00e9quences suppos\u00e9es discriminatoires pour le plaignant : seule une contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition offrait des chances de succ\u00e8s. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e dans ces d\u00e9cisions, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit pas la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser de plaintes contre une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir son paragraphe 40(1), qui autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes, et ses articles 5 \u00e0 14.1, qui d\u00e9finissent les \u00ab actes discriminatoires \u00bb pouvant faire l\u2019objet de celles\u2011ci).\n[34] J\u2019ai rendu la d\u00e9cision dans Matson (Matson et al c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 13). Dans Andrews (Andrews et al c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 21), la membre Marchildon a rendu la d\u00e9cision. Ces affaires portaient toutes deux sur des plaintes en vertu de la LCDP relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription du statut d\u2019Indien en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi. La membre Marchildon et moi-m\u00eame avons tous deux rejet\u00e9 les plaintes. Nos deux d\u00e9cisions ont suivi l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Murphy en concluant que les plaintes \u00e9taient exclusivement une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019article 6 de la Loi, et rien d\u2019autre.\n[35] Dans Matson, j\u2019ai \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 57 \u00e0 60 inclusivement :\n[57] Comme le pr\u00e9cisent la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un \u00ab Indien \u00bb et le paragraphe 5(5) de la Loi sur les Indiens, le droit et l\u2019inscription sont deux choses distinctes. Le droit est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable par la Loi sur les Indiens, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019inscription; tandis que l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens est le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un processus de demande aupr\u00e8s du registraire\/minist\u00e8re.\n[58] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019offre pas au public l\u2019avantage d\u2019un droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, ni les avantages tangibles et intangibles correspondants dont un tel droit peut \u00eatre assorti. C\u2019est la Loi sur les Indiens elle-m\u00eame qui offre l\u2019avantage du droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription et c\u2019est le l\u00e9gislateur qui a appliqu\u00e9 au public les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re de droit, pas l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce que ce dernier peut offrir en tant qu\u2019avantage ou service au public est le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription en vue de d\u00e9terminer si une personne doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e au registre des Indiens, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens. Pour ce faire, le registraire des Indiens re\u00e7oit les demandes d\u2019inscription, passe en revue les renseignements inscrits dans les demandes en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils sont complets et exacts, et \u00e9value ensuite les demandes afin de d\u00e9cider si le requ\u00e9rant satisfait aux dispositions de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re de droit d\u2019inscription. Les plaignants ne se plaignent pas de discrimination dans le cadre de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution, par l\u2019intim\u00e9, de l\u2019une quelconque de ces fonctions. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, le r\u00e9sultat de ce processus est le suivant : soit le requ\u00e9rant est ajout\u00e9 au registre des Indiens comme ayant droit au statut d\u2019Indien sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, soit il ne l\u2019est pas. Le traitement d\u2019une demande par le registraire, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite ci-dessus, est peut-\u00eatre un service, mais pas le statut, ou l\u2019absence de statut, qui en r\u00e9sulte.\n[59] Comme l\u2019indiquent clairement les observations des plaignants, ce n\u2019est pas la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite les demandes des plaignants que l\u2019on conteste en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t le droit des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019inscription, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. L\u2019unique source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. En passant en revue les demandes d\u2019inscriptions des plaignants, les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont rien fait de plus qu\u2019appliquer des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs cat\u00e9goriques \u00e0 des faits non contest\u00e9s. Toute contestation relative au processus d\u2019examen des demandes est en fait une contestation qui vise l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[60] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je r\u00e9pondrais donc \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question par l\u2019affirmative, et je conclus que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, soit l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et rien d\u2019autre.\n[36] Dans Andrews, la membre Marchildon a \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 110 et 111 :\n[110] Bien que mon raisonnement n\u2019entra\u00eene pas une d\u00e9cision en faveur du plaignant, je ne veux pas diminuer la souffrance que sa famille et lui ont subie en raison des politiques d\u2019\u00e9mancipation du gouvernement. M\u00eame si les plaignants ne peuvent pas contester les articles vis\u00e9s de la Loi sur les Indiens au titre de la Loi, ils peuvent choisir de le faire au titre de la Charte, au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec succ\u00e8s dans l\u2019affaire McIvor, par exemple, au sujet des alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le Tribunal n\u2019est cependant pas l\u2019instance appropri\u00e9e pour instruire la contestation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[111] Je r\u00e9pondrai donc ainsi aux questions A et B :\nA. Les plaintes portent-elles sur la prestation de services destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, ou sont-elles uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi?\nR\u00e9ponse : Les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi.\nB. Si les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi, la Loi permet-elle l\u2019instruction de telles plaintes?\nR\u00e9ponse : Non.\nCompte tenu de ces r\u00e9ponses, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 trancher les questions C et D :\nC. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\nD. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la discrimination prima facie n\u2019a pas eu lieu tel qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait justifiable au sens de la Loi?\n[37] Ces deux d\u00e9cisions ont fait, ensemble, l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 398 [en anglais seulement]. En rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu comme suit aux paragraphes 59 \u00e0 62 inclusivement :\n[traduction] [59] Une contestation de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle cette formule est appliqu\u00e9e est une contestation de la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants all\u00e8guent que les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens portant sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont discriminatoires. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019application des dispositions imp\u00e9ratives de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 constitue une mesure d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi, m\u00eame si le texte de loi pr\u00e9voit un avantage. C\u2019est le texte de loi qui refuse l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019avantage, non l\u2019organisme gouvernemental.\n[60] \u00c0 mon avis, les conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Forward sont tout aussi applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Au paragraphe 54, se reportant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Forward, le Tribunal a conclu que la citoyennet\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un service parce que l\u2019unique source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait le libell\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatif de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision Forward a adopt\u00e9 la remarque incidente dans McKenna selon laquelle Druken \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision erron\u00e9e (Forward, aux paragraphes 32 \u00e0 34).\n[61] De plus, le fait que Matson et Andrews sont des d\u00e9cisions analogues \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par le fait que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Murphy a express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9 Druken. \u00c0 mon avis, il est clair que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait l\u2019intention que ses conclusions visent des cas o\u00f9 le gouvernement applique les dispositions imp\u00e9ratives d\u2019un texte de loi, plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la lecture des observations de la Cour au paragraphe 7, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9crit ci-dessus. Il est possible de soutenir que les situations dans Matson et Andrews sont analogues \u00e0 celle dans Murphy. Dans les deux cas, le l\u00e9gislateur a mis au point un r\u00e9gime ou une formule qu\u2019un organisme gouvernemental applique sans aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[62] J\u2019estime que l\u2019analyse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du Tribunal est raisonnable et je conclus que le fait que le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur Murphy \u00e9tait raisonnable. Murphy \u00e9tait un arr\u00eat d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure selon lequel un texte de loi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 5 faite dans Murphy \u00e9tait compatible avec le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi sur les Indiens. En outre, Murphy a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence contradictoire de Druken.\n[38] Avant l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Beattie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate sollicitant la radiation de parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui invoquaient l\u2019application du principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Dans la d\u00e9cision que j\u2019ai rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate (Beattie c. Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada, 2015 TCDP 16), j\u2019ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit la position des parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en grande partie r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e dans leur plaidoirie \u00e0 l\u2019audience), m\u2019appuyant sur les des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate, aux paragraphes 10 et 11 :\n[10] Concernant la requ\u00eate, le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont tous deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations ax\u00e9es sur le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews selon lequel un texte de loi ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 directement en vertu de la LCDP. Selon le plaignant, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi est un service destin\u00e9 au public qui doit \u00eatre fourni sans \u00e9tablir de distinctions et qui rend obligatoire l\u2019inscription des documents constatant des op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres intervenues entre des Indiens inscrits, sans renvoi \u00e0 d\u2019autres conditions ou dispositions de la Loi. Le plaignant soutient que, suivant le sens ordinaire du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 21, le registraire des terres indiennes avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019inscrire les documents soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sans s\u2019interroger quant \u00e0 savoir si les op\u00e9rations d\u00e9crites dans ces documents \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab valides en droit \u00bb en raison d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi qui, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 21. Pour le plaignant, le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews comme moyen de d\u00e9fense est d\u00e9pourvu de pertinence et outrepasse la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, car sa cause se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019application, et non \u00e0 une contestation, d\u2019un texte de loi obligatoire \u2013 \u00e0 savoir l\u2019article 21. En cons\u00e9quence, le plaignant prie le Tribunal de radier de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les paragraphes qui, selon lui, invoquent ce principe.\n[11] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi fait partie d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif qui ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment des autres dispositions de la Loi. Pour bien interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 21, il faut le lire avec les autres dispositions de la Loi, y compris le paragraphe 58(3). Le service offert au public est le processus d\u2019inscription complet qui comprend l\u2019\u00e9tape d\u2019inscription d\u00e9taill\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 21. Ce service ne se limite pas \u00e0 la seule \u00e9tape de l\u2019inscription. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que ce processus est pr\u00e9vu par une loi d\u2019application obligatoire \u00e0 laquelle le registraire des terres indiennes ne peut se soustraire. S\u2019il inscrivait, en vertu de l\u2019article 21, des documents dont la validit\u00e9 est entach\u00e9e par l\u2019application d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi, le registraire enfreindrait la loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que les plaintes visent \u00e0 contester un texte de loi obligatoire et rien d\u2019autre; il invoque \u00e0 l\u2019appui le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews comme moyen de d\u00e9fense principal et l\u00e9gitime. La th\u00e8se selon laquelle interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 21 sans tenir compte des autres dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens est une erreur ne constitue pas une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument du plaignant, le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient de plus que, compte tenu de ce principe, si le plaignant souhaite contester le processus l\u00e9gislatif, en invoquant un motif discriminatoire, il doit le faire devant une cour de justice dans le cadre d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, puisque le texte de loi en question est obligatoire et ne peut \u00eatre chang\u00e9 que par une modification l\u00e9gislative, et non par une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[39] J\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate au motif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de se prononcer sur la question et d\u2019accorder le redressement demand\u00e9 par M. Beattie, au paragraphe 17 comme suit :\n[17] Il appara\u00eet clairement que le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont adopt\u00e9 des positions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es dans leurs observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au sujet d\u2019une question fondamentale dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Le fait que les parties ont toutes les deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments sur le fond de cette question, au lieu de la requ\u00eate en radiation, indique bien la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat oral sur ce point. Le plaignant ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019il serait juste, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, sans la tenue d\u2019une audience, de radier les paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui sont vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate : ils constituent un moyen de d\u00e9fense important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019il vaudrait la peine d\u2019entendre. Radier les paragraphes en question priverait, \u00e0 mon avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n[40] Compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dont une grande partie est mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie III de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et des plaidoiries pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, qui \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate en radiation, je suis maintenant en mesure de me prononcer sur le fond de la pr\u00e9sente question.\nV. Analyse\n[41] Le t\u00e9moignage tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible de Mme Craig, mentionn\u00e9 dans la partie III de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit ni contest\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on importante au cours de l\u2019audience. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, elle a fourni une description d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif comportant des r\u00e8gles interreli\u00e9es et interd\u00e9pendantes qui forment un processus ou un syst\u00e8me qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la gestion des terres en vertu de la Loi, dont l\u2019enregistrement fait partie. Ce syst\u00e8me exige que la Couronne, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire ou de locateur, soit une partie aux baux des terres vis\u00e9es pour que le registraire, sans aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 les enregistrer (consigner) comme baux minist\u00e9riels (non comme baux priv\u00e9s) en vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi.\n[42] En vertu des paragraphes 2(1) et 18(1) de la Loi, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif conf\u00e8re les terres en cause et le titre qui s\u2019y rapporte (qui sont situ\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9serve indienne que le Canada continue d\u2019administrer en vertu de la Loi) \u00e0 la Couronne pour l\u2019usage et le profit de la bande indienne pour laquelle elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 (la Bande indienne d\u2019Okanagan), selon que le d\u00e9termine le gouverneur en conseil.\n[43] L\u2019article 20 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le conseil de bande, avec l\u2019approbation du ministre, peut accorder la possession l\u00e9gale de cette terre de r\u00e9serve \u00e0 un membre de la bande en lui d\u00e9livrant un certificat de possession (CP). Un CP ne conf\u00e8re toutefois pas un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas un acte de transfert (Tyendinaga Mohawk Council v. Brant, 2014 ONCA 565 aux paragraphes 21 et 80 \u00e0 84). Voil\u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que M. Louie avait dans les terres en cause et les CP qui visaient ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des terres en cause \u00e9taient enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 son nom dans le registre.\n[44] Selon l\u2019article 24 de la Loi, seul le transfert du droit de possession des terres dans la r\u00e9serve \u00e0 la bande ou \u00e0 un autre membre de la bande peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par une personne l\u00e9galement en possession des terres, et ce, uniquement avec l\u2019approbation du ministre.\n[45] Selon le paragraphe 28(1) de la Loi, est r\u00e9put\u00e9 nul un bail conclu par un membre d\u2019une bande relativement \u00e0 des terres de r\u00e9serve avec toute autre personne qu\u2019un membre de cette bande, sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe 2. Le paragraphe 28(2) permet au ministre d\u2019autoriser par \u00e9crit toute personne pour une p\u00e9riode maximale d\u2019un an, ou, avec le consentement du conseil de la bande, pour toute p\u00e9riode plus longue, \u00e0 occuper ou utiliser une r\u00e9serve, ou \u00e0 r\u00e9sider ou autrement exercer des droits sur une r\u00e9serve.\n[46] Le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le ministre peut louer au profit de tout Indien, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, la terre dont ce dernier est en possession l\u00e9gitime.\n[47] En vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de tenir un registre o\u00f9 sont inscrits (enregistr\u00e9s) les d\u00e9tails concernant les CP et certificats d\u2019occupation et les autres op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres situ\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9serve.\n[48] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Celgene Corp c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 1 (Celgene), au paragraphe 21, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois consiste \u00e0 examiner le sens ordinaire des mots et le contexte l\u00e9gislatif dans lequel ils s\u2019inscrivent. \u00c0 ce titre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le contexte des articles 20 et 24 \u00e9claire l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation juste du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi selon laquelle les mots \u00ab [l]e ministre peut louer \u00bb exigent que le ministre soit le locateur d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Sinon, il soutient que l\u2019objet de l\u2019article 24 et du paragraphe 28(1) est redondant. Cette exigence pr\u00e9vue par la Loi se refl\u00e8te dans l\u2019article 10.1.12 du Guide, qui pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que le locateur doit \u00eatre la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[49] En outre, citant de nouveau l\u2019arr\u00eat Celgene, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de jurisprudence concernant l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, mais en se fondant sur son libell\u00e9 et le contexte l\u00e9gislatif, les \u00ab autres op\u00e9rations \u00bb incluraient les baux en vertu du paragraphe 58(3).\n[50] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Beattie \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019a pas contredit le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Craig \u00e0 propos de la fa\u00e7on dont le SETI, le Guide et la Loi interagissent et sont interd\u00e9pendants. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Beattie et ses arguments sont en grande partie fond\u00e9s sur ses opinions selon lesquelles : 1) la Loi elle-m\u00eame est \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle anachronique, paternaliste et discriminatoire envers les Indiens \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards; 2) la Couronne n\u2019est pas la v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire des terres en cause, mais M. Louie en \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et sa succession l\u2019est maintenant; 3) en vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, le registraire est oblig\u00e9, en raison des mots \u00ab sont inscrits \u00bb qui s\u2019y trouvent et parce qu\u2019aucun autre article n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9, d\u2019enregistrer tous les baux, y compris les baux priv\u00e9s, sans prendre en compte les autres articles de la Loi qui pr\u00e9voient que la Couronne est la propri\u00e9taire des terres en cause et exigent que le ministre soit partie aux baux; 4) en refusant d\u2019enregistrer les baux priv\u00e9s (qui sont aussi commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s \u00ab baux au noir \u00bb (\u00ab buckshee \u00bb leases)) entre Indiens inscrits en vertu de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a viol\u00e9 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP en privant les plaignants d\u2019un service (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019enregistrement de documents) destin\u00e9 au public.\n[51] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Craig comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 40 et les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur cette question, tels que d\u00e9crits dans les paragraphes 38, 48 et 49 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 mon avis, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de M. Beattie, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, qui est au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent litige, ne peut \u00eatre pris isol\u00e9ment. Il fait plut\u00f4t partie d\u2019un ensemble de dispositions interd\u00e9pendantes et interreli\u00e9es. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation juste de l\u2019article 21 est qu\u2019il fait partie d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et qu\u2019il est \u00e9clair\u00e9 en le lisant avec d\u2019autres articles, y compris le paragraphe 58(3), exigeant que le ministre, du chef de la Couronne, soit le bailleur des baux de titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel puisque la Couronne est la propri\u00e9taire des terres.\n[52] Pour interpr\u00e9ter un texte de loi comme l\u2019article 21, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019analyser l\u2019\u00e9conomie d\u2019une loi. Comme le souligne R. Sullivan, dans Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, (6e \u00e9d. 2014), au paragraphe 13.12 :\n[traduction] Dans son analyse de l\u2019\u00e9conomie d\u2019une loi, le tribunal tente de d\u00e9couvrir de quelle fa\u00e7on les dispositions ou les parties de la loi interagissent pour mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution un plan plausible et coh\u00e9rent. Il examine ensuite comment la disposition \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter peut se comprendre eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce plan. Le juge Greschuk d\u00e9crit le raisonnement du tribunal dans Melnychuk c. Heard :\n[traduction] Le tribunal doit tenir compte non pas uniquement d\u2019un seul article, mais de tous les articles d\u2019une loi, y compris la relation d\u2019un article avec les autres, la relation d\u2019un article avec l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que vise la loi en cause, l\u2019importance de l\u2019article, la port\u00e9e enti\u00e8re de la loi et l\u2019intention v\u00e9ritable de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qui l\u2019a adopt\u00e9e.\nLa Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019extrait tir\u00e9 de Melnychuk dans De Silva c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et immigration), 2014 CF 790 au paragraphe 42.\n[53] Je ne crois pas que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur au regard de la Loi et du SETI \u00e9tait de pr\u00e9voir, d\u2019une part, que la Couronne soit propri\u00e9taire des terres en question et d\u2019exiger que le ministre consente \u00e0 tous les baux de ces terres en vertu des articles de la Loi mentionn\u00e9s dans les paragraphes 42 \u00e0 46 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et du Guide et, d\u2019autre part, permettre au registraire d\u2019enregistrer des baux en vertu de l\u2019article 21 qui ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 ces exigences. Non seulement cela ne constituerait pas un plan plausible et coh\u00e9rent, mais cela serait \u00e9galement contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public en ce qui concerne qui informer les membres du public de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e et ne pas les induire en erreur lorsqu\u2019ils souhaitent utiliser le registre en raison de son efficacit\u00e9.\n[54] Les mots \u00ab sont inscrits \u00bb et \u00ab autres documents \u00bb comme ils sont utilis\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 21 de la Loi doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le contexte de l\u2019ensemble du r\u00e9gime de gestion des terres comme \u00e9tant \u00e9clair\u00e9s par les autres articles de la Loi mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi oblige donc le registraire, sans aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, \u00e0 refuser d\u2019enregistrer les baux priv\u00e9s et la cession en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce qu\u2019ils sont des documents non valides suivant le r\u00e9gime de gestion des terres pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Son refus d\u2019enregistrer les baux priv\u00e9s et la cession en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est par cons\u00e9quent pas une violation de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Bien que l\u2019ensemble du processus d\u2019examen et d\u2019enregistrement \u00e9ventuel de documents valides ou du non\u2011enregistrement de documents invalides puisse \u00eatre un service, les crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs pour ce faire ne le sont pas. Les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes contestent le r\u00e9gime de gestion des terres obligatoire pr\u00e9vu par la Loi et non un service fourni par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[55] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis tenu de suivre les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Murhpy, Matson et Andrews et de conclure que les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont exclusivement une contestation ou une contestation indirecte d\u2019un texte de loi et rien d\u2019autre, qui va au-del\u00e0 de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[56] Comme je l\u2019ai not\u00e9 dans le paragraphe 50, \u00e0 mon avis, M. Beattie conteste essentiellement un texte de loi (la Loi) qu\u2019il estime, \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards, anachronique, paternaliste et discriminatoire envers les Indiens. Son opinion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard peut tr\u00e8s bien correspondre \u00e0 l\u2019opinion selon laquelle les Premi\u00e8res nations devraient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es de nation \u00e0 nation avec le Canada, plut\u00f4t que comme ses pupilles dans un syst\u00e8me de gestion des terres qui font des Premi\u00e8res nations des subordonn\u00e9es plut\u00f4t que des \u00e9gales. Pour que cette relation change, il faudra apporter des modifications aux politiques du gouvernement du Canada et aux lois. Subsidiairement, M. Beattie peut tenter de contester le texte de loi devant un tribunal en vertu de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\nVI.

Contexte\n[1] Le 3 juin 2011, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans de l\u2019\u00e9poque (aujourd\u2019hui P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada) (\u00ab POC \u00bb). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que POC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb ou la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb) en omettant ou en refusant de tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience et en le traitant de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable par l\u2019application de lignes de conduite discriminatoires, le privant ainsi d\u2019une chance d\u2019emploi. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de telle sorte que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est devenu le \u00ab procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, repr\u00e9sentant POC et la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada \u00bb (la \u00ab CFP \u00bb) (collectivement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb).\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente instruction est assujettie \u00e0 une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[3] Chaque partie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. La Commission ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 divulgue d\u2019autres documents (la \u00ab requ\u00eate en divulgation \u00bb), et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2015 TCDP 13, rendue le 29 mai 2015 (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision du 29 mai \u00bb).\n[5] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des documents figurant au tableau 2 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant, mais non les documents figurant au tableau 1 de cet avis (les \u00ab documents du tableau 1 \u00bb), au motif que cette demande de divulgation n\u2019\u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 aucun des faits ni \u00e0 aucune des questions ou des formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[6] Dans sa requ\u00eate en divulgation, le plaignant a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 des documents qui, selon lui, \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi ne s\u2019inscrivait pas dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[7] Les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai sont les suivantes :\nle plaignant a cit\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) et l\u2019article 59 de la Loi dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, mais le Tribunal n\u2019a comp\u00e9tence que sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c);\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tant d\u2019avis que le harc\u00e8lement vis\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) ne s\u2019inscrivait pas dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des parties de savoir si la plainte comprenait le harc\u00e8lement;\nle Tribunal doit trancher la question de la port\u00e9e de la plainte avant de pouvoir se prononcer sur la demande du plaignant concernant la divulgation de documents li\u00e9s au harc\u00e8lement.\n[8] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai a donc invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations sur les points suivants :\nsi la plainte inclut une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) (\u00ab l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement \u00bb);\nsi l\u2019une des parties est d\u2019avis que non, son point de vue sur une modification de la plainte pour y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement.\n[9] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai a de plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet de la communication des documents du tableau 1, au paragraphe 34 :\nSi le plaignant est en mesure de formuler une demande plus pr\u00e9cise d\u00e9montrant clairement en quoi les documents re\u00e7us jusqu\u2019ici sont inad\u00e9quats, et en quoi toute autre demande de divulgation est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, le Tribunal \u00e9valuera et tranchera alors la demande apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des autres parties.\n[10] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses observations (les \u00ab observations du plaignant \u00bb) et sa r\u00e9plique (la \u00ab r\u00e9plique \u00bb) \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur ses observations (la \u00ab r\u00e9ponse \u00bb). La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations.\nII. Questions en litige\nLa plainte inclut-elle une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi?\nSi l\u2019une des parties est d\u2019avis que la plainte n\u2019inclut pas une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, le Tribunal doit-il modifier la plainte pour l\u2019inclure?\nLe plaignant a-t-il droit \u00e0 la divulgation des documents du tableau 1, comme il le demande dans ses observations?\nA. La plainte inclut-elle une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi?\nB. Sinon, le Tribunal doit-il modifier la plainte pour l\u2019inclure?\n[11] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu : [\u2026] c) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n1. Position du plaignant sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement et la modification de la plainte\n[12] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 inclus l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement dans la plainte (qu\u2019il appelle aussi le [traduction] \u00ab formulaire de plainte \u00bb), car :\nla plainte all\u00e8gue [traduction] \u00ab amplement \u00bb l\u2019existence d\u2019un harc\u00e8lement et de [traduction] \u00ab liens avec une d\u00e9ficience \u00bb, de sorte que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) s\u2019applique;\nlorsque la Commission avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il fallait renvoyer la plainte au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal en vue d\u2019une instruction, les documents qu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9s comprenaient la plainte, le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate;\nla lettre de renvoi au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 31 juillet 2012, par laquelle la Commission demandait au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte (la \u00ab lettre de renvoi \u00bb), \u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 la plainte et ne limitait pas les all\u00e9gations que le Tribunal devait examiner;\nconform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7 [Kanagasabapathy], c\u2019est la lettre de renvoi qui d\u00e9termine la port\u00e9e de la plainte (Kanagasabapathy, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 38);\nle fait que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission ne faisait pas mention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) n\u2019est pas pertinent, car ce formulaire ne fait pas partie de la plainte elle\u2011m\u00eame; il constitue simplement une pi\u00e8ce jointe de nature administrative que r\u00e9dige la Commission, pour usage interne;\nle plaignant n\u2019a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte;\nle formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte n\u2019a aucun statut juridique et ne limite pas les all\u00e9gations de la plainte;\nles paragraphes 2 et 69 \u00e0 76 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant traitent express\u00e9ment de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement du plaignant fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 14 de la Loi;\nm\u00eame si les paragraphes 8, 10 et 11 de la plainte ne font pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment mention de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, il n\u2019est pas obligatoire que la plainte cite des dispositions pr\u00e9cises de la Loi;\nl\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) ne constitue pas une nouvelle plainte parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 sait, depuis que le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 les courriels joints en tant que pi\u00e8ce A \u00e0 sa r\u00e9plique (la \u00ab cha\u00eene de courriels du plaignant \u00bb) \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire depuis 2010 \u2013 que le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il l\u2019a harcel\u00e9, et que ce harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab directement li\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience;\naucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est donc caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, parce que, comme il est mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, il \u00e9tait au courant du harc\u00e8lement.\n[13] Le plaignant s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on modifie la plainte en vue d\u2019y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. Selon lui, il est [traduction] \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait clair \u00bb que la plainte, dans sa forme actuelle, comporte cette all\u00e9gation.\n[14] Le plaignant soutient que, si le Tribunal d\u00e9cide n\u00e9anmoins que la plainte doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, il existe des d\u00e9cisions qui \u00e9tayent le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal de le faire \u2013 par exemple Carol Cook c. Premi\u00e8re Nation d\u2019Onion Lake, d\u00e9cision no 1, (TCDP) 22 avril 2002 [Cook c. Onion Lake].\n[15] Une modification visant \u00e0 inclure une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement ne changerait pas la port\u00e9e de la plainte, pas plus que cela n\u2019\u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte, parce que la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce contient d\u00e9j\u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation.\n2. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que le harc\u00e8lement ne s\u2019inscrit pas dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas faire droit \u00e0 la demande de modification pour ajouter \u00e0 la plainte l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c), pour les raisons suivantes :\na. Comp\u00e9tence\nle libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 44(1) et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi signifie que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour instruire une plainte [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9coule directement de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission et du renvoi ult\u00e9rieur de cette plainte \u00bb;\ndans le cas de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la Commission n\u2019a pas men\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le harc\u00e8lement et a refus\u00e9 de le faire, comme le pr\u00e9cisent clairement des courriels annex\u00e9s que la Commission et le plaignant se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s;\nl\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement ne pouvait donc pas faire partie de la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal;\nil s\u2019ensuit que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tent pour instruire la question et qu\u2019il exc\u00e9derait sa comp\u00e9tence s\u2019il modifiait la plainte en vue d\u2019inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement.\nb. Autres facteurs\nLe plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9paration pour harc\u00e8lement \u2013 toutes les r\u00e9parations que le plaignant souhaite obtenir sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 son all\u00e9gation de d\u00e9faut de tenir compte de ses besoins dans le processus de nomination \u2013 le harc\u00e8lement ne pouvait donc pas \u00eatre inclus dans la plainte;\nle fait que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant fasse r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions de la Loi en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement n\u2019est pas pertinent \u2013 la plainte ne l\u2019a jamais fait;\nla conduite qui, selon le plaignant, constituait du harc\u00e8lement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite; il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses [traduction] \u00ab demandes r\u00e9p\u00e9titives et insistantes \u00bb; cette conduite [traduction] \u00ab a trait \u00e0 un diff\u00e9rend en milieu de travail entre le plaignant et M. Gardiner \u00bb;\nrien dans la plainte ne relie les gestes de M. Gardiner \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite, m\u00eame par le plaignant lui-m\u00eame;\nla Commission n\u2019a trait\u00e9 d\u2019aucune all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, ce qui est [traduction] \u00ab une autre indication qu\u2019elle ne faisait manifestement pas partie de la plainte \u00bb.\nc. Formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte\nNi la version originale du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission ni sa version modifi\u00e9e ne font \u00e9tat d\u2019un harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) ou de l\u2019article 59;\nle formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte joint \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour en retirer l\u2019article 10 en tant que motif et, l\u00e0 encore, il ne fait pas mention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c).\nd.

Parent, 2006 CF 1313 [Parent], au paragraphe 40, le facteur le plus important dont un tribunal doit tenir compte dans la d\u00e9cision d\u2019accorder ou non une modification est celui de savoir si cette modification portera pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la partie adverse;\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 subira effectivement un pr\u00e9judice, car le harc\u00e8lement constituerait une plainte essentiellement nouvelle, ce qui est contraire aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions Cook c.

Loi, jurisprudence concernant la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte et modification d\u2019une plainte\n[17] Le paragraphe 43(1) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nLa Commission peut charger une personne, appel\u00e9e, dans la pr\u00e9sente loi, \u00ab l\u2019enqu\u00eateur \u00bb, d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte.\n[18] Le paragraphe 44(1) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nL\u2019enqu\u00eateur pr\u00e9sente son rapport \u00e0 la Commission le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s la fin de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[19] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nSur r\u00e9ception du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission :\na) peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer, en application de l\u2019article 49, un membre pour instruire la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport, si elle est convaincue :\n(i) d\u2019une part, que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9,\n(ii) d\u2019autre part, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de renvoyer la plainte en application du paragraphe (2) ni de la rejeter aux termes des alin\u00e9as 41c) \u00e0 e); \u00bb\n[20] Le paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nLa Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n[21] La d\u00e9cision Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) pr\u00e9sente les indications les plus r\u00e9centes de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 propos des modifications : la plainte initiale et la modification demand\u00e9e doivent \u00eatre toutes deux fond\u00e9es sur un facteur commun (Parent, (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), au paragraphe 43).\n[22] La modification propos\u00e9e ne peut pas constituer une plainte nouvelle et diff\u00e9rente (Canderel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\n[23] De plus, pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder une modification ou non, le Tribunal n\u2019entreprend pas un examen du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la modification propos\u00e9e (Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9 [Tabor], au paragraphe 4).\n[24] M\u00eame s\u2019il existe d\u2019autres facteurs susceptibles de favoriser cette option, le Tribunal ne peut pas accorder une modification si celle-ci est susceptible de porter pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 une autre partie \u00e0 la plainte (Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 40), (Cook c.

Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704 [Mus\u00e9e des civilisations], au paragraphe 28. Le pr\u00e9judice doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et avoir une incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience (Cook c. Onion Lake, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 20).\n4. Analyse concernant le harc\u00e8lement et la modification\na. Comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour ce qui est d\u2019instruire une plainte d\u00e9coule directement du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et du renvoi ult\u00e9rieur de la plainte au Tribunal par la Commission. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019a pas fait enqu\u00eate sur le harc\u00e8lement, son renvoi de cette plainte au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal ne pouvait pas inclure une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. Pour analyser cet argument, je prends en compte les facteurs qui suivent.\n[26] Le paragraphe 43(1) de la Loi conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission le choix de ne pas [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] d\u00e9signer un enqu\u00eateur, par l\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab peut \u00bb, plut\u00f4t que du mot \u00ab doit \u00bb, qui est imp\u00e9ratif. C\u2019est donc dire que la Commission peut renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal pour instruction sans proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une quelconque enqu\u00eate. C\u2019est ce que confirme le paragraphe 49(1), qui autorise la Commission \u00e0 demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte \u00ab \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00bb si elle est \u00ab convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 [la plainte], que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[27] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi ne dit pas que, s\u2019il est recommand\u00e9 dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019une plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour instruction, la Commission est oblig\u00e9e de le faire, et il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re. Cet alin\u00e9a ne dit pas non plus que, s\u2019il est recommand\u00e9 dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate que la Commission rejette une plainte ou recommande de ne pas renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal, la Commission est oblig\u00e9e de le faire, et il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re.\n[28] De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) ne peut pas \u00eatre lu et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 isol\u00e9ment.\n[29] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) prescrit \u00e9galement que la Commission doit \u00eatre \u00ab convaincue [\u2026] que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9 \u00bb. Le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate est l\u2019un des documents que la Commission examine pour arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision, mais uniquement si elle a ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. M\u00eame s\u2019il y a eu une enqu\u00eate, cette disposition de la Loi prescrit que la Commission doit quand m\u00eame tenir compte des \u00ab circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte \u00bb pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est \u00ab justifi\u00e9 \u00bb de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son examen.\n[30] Les conditions que doit remplir la Commission pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal pour instruction sont donc les suivantes : premi\u00e8rement, la plainte doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission et, deuxi\u00e8mement, la Commission doit \u00eatre \u00ab convaincue [\u2026] que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[31] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les paragraphes 43(1) et 49(1) de la Loi ont pour effet conjugu\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la Commission \u00e0 renvoyer une plainte au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une enqu\u00eate ou de produire le rapport qui en d\u00e9coule. La Commission peut renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal \u00ab \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure \u00bb \u00e0 son d\u00e9p\u00f4t par le plaignant aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[32] J\u2019ai lu rapidement les s\u00e9ries de courriels que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a joints \u00e0 sa r\u00e9ponse en tant qu\u2019onglets 118 et 120 (la \u00ab cha\u00eene de courriels de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb). J\u2019ai lu rapidement aussi la s\u00e9rie de courriels que le plaignant a joints en tant que pi\u00e8ce A \u00e0 sa r\u00e9plique (la cha\u00eene de courriels du plaignant).\n[33] \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019instruction, ni la cha\u00eene de courriels de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ni celle du plaignant ne sont produites pour prouver la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leur contenu; il y est fait simplement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour d\u00e9montrer que les courriels en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s aux dates indiqu\u00e9es.\n[34] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de ne pas renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal \u2013 mais plut\u00f4t de la rejeter. La Commission l\u2019a tout de m\u00eame envoy\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour instruction. Il fallait qu\u2019elle soit \u00ab convaincue [\u2026] que, compte tenu des circonstances \u00bb de la plainte, il \u00e9tait \u00ab justifi\u00e9 \u00bb de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son examen.\n[35] Je conclus donc que le fait que l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission n\u2019incluait pas le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi ne d\u00e9termine pas la port\u00e9e de la plainte, en particulier parce que, dans la plainte, la Commission a, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, pass\u00e9 outre \u00e0 la recommandation du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[36] De plus, une instruction du Tribunal est assimilable \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s de novo \u2013 un \u00ab proc\u00e8s depuis le d\u00e9but \u00bb. Le Tribunal jette un regard neuf \u2013 depuis le d\u00e9but \u2013 \u00e0 la plainte ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles. Il n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ou par les conclusions de la Commission, comme l\u2019a conclu, par exemple, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Gravel c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CF 832, au paragraphe 50.\n[37] Pour d\u00e9terminer le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, je tiens \u00e9galement compte d\u2019autres facteurs, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s.\nb. Plainte, formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte et lettre de renvoi\n[38] Je signale les paragraphes suivants qui sont tir\u00e9s de la plainte, en reprenant sa num\u00e9rotation :\n[traduction]\n8. Mon courriel a ensuite d\u00e9clench\u00e9 un long \u00e9change de courriels avec le DGGPE (Mike Gardiner), dans lesquels il m\u2019a harcel\u00e9 \u00e0 propos du fait que j\u2019avais mis en cause des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs relativement \u00e0 la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation. Il a aussi exerc\u00e9 sur moi des pressions excessives et injustifi\u00e9es pour que j\u2019aille le rencontrer en vue de discuter de ma demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation. Je lui ai dit que le fait de continuer d\u2019en discuter aurait un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur ma sant\u00e9 mentale. Le DGGPE a continu\u00e9 de faire pression sur moi, a mis en doute la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ma d\u00e9ficience et a menac\u00e9 (a promis, en fait) de prendre des mesures disciplinaires si je continuais de refuser de le rencontrer. En fin de compte, le caract\u00e8re conflictuel, agressif et intimidant de ces m\u00e9thodes m\u2019a caus\u00e9 un stress psychologique \u00e9norme, qui m\u2019a rapproch\u00e9 de mon point de rupture pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9tabli. Je ne pouvais tout simplement plus endurer cette intimidation incessante, abusive et autoritaire. J\u2019ai donc inform\u00e9 [le commissaire Da Pont] qu\u2019il fallait que le DGGPE cesse d\u2019agir en son nom et de me harceler. [\u2026]\n10. [\u2026] POC a tol\u00e9r\u00e9 et a encourag\u00e9 l\u2019intimidation que le DGGPE exer\u00e7ait \u00e0 mon endroit et a par ailleurs d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et activement fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 mon endroit [\u2026]\n[39] Le Tribunal doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ce que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Robinson, [1994] 3 CF 228 : \u00ab [l]es formules de plainte ne doivent pas \u00eatre scrut\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019un acte d\u2019accusation en mati\u00e8re criminelle \u00bb. La plainte ne cite express\u00e9ment aucune disposition de la Loi relative au harc\u00e8lement, mais je conclus qu\u2019elle fait bel et bien \u00e9tat d\u2019un type de comportement que le plaignant qualifie de harc\u00e8lement et qui, \u00e0 son avis, fait partie des circonstances de sa plainte.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la version initiale du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission et sa version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ne font aucunement mention de harc\u00e8lement, il s\u2019ensuit que le harc\u00e8lement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inclus dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal.\n[41] Le plaignant soutient que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte est simplement un document administratif et que le fait que ces deux versions ne fassent pas \u00e9tat de harc\u00e8lement n\u2019est pas pertinent, et n\u2019a aucun effet juridique.\n[42] J\u2019ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si d\u2019autres affaires du Tribunal traitaient de l\u2019importance ou du poids \u00e0 accorder au formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, et j\u2019en ai trouv\u00e9 deux.\n[43] Dans la d\u00e9cision Deschambeault c. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 TCDP 48 [Deschambeault], le Tribunal a fait remarquer que la plaignante, non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans sa plainte \u00ab quelles dispositions de la Loi \u00bb avaient cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es (au paragraphe 1). Le Tribunal s\u2019\u00e9tait servi du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte que la Commission avait joint \u00e0 la plainte, o\u00f9 l\u2019article 7 \u00e9tait cit\u00e9 comme \u00ab article applicable \u00bb et \u00ab l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique \u00bb \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e comme \u00ab motif de distinction illicite \u00bb, pour juger que la plainte de Mme Deschambeault avait trait \u00e0 un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique (ibidem).\n[44] Dans la d\u00e9cision Corrine McAdam c. Big River First Nation, 2009 TCDP 2 [McAdam], le Tribunal a pris en compte le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte ainsi que l\u2019observation faite par la plaignante, non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience et le [traduction] \u00ab contexte de la plainte \u00bb pour pr\u00e9ciser l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (au paragraphe 2).\n[45] La plainte dont il \u00e9tait question dans la d\u00e9cision McAdam ne pr\u00e9cisait pas non plus les dispositions de la Loi que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait cens\u00e9ment viol\u00e9es (au paragraphe 4). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a fait remarquer que le \u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte \u00bb de la Commission \u00e9tait \u00ab [\u2026] annex\u00e9 au formulaire de plainte [\u2026] \u00bb et \u00ab [\u2026] faisait partie des documents de plainte [\u2026] envoy\u00e9s au Tribunal lorsque la Commission [avait] renvoy\u00e9e la plainte pour instruction \u00bb (ibidem). Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte pr\u00e9cisait que l\u2019article 5 \u00e9tait la \u00ab disposition de la Loi applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb, et le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019article 5 \u00e9tait la disposition applicable (ibidem).\n[46] Les affaires susmentionn\u00e9es montrent que, dans les cas o\u00f9 une plainte ne pr\u00e9cisait pas la disposition de la Loi qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cens\u00e9ment viol\u00e9e, les motifs sur lesquels la violation \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e ou l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal avait pris en compte et accept\u00e9 des renseignements qui figuraient dans le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission pour clarifier ces questions.\n[47] Je conclus que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte est un document de nature administrative r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par des membres du personnel de la Commission et est annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi de la Commission. Dans le cas de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, le plaignant n\u2019avait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du formulaire.\n[48] Les deux affaires susmentionn\u00e9es montrent que le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 un certain poids au formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte en vue de pr\u00e9ciser quelle disposition de la Loi s\u2019applique \u00e0 une plainte et, en tenant compte d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, en vue de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intim\u00e9 exact, mais non en vue de se prononcer sur le cadre d\u2019une plainte.\n[49] Dans la d\u00e9cision Deschambeault, le Tribunal s\u2019est dit convaincu que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte \u00e9tablissait lui\u2011m\u00eame la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question. Dans la d\u00e9cision McAdam, le Tribunal a pris en compte non seulement le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, mais aussi les observations initiales de la plaignante, de m\u00eame que le [traduction] \u00ab contexte de la plainte \u00bb pour arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[50] J\u2019estime que la question qui se pose dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, quant au poids \u00e0 accorder au formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, est diff\u00e9rente de celle des pr\u00e9cisions qui \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires dans les d\u00e9cisions Deschambeault et McAdam. Ici, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de limiter [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] la port\u00e9e de la plainte en accordant un poids important au fait que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte ne mentionne aucune disposition de la Loi relative au harc\u00e8lement, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9nonce le motif du harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab refl\u00e9ter plus fid\u00e8lement les all\u00e9gations du plaignant \u00bb et que la [traduction] \u00ab port\u00e9e de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour celui d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience (d\u00e9faut d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation) [\u2026] \u00bb. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 au sujet de la modification de ce formulaire, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a contribu\u00e9.\n[52] Je juge que la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Kanagasabapathy (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29) s\u2019applique. C\u2019est la lettre de la Commission au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, renvoyant une plainte pour instruction, qui est la \u00ab meilleure preuve \u00bb du cadre d\u2019une plainte. Il \u00ab s\u2019agit donc du document qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 ou non \u00bb (ibidem). Je conclus que, par suite de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Kanagasabapathy, comme dans les affaires Deschambeault et McAdam, le Tribunal peut utiliser le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte comme aide pour clarifier des aspects d\u2019une plainte, mais non pour en limiter la port\u00e9e.\n[53] Dans la plainte dont il est ici question, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a modifi\u00e9 le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte et cette modification a supprim\u00e9 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence faite \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Cependant, l\u2019all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi, qui avait trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si la politique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb est discriminatoire ou tend \u00e0 l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des personnes ayant la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que celle du plaignant, demeure dans une cat\u00e9gorie de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. C\u2019est le fond de la plainte qui est important, et non le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte. L\u2019opinion d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur au sujet de la port\u00e9e de la plainte ne lie pas non plus le Tribunal.\n[54] Je conclus que c\u2019est le fond de la plainte qui est important, et non le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, et que ce formulaire ne restreint pas la port\u00e9e de la plainte si la lettre de renvoi ne le fait pas. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans la d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), la Commission est en droit de limiter ou de nuancer le cadre de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019elle a fait dans la d\u00e9cision Johnston c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 6, \u00e0 laquelle il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30, et dans la d\u00e9cision Northwest Territories v. P.S.A.C., (1999) 162 FTR 50, (ibidem). Cependant, elle ne le fait pas par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, mais par celui de la lettre de renvoi, transmise directement par la Commission au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal.\n[55] Il n\u2019y avait aucune limite de cette nature dans la lettre de renvoi dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Citant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour instruction, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00ab convaincue [\u2026] que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle\u2011ci est justifi\u00e9 \u00bb.\nc. Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant\n[56] Aux paragraphes 73, 74, 75 et 76 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant fait \u00e9tat des agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui, selon ce qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue, constituent un harc\u00e8lement [traduction] \u00ab contraire \u00e0 la LCDP \u00bb. Cette section de son expos\u00e9 est intitul\u00e9e : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il fait preuve d\u2019un m\u00e9pris d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la sant\u00e9 et du bien\u2011\u00eatre du plaignant? \u00bb\n[57] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant fait \u00e9tat de ce qui suit, au paragraphe 73 :\n[traduction]\nContrairement \u00e0 la LCDP [la note de bas de page no 20, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de \u00ab LCDP \u00bb cite l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) et l\u2019article 59 de la Loi], M. Gardiner a ensuite intimid\u00e9, menac\u00e9 et harcel\u00e9 sans raison le plaignant. Il a eu recours de mani\u00e8re persistante \u00e0 ce comportement offensif, malgr\u00e9 de multiples mises en garde du plaignant sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et sur le fait que les intentions ou les agissements de M. Gardiner \u00e9taient d\u00e9plac\u00e9s et blessants.\n[58] Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 au paragraphe 74 que le commissaire de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re et le sous\u2011ministre de l\u2019\u00e9poque [traduction] \u00ab ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant \u00bb du comportement du DGGPE et sont rest\u00e9s silencieux [traduction] \u00ab sinon complices \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces actes r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs d\u2019intimidation et de harc\u00e8lement \u00bb. Apr\u00e8s le mot [traduction] \u00ab intimidation \u00bb, il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans une note de bas de page \u00e0 la politique du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada concernant certains comportements, laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] inclut le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[59] Je conclus que, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, non seulement le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a harcel\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re contraire \u00e0 la Loi, mais il cite aussi les dispositions de la Loi en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019article 59 est cit\u00e9 par erreur, et il en est question dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai, mais l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) est lui aussi cit\u00e9.\nd. Lien entre le harc\u00e8lement et un motif illicite\n[60] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la plainte ne lie les actes pr\u00e9tendument commis par le DGGPE \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite vis\u00e9 par la Loi. Le plaignant est d\u2019avis que le harc\u00e8lement est directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Il ajoute que, dans la plainte, il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience et que cette all\u00e9gation est expos\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail.\n[61] Au paragraphe 8 de la plainte, le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu\u2019au cours du harc\u00e8lement dont il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, le DGGPE a mis en doute la [traduction] \u00ab v\u00e9racit\u00e9 \u00bb de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le plaignant fonde la totalit\u00e9 de ses autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination sur sa d\u00e9ficience. Aucun autre motif n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 dans sa plainte ou dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[62] Je conclus donc que la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant est le motif sur lequel repose l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement.\ne. Diff\u00e9rend en milieu de travail\n[63] L\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9, selon laquelle les interactions que le plaignant qualifie d'actes de harc\u00e8lement \u00e9taient en fait un diff\u00e9rend en milieu de travail, a trait au bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. Pour le Tribunal, il est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci de se prononcer sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de cette all\u00e9gation (d\u00e9cision Tabor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\nf. Pr\u00e9judice\n[64] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019inclusion du harc\u00e8lement dans la plainte porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 une audition \u00e9quitable ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crites plus t\u00f4t, sous la rubrique \u00ab Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb.\ng. L\u2019inclusion du harc\u00e8lement constitue-t-elle une \u00ab nouvelle plainte \u00bb?\n[65] L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il subirait un pr\u00e9judice si la plainte \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9e inclure \u2013 ou si elle \u00e9tait modifi\u00e9e pour inclure \u2013 le harc\u00e8lement vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c), parce que cette all\u00e9gation constitue une plainte substantiellement nouvelle, que m\u00eame d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions ne lui permettraient pas de se d\u00e9fendre convenablement et que cela porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[66] Pour examiner la question de savoir si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement constitue une nouvelle plainte, j\u2019ai tenu compte des aspects suivants :\nil est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 au paragraphe 5 de la plainte que le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au commissaire de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne (le \u00ab commissaire \u00bb) parce que celui-ci \u00e9tait un \u00ab champion \u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi;\nle courriel faisait part au commissaire des difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019avait le plaignant \u00e0 obtenir ce qu\u2019il estimait \u00eatre une r\u00e9ponse appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 sa demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation;\nle plaignant a re\u00e7u un courriel de r\u00e9ponse du DGGPE de l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Gardiner, pour le compte du commissaire (plus tard retir\u00e9);\nil est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 5 de quelle fa\u00e7on le directeur du plaignant est intervenu dans la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation de ce dernier, et il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait toujours pas fourni une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante \u00e0 cette demande;\nle paragraphe 7 de la plainte d\u00e9crit le courriel que le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 par la suite au commissaire, avec copie au sous\u2011ministre et \u00e0 une autre personne, tous deux \u00ab champions \u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi;\ndans ce courriel, il disait notamment au commissaire qu\u2019il y avait un probl\u00e8me au minist\u00e8re au sujet de son incapacit\u00e9 ou son d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat apparents \u00e0 offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation aux personnes atteintes du m\u00eame type de d\u00e9ficience que le plaignant;\nau paragraphe 8, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le DGGPE de l\u2019\u00e9poque a r\u00e9pondu et, de l\u2019avis du plaignant, l\u2019a harcel\u00e9 \u2013 harc\u00e8lement qui, notamment, mettait en doute la [traduction] \u00ab v\u00e9racit\u00e9 \u00bb de sa d\u00e9ficience \u2013 et lui demandait, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive, de le rencontrer pour discuter de sa [traduction] \u00ab demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00bb;\nil est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le DGGPE voulait s\u2019entretenir avec le plaignant de sa demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation et qu\u2019il a continu\u00e9 d\u2019exiger qu\u2019ils se rencontrent pendant un certain temps.\n[67] Ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es, et elles ne le seront que sur le fondement d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles produits \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cependant, pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, je conclus qu\u2019\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la conduite et le pr\u00e9tendu harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9crits dans ces all\u00e9gations sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation du plaignant ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la question des mesures d\u2019adaptation discut\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nJe conclus donc que les contacts all\u00e9gu\u00e9s entre le plaignant et le DGGPE, contacts que le plaignant qualifie d'actes de harc\u00e8lement contraires \u00e0 la Loi, ainsi qu\u2019entre le plaignant et d\u2019autres membres du personnel de POC, d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame s\u00e9rie de circonstances que celles de la plainte et font partie de la structure narrative de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Ils ne constituent donc pas une nouvelle plainte et ne portent pas pr\u00e9judice au droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\nh. Expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission et de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[68] La Commission ne participe pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et n\u2019explique donc pas pourquoi son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ne traite pas du harc\u00e8lement. Le Tribunal ne peut pas formuler de conjectures sur ses motivations. Je conclus donc que le Tribunal ne peut tirer aucune inf\u00e9rence de cette omission, quant \u00e0 savoir si le harc\u00e8lement est inclus ou non dans la plainte.\n[69] Pour \u00e9valuer le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir l\u2019intim\u00e9, je tiens compte du fait que son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ne traite pas non plus des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement expos\u00e9es dans la plainte et dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant. Il est raisonnable de conclure que l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 du harc\u00e8lement est qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi ne faisait pas partie de la plainte.\n[70] Le fait qu\u2019une date d\u2019audience n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e est, selon moi, un facteur important qui att\u00e9nue tout pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el qu\u2019une pr\u00e9cision ou une modification en vue d\u2019inclure le harc\u00e8lement pourrait causer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Tribunal peut donc allouer suffisamment de temps \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il r\u00e9vise son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et traite de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, et qu\u2019il trouve et divulgue des documents potentiellement pertinents qui se rapportent \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation. Je signale \u00e9galement que la liste d\u2019\u00e9ventuels t\u00e9moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a incluse dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (au paragraphe 76) inclut l\u2019ancien DGGPE, M. Gardiner, qui est nomm\u00e9 dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement du plaignant.\ni. Le t\u00e9moin n\u2019est plus au service de POC\n[71] L\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle POC n\u2019emploie plus l\u2019ancien DGGPE, M. Gardiner, est un autre facteur dont je tiens compte dans mon \u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice. Ce facteur est pond\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019observation du plaignant selon laquelle l\u2019ancien DGGPE travaille actuellement \u00e0 Service Canada \u00e0 titre de SMA pour l\u2019ouest du Canada et les Territoires.\n[72] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut communiquer avec lui, obtenir de lui des renseignements et l\u2019appeler comme t\u00e9moin. Le fait que l\u2019ancien DGGPE, M. Gardiner, n\u2019est plus aussi disponible pour t\u00e9moigner qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9tait peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte est un inconv\u00e9nient; toutefois, ce fait n\u2019atteint pas le niveau d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el ayant une incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience.\n[73] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 est un autre facteur qui lui porte pr\u00e9judice. Cependant, il en va de m\u00eame pour le plaignant.\n[74] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si l\u2019on inclut dans la plainte l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il a harcel\u00e9 le plaignant sur le fondement de sa d\u00e9ficience, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi.\n[75] Par souci de clart\u00e9, et m\u00eame si j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant incluent l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, il est ordonn\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que l\u2019on modifie officiellement la plainte en vue d\u2019y inclure le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience, un acte contraire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi.\n[76] Le fait que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate modifie officiellement la plainte en vue d\u2019y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) ne confirme pas cette all\u00e9gation. Le Tribunal ne peut d\u00e9cider si cette all\u00e9gation est confirm\u00e9e qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nC. Le plaignant a-t-il droit \u00e0 la divulgation des documents du tableau 1?\n1. Position du plaignant\n[77] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 et continue de demander la divulgation non seulement des documents qui sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des mesures d\u2019adaptation, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de [traduction] \u00ab toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination incluses \u00bb dans la plainte et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[78] Le plaignant ajoute que les documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour sont insuffisants, car ils sont principalement ax\u00e9s sur la question des mesures d\u2019adaptation et n\u2019incluent pas ceux qui sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte. Ces all\u00e9gations comprennent le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi, ainsi que les lignes de conduite discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb, qui l\u2019ont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 et l\u2019ont priv\u00e9 d\u2019une chance d\u2019emploi sur la base du motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est sa d\u00e9ficience, et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait d\u00e9faut de tenir compte de ses besoins, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. De plus, la plainte comporte \u00e9galement des all\u00e9gations contre les lignes directrices concernant la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui sont discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019autres personnes atteintes de la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que celle du plaignant et qui les privent de chances d\u2019emploi, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[79] Dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que POC divulgue la totalit\u00e9 des documents [traduction] \u00ab relatifs \u00e0 toute enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement men\u00e9e par des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de POC concernant Michael Gardiner et\/ou [le plaignant], ou \u00e0 toute discussion s\u2019y rapportant \u00bb. Il a soutenu que la plainte et son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions font tous deux \u00e9tat d\u2019all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et des demandes soumises \u00e0 des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs pour que le harc\u00e8lement cesse.\n[80] Il soutient que sa demande de divulgation des documents du tableau 1 est [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e9cessaire pour savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre politique en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement et, dans l\u2019affirmative, dans quelle mesure \u00bb, et que sa demande inclut des documents susceptibles de [traduction] \u00ab faire la lumi\u00e8re sur la raison pour laquelle le harc\u00e8lement a finalement cess\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[81] Dans ses observations, le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019exigence, faite au paragraphe 28 de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai, de montrer [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] en quoi toute autre demande de divulgation est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles \u00bb. Le plaignant soutient que la description qui est faite dans cette colonne montre le lien qui existe entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les [traduction] \u00ab faits, questions ou formes de redressement potentiellement pertinents \u00e9tablis conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles \u00bb dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n2. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[82] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la divulgation d\u2019autres documents est expos\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous :\nl\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 des centaines de documents qui \u00e9taient en la possession des personnes nomm\u00e9es au tableau 1 ou qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s par elles;\nla demande de divulgation du plaignant est encore exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment large et g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ind\u00e9pendamment de la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb, car le plaignant [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019indique pas les documents pr\u00e9cis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait omis de divulguer \u00bb;\npar cons\u00e9quent, la demande de divulgation \u00e9quivaut encore \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb (Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2004 TCDP 34 (Can LII) [Guay], au paragraphe 43.\n3. Analyse \u2013 parties pertinentes de la plainte\n[83] Les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte qui sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande du plaignant de divulguer les documents mentionn\u00e9s dans le tableau 1 r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sont expos\u00e9es ci-dessous. Un grand nombre de ces all\u00e9gations sont les m\u00eames que celles qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es sous la m\u00eame rubrique dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 29 mai. Plut\u00f4t que de demander au lecteur de se reporter aussi \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, je les inclus toutes ici par souci de commodit\u00e9.\n[traduction]\nle plaignant a un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 son avis, constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi;\nen juin 2008, il a soumis, dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection 08-DFO-IA-NCR-929466 (le \u00ab concours de dotation ENG-05 \u00bb), sa candidature \u00e0 un poste ENG-05 non encore cr\u00e9\u00e9 au sein de POC (le \u00ab poste ENG\u201105 \u00bb), sans pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et sans solliciter de mesures d\u2019adaptation;\nen avril 2009, au terme du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui comprenait une entrevue, POC l\u2019a inclus dans le groupe de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour occuper le poste. Ce groupe devait \u00eatre en place du 20 avril 2009 au 20 octobre 2010;\nle plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que son entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab passable \u00bb et que sa candidature ne serait pas retenue une fois que le poste serait cr\u00e9\u00e9;\nle plaignant a estim\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9ficience lui avait fait obstacle durant l\u2019entrevue et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019identifier comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et n\u00e9cessitant des mesures d\u2019adaptation, ce qu\u2019il a fait en ao\u00fbt 2009. En septembre 2009, il a soumis \u00e0 POC un formulaire de \u00ab demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00bb;\nPOC a propos\u00e9 de refaire la phase d\u2019\u00e9valuation du concours de dotation ENG-05 apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de la CFP des informations concernant les modes d\u2019adaptation sp\u00e9cifiquement indiqu\u00e9s. POC a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de se pr\u00e9senter au Centre de psychologie du personnel (CPP) de la CFP afin de d\u00e9terminer les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9es;\nle plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord et ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au CPP. Il a fait valoir aupr\u00e8s de POC que la mesure d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9e \u00e9tait de le nommer au poste ENG\u201105, et ce, pour les motifs suivants :\nil avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le groupe des candidats qualifi\u00e9s sur la base de crit\u00e8res objectifs, et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certain de se qualifier de nouveau;\nla norme ou la pratique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb \u00e9tablie par la CFP, et dont POC se sert encore dans ses concours de dotation pour \u00e9valuer les candidats, est intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoire vis-\u00e0-vis du plaignant et de ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui;\nl\u2019obligation d\u2019adaptation de l\u2019employeur s\u2019applique tout au long du processus de s\u00e9lection, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la nomination (en incluant cette \u00e9tape);\nau cours des mois qui ont suivi, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveau [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00bb la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation, a discut\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019adaptation ainsi que du formulaire de demande avec sa superviseure, Heather Skaarup (n\u00e9e MacDonald) et des sp\u00e9cialistes en ressources humaines, principalement Ashley Austin;\nen novembre 2009, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au commissaire de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, George Da Pont, pour dire qu\u2019il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme une r\u00e9ponse raisonnable;\nle directeur du plaignant, Nico Pau, lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019accorder les mesures d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il demandait et, aussi, qu\u2019il utilisait le mauvais formulaire de demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation, mais sans lui pr\u00e9ciser quel formulaire \u00e9tait le bon;\nen d\u00e9cembre 2009, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au commissaire Da Pont, avec copie \u00e0 Claire Dansereau et \u00e0 Mme Scattolon; il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la mani\u00e8re dont POC appliquait sa politique d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00e9tait une [traduction] \u00ab farce \u00bb pour ce qui \u00e9tait des personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience non physique;\nle directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Grands projets de l\u2019\u00c9tat, M.

Analyse \u2013 dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal\n[85] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[86] L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) oblige les parties \u00e0 une plainte \u00e0 produire un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui inclut, notamment, la divulgation de documents.\n[87] Pour les besoins de la demande du plaignant, les alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles sont, l\u00e0 encore, particuli\u00e8rement pertinents.\n[88] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles est libell\u00e9 en ces termes :\nChaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n[\u2026]\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle.\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) limite donc l\u2019obligation de divulgation aux \u00ab documents [\u2026] qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle \u00bb.\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) exige une autre liste de documents en la possession de la partie, celle-ci indiquant les documents \u00ab pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u00bb. Le reste de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) r\u00e9it\u00e8re le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d).\n5. Norme de divulgation selon l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles\n[89] La norme relative \u00e0 la divulgation de documents pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 une audience est la \u00ab pertinence potentielle \u00bb. Pour qu\u2019un document soit potentiellement pertinent, il doit y avoir un lien rationnel entre le document demand\u00e9 et un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e ou identifi\u00e9e par les parties (Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (Can LII) [Seeley], au paragraphe 6). Un document potentiellement pertinent peut \u00eatre admissible ou non \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019est pas la norme qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 une divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[90] Chaque partie est tenue de divulguer la totalit\u00e9 des documents potentiellement pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019acquitte pas de cette obligation s\u2019il ne divulgue que les documents qui, \u00e0 son avis, sont suffisants pour que la partie adverse \u00e9tablisse une preuve prima facie.\n[91] Sous r\u00e9serve des observations formul\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s au sujet des \u00ab conseils \u00bb, je conclus que, dans la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb du tableau 1, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli un lien entre les documents dont il demande la divulgation et les questions, les faits ou les formes de redressement qui figurent dans la plainte et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[92] Par exemple, pour ce qui est des documents potentiellement pertinents envoy\u00e9s ou transmis en copie \u00e0 l\u2019ancien DGGPE, M. Gardiner, ou re\u00e7us de lui, le plaignant associe ces documents au d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation ainsi qu\u2019aux questions de harc\u00e8lement figurant dans la plainte. Nul ne conteste que le plaignant et le DGGPE se sont \u00e9crit. Le plaignant a qualifi\u00e9 ces \u00e9changes de courriels et ses discussions avec le DGGPE d'actes de harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi. Le harc\u00e8lement est une question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte ainsi que dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant; par cons\u00e9quent, les documents demand\u00e9s sont potentiellement pertinents, et devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Je signale que dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation le plaignant a demand\u00e9 les documents potentiellement pertinents qui se rapportent \u00e0 toute enqu\u00eate li\u00e9e \u00e0 son all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. Compte tenu de la modification de la plainte, il est \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de divulguer ces documents.\n[93] La description qui est faite dans la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb, au sujet du commissaire Da Pont, constitue un autre exemple. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue dans la plainte qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019ordonner au DGGPE de cesser de communiquer avec lui au sujet des mesures d\u2019adaptation, parce qu\u2019il avait le sentiment d\u2019\u00eatre harcel\u00e9. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait \u00e9tat du manque syst\u00e9mique de mesures d\u2019adaptation de POC, en tant que minist\u00e8re, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes atteintes de la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui. La demande de divulgation est donc li\u00e9e aussi aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte et dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, et elle est potentiellement pertinente.\n[94] Pour ce qui est des autres personnes nomm\u00e9es au tableau 1, la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb associe les documents demand\u00e9s pour chaque personne au d\u00e9faut d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation et aux questions de harc\u00e8lement, qui figurent dans la plainte et dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, ou aux [traduction] \u00ab processus de concours et d\u2019adaptation \u00bb qui font \u00e9galement partie de la plainte et de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des parties, ou encore \u00e0 la question de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb, qui fait elle aussi partie de la plainte et des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties. Ces documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents.\n[95] De plus, Mme Skaarup (n\u00e9e MacDonald) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme la personne nomm\u00e9e au poste concern\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux objectifs d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi du minist\u00e8re pour ce poste. C\u2019est donc dire que les demandes de documents concernant le processus qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 sa s\u00e9lection, \u00e0 sa participation et \u00e0 son int\u00e9gration, ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb, sont rattach\u00e9es aux questions et aux faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la plainte et dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties; ils sont donc potentiellement pertinents.\n[96] Je signale que, dans la colonne \u00ab Liens \u00bb, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on divulgue les documents relatifs \u00e0 des [traduction] \u00ab conseils \u00bb. Il ne pr\u00e9cise pas ce qu\u2019il entend par ce terme. Je signale que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles s\u2019applique aux documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 selon le droit de la preuve.\nD. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 est en vigueur\n[97] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte demeure en vigueur.\nE. Conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique\n[98] D\u00e8s que possible, le Tribunal tiendra une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec toutes les parties en vue de fixer les d\u00e9lais dans lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission d\u00e9poseront chacun un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 portant sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, s\u2019ils souhaitent le faire, ainsi que les d\u00e9lais applicables \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e du plaignant \u00e0 cet expos\u00e9, s\u2019il souhaite en d\u00e9poser une. Lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, des d\u00e9lais seront \u00e9galement fix\u00e9s pour la divulgation des documents qui sera ordonn\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nIII.

Conclusion 20\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, M. Keith Waddle (le plaignant), en vue de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour y ajouter des all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (la requ\u00eate). Chacun des intim\u00e9s, le Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique (le CFCP) et la Conf\u00e9rence ferroviaire Teamsters Canada (CFTC), s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) n\u2019a pas pris position.\nI. L\u2019histoire de la plainte\n[2] Le 28 mars 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP contre le CFCP et la CFTC. Les plaintes initiales ne contenaient pas, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, d\u2019all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Les all\u00e9gations contenues dans les plaintes se rapportaient plut\u00f4t strictement \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Les deux plaintes, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies lors de leur renvoi au Tribunal parce qu\u2019elles soulevaient essentiellement les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit, sont ci\u2011apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9es \u00ab les plaintes \u00bb.\n[3] Environ 17 mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes, par lettre en date du 28 ao\u00fbt 2013, un enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP a communiqu\u00e9 avec le CFCP et la CFTC et indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Je joins \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente lettre un formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 qui ajoute le motif de la situation de famille \u00e0 la plainte. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans modifier le formulaire de plainte, car les deux parties ont r\u00e9pondu aux all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant.\n[4] Par une lettre portant la m\u00eame date, \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9taient joints les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s, un enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP a \u00e9galement communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant en indiquant ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Je joins \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente lettre les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s qui ajoutent le motif de la situation de famille aux plaintes. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans modifier le formulaire de plainte\n[5] \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s pour ajouter la situation de famille comme motif de distinction au titre de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP. La lettre du 28 ao\u00fbt 2013 adress\u00e9e au CFCP et \u00e0 la CFTC indiquait que la CCDP ne modifierait pas les plaintes, car les deux intim\u00e9s avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. La CFTC s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de la situation de famille comme motif de distinction. Je ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tablissant que la CCDP a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette opposition.\n[6] Selon le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate que la CCDP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire le 1er mai 2014, le plaignant n\u2019a fourni aucun motif raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, de sorte que l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation.\n[7] Le 30 juillet 2014, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la CCDP a renvoy\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente affaire au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) au moyen d\u2019une lettre de renvoi indiquant que des [traduction] \u00ab copies des formulaires de plainte sont jointes aux pr\u00e9sentes \u00bb. \u00c9taient jointes \u00e0 cette lettre des copies des deux formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s, des copies des deux formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte initiaux et des copies des plaintes. Dans chacun des deux formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s, la situation de famille avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e comme motif de distinction. Les plaintes, telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal, et sans tenir compte des formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s, ne contenaient, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, aucune mention d\u2019all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, et ne faisaient \u00e9tat que d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[8] \u00c0 la suite du renvoi de la pr\u00e9sente affaire au Tribunal, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et, le 7 octobre 2014, son avocat s\u2019est vu communiquer les documents de la CCDP, y compris les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s. En d\u00e9pit du contenu des formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s, lorsque l\u2019avocat du plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le 30 octobre 2014, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019avant le renvoi de l\u2019affaire au Tribunal, il avait compris, compte tenu des observations que lui avait faites la CCDP, que le motif de la situation de famille avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de prescription. Il aurait donc dit \u00e0 son avocat de ne pas l\u2019inclure dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, le CFCP et la CFTC ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, et l\u2019affaire a suivi son cours de l\u2019\u00e9tape de la communication au premier jour de l\u2019audience sans que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre du plaignant, du CFCP ou de la CFTC ne fasse allusion devant le Tribunal \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille.\n[10] L\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire a commenc\u00e9 le 16 novembre 2015. Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019agent du greffe a lu les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s figurant dans le dossier, lesquels mentionnaient \u00e0 la fois la d\u00e9ficience et la situation de famille comme motifs de distinction all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, il est devenu clair que chacun des avocats du plaignant, du CFCP et de la CFTC avait compris que l\u2019affaire serait instruite en fonction de la d\u00e9ficience comme unique motif de distinction all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Le CFCP et la CFTC se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. La CCDP ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience et aucune observation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en son nom.\n[11] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a confirm\u00e9, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019audience, qu\u2019il ne savait pas que la situation de famille avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e dans le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en ne tenant compte que de la d\u00e9ficience. Apr\u00e8s une pause pendant laquelle il avait pu s\u2019entretenir avec son client, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience afin de pr\u00e9senter une demande en vue de modifier l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour tenir compte des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille. J\u2019ai bri\u00e8vement retard\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement pour permettre l\u2019audition de certains t\u00e9moignages dont l\u2019audition \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vue.\n[12] Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle se soit bri\u00e8vement poursuivie, l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, et avec le consentement des intim\u00e9s, en raison d\u2019une autre affaire. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019ajournement, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat pendant une courte p\u00e9riode. Par la suite, il a fait savoir qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat et qu\u2019il allait de l\u2019avant avec une requ\u00eate en modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour r\u00e9soudre toutes les questions rest\u00e9es en suspens, dont celle des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille.\n[13] Dans la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 26 d\u00e9cembre 2015, le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il demandait la modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour y ajouter la situation de famille. Il a relat\u00e9 le processus du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ses plaintes \u00e0 la CCDP et de la prise en consid\u00e9ration du motif de la situation de famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la CCDP, mais n\u2019a pas \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la modification qu\u2019il demandait ni les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019all\u00e9gation fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de fournir plus de d\u00e9tails sur son all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, ce qu\u2019il a fait, le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2016, au moyen d\u2019un addenda \u00e0 la requ\u00eate (l\u2019addenda).\nII. Les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille\n[14] Les plaintes initiales d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce faisaient \u00e9tat d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience d\u00e9coulant du fait que le CFCP ou la CFTC, ou les deux, avaient omis de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation ad\u00e9quates relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du plaignant pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de juillet 2011 au 7 f\u00e9vrier 2012. Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions initial, le plaignant affirme qu\u2019au 7 f\u00e9vrier 2012, des mesures d\u2019adaptation suffisantes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 son endroit.\n[15] Les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille contenues dans l\u2019addenda portent essentiellement que, dans le cadre du processus visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des mesures d\u2019adaptation relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du plaignant, le CFCP ou la CFTC, ou les deux, n\u2019ont pas correctement indiqu\u00e9 aux autres acteurs de leur organisation que le plaignant avait des obligations familiales \u00e0 Lethbridge (Alberta), o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sidait et travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille se serait produite entre juillet 2011 et le 30 avril 2012.\nIII. La position du plaignant\n[16] Le plaignant soutient que les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille font \u00e0 juste titre partie de sa plainte et qu\u2019il ne serait caus\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties si sa requ\u00eate en vue de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9tait accueillie.\n[17] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019autoriser des modifications aux fins de d\u00e9terminer \u00ab [\u2026] les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb, pourvu que le fait d\u2019autoriser les modifications \u00ab [\u2026] serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb (Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF) (Canderel), cit\u00e9 dans Canada (P.G.) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, au paragraphe 30 (Parent); Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9 (Tabor), au paragraphe 4. Je reconnais que ces d\u00e9cisions traitaient de modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte elle\u2011m\u00eame, mais en me fondant sur le m\u00eame raisonnement, et aux m\u00eames fins, j\u2019estime que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui pr\u00e9cise les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes rel\u00e8ve de la m\u00eame proc\u00e9dure souple de modification.\nIV. Les positions des intim\u00e9s\n[18] Les intim\u00e9s ont chacun pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments initiaux \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la demande de modification du plaignant. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de fournir plus de d\u00e9tails sur ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille et que celui\u2011ci l\u2019eut fait dans l\u2019addenda, les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres arguments \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la requ\u00eate du plaignant. La CCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de la requ\u00eate, mais s\u2019est abstenue de pr\u00e9senter des observations.\n[19] La CFTC s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour les motifs suivants :\n1. l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille constitue une nouvelle plainte qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal;\n2. la modification demand\u00e9e ne donne pas suffisamment de pr\u00e9cisions sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le plaignant invoque \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille;\n3. la requ\u00eate du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille.\n[20] Le CFCP s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour les motifs suivants :\n1. le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser la modification en raison des lacunes que comportent les plaintes, et des conclusions et intentions de l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse de la CCDP;\n2. la modification demand\u00e9e ne donne pas suffisamment de pr\u00e9cisions sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le plaignant invoque \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille;\n3. la requ\u00eate du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille;\n4. la requ\u00eate du plaignant, si elle \u00e9tait accueillie, constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure;\n5. la requ\u00eate du plaignant, si elle \u00e9tait accueillie, serait ind\u00fbment pr\u00e9judiciable et entra\u00eenerait des inefficacit\u00e9s proc\u00e9durales.\n[21] Les arguments du CFCP et de la CFTC seront examin\u00e9s conjointement.\nV. La comp\u00e9tence\n[22] Les arguments de la CFTC et du CFCP quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence sont distincts. La CFTC fait valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour modifier une plainte apr\u00e8s un renvoi de la part de la CCDP de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 introduire une plainte fondamentalement nouvelle. Le CFCP fait valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser la pr\u00e9sente modification pour les deux motifs suivants :\n1. les plaintes ne contenaient aucune mention des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille, lesquelles n\u2019\u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9es que dans le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une plainte en bonne et due forme fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tent;\n2. le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser la modification demand\u00e9e parce que la CCDP n\u2019a pas fait enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille et n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de l\u2019inclure dans le renvoi.\nA. La comp\u00e9tence et le caract\u00e8re suffisant de la plainte\n[23] Le CFCP soutient que le fait que les plaintes ne d\u00e9crivent pas ad\u00e9quatement l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille emp\u00eache le Tribunal de se d\u00e9clarer comp\u00e9tent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet aspect des plaintes. Le CFCP a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Bell Canada, 1981 CanLII 5 (TCDP) (Bell), dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre une affaire renvoy\u00e9e par la CCDP, car le caract\u00e8re de la plainte initiale \u00e9tait si insuffisant que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Dans la d\u00e9cision Bell, le Tribunal a conclu que :\n[\u2026] \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019absence de plainte d\u00fbment d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, ce tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et n\u2019est donc pas comp\u00e9tent pour juger de l\u2019affaire dont il est saisi.\n[24] La d\u00e9cision Bell \u00e9l\u00e8ve au rang de probl\u00e8me de comp\u00e9tence les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au caract\u00e8re insuffisant des pr\u00e9cisions fournies dans une plainte. Ce raisonnement pose probl\u00e8me par rapport aux normes actuelles pour deux raisons principales. La premi\u00e8re se rapporte au libell\u00e9 de l\u2019ancien paragraphe 39(1) de la LCDP, qui parle de constitution du Tribunal. Cette disposition, sur laquelle le tribunal s\u2019est fortement appuy\u00e9 pour d\u00e9finir sa comp\u00e9tence dans la d\u00e9cision Bell, n\u2019existe plus dans la LCDP actuelle. Deuxi\u00e8mement, un bon nombre de d\u00e9cisions des cours sup\u00e9rieures (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, 1992 CanLII 81 (CSC); Canada (P.G.) c. Robinson, 1994 CanLII 3490 (CAF); Bell Canada c. S.C.C.\u00c9.P., 1998 CanLII 8700 (CAF); CCDP c. A.C.E.T., 2002 CFPI 776, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. A.F.P.C. (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704, aux paragraphes 37 \u00e0 54 (Museum); Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 44), lorsqu\u2019elles sont lues ensemble, indiquent clairement que, pour diverses raisons, les plaintes n\u2019arrivent pas toujours au Tribunal en parfait \u00e9tat, mais que cela ne signifie pas que la plainte est entach\u00e9e d\u2019un vice fatal; lorsque la question est soulev\u00e9e, il incombe au Tribunal de s\u2019efforcer de rendre la plainte conforme aux proc\u00e9dures.\n[25] Le Tribunal s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 sur cette dynamique dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. F.A.C., 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 11 \u00e0 12 (cit\u00e9e avec approbation par la Cour dans la d\u00e9cision Museum, au paragraphe 52) :\n[\u2026] Il est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient souvent r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il s\u2019ensuit que les plaintes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fond de la plainte initiale est respect\u00e9, je ne vois pas pourquoi la plaignante et la Commission ne devraient pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 clarifier et \u00e0 expliquer les all\u00e9gations initiales avant la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affaire.\n[26] La port\u00e9e de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal dans une affaire donn\u00e9e ne se d\u00e9finit pas par le caract\u00e8re suffisant des plaintes initiales d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le plaignant, mais par la demande d\u2019instruction de la CCDP. Les lacunes que comportent les pr\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 une plainte peuvent \u00eatre corrig\u00e9es devant la CCDP au moyen de modifications, ou devant le Tribunal, au moyen de modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte ou par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et la modification de ces expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[27] La v\u00e9ritable question de comp\u00e9tence qui se pose dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est de savoir ce qui constituait \u00ab les plaintes \u00bb qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal : les plaintes prises en soi, ou les plaintes prises conjointement avec les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s? La port\u00e9e de ce renvoi est particuli\u00e8rement importante parce qu\u2019il est clair qu\u2019a premi\u00e8re vue, les plaintes ne disent rien au sujet de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille.\n[28] La jurisprudence du Tribunal n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive si le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte fait partie de la plainte aux fins de la comp\u00e9tence. Dans des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte pour d\u00e9terminer la nature de la plainte lorsque le formulaire de plainte \u00e9tait incomplet (voir Deschambeault c. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 TCDP 48 (Deschambeault)). Toutefois, dans l\u2019affaire Deschambeault, le formulaire de plainte contenait toutes les all\u00e9gations factuelles et le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 que pour d\u00e9finir la pratique discriminatoire et le motif illicite qui se d\u00e9gageaient de ces all\u00e9gations. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce sont les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s eux\u2011m\u00eames qui contiennent la seule mention de l\u2019aspect relatif \u00e0 la situation de famille de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination. Les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s ne font pas que pr\u00e9ciser les all\u00e9gations contenues dans les plaintes. Pour pouvoir conclure qu\u2019il est comp\u00e9tent, le Tribunal devrait plut\u00f4t conclure que les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte constituent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des plaintes.\n[29] Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de recevoir une forme quelconque d\u2019observations de la part de la CCDP quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, et au lien qui l\u2019unit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la plainte. Malheureusement, aucune observation de cette nature n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[30] Selon la preuve dont dispose le Tribunal dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il est clair que la CCDP a directement inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de modifier les plaintes initiales, et que seuls les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte seraient modifi\u00e9s pour ajouter le motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille aux plaintes. Par sa propre proc\u00e9dure, la CCDP a elle\u2011m\u00eame accord\u00e9 du poids au formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte et \u00e0 ses modifications. De plus, dans sa lettre renvoyant l\u2019affaire au Tribunal, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la CCDP a inclus tous les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s et les plaintes. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la lettre de renvoi elle\u2011m\u00eame ne dit essentiellement rien sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte faisant l\u2019objet du renvoi, on doit conclure de l\u2019examen de l\u2019ensemble des documents joints \u00e0 l\u2019appui du renvoi que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte peut servir d\u2019instrument de modification de la plainte.\n[31] Compte tenu de l\u2019usage particulier que la CCDP a fait du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il fait effectivement partie des plaintes et peut aider \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\nB. La comp\u00e9tence et le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse de la CCDP\n[32] Le CFCP soutient \u00e9galement que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente affaire parce que l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse de la CCDP n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention qu\u2019elle fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate ou d\u2019un renvoi. Il ressort clairement du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse qu\u2019elle estimait que le plaignant n\u2019avait fourni aucun motif raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, de sorte qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas [traduction] \u00ab donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille \u00bb. Toutefois, cet argument du CFCP soul\u00e8ve plusieurs probl\u00e8mes.\n[33] D\u2019abord, il n\u2019est pas rare que la CCDP renvoie des affaires au TCDP d\u2019une mani\u00e8re contraire aux conclusions de ses enqu\u00eateurs. Les rapports des enqu\u00eateurs ne font pas partie des renvois au TCDP, et ne d\u00e9finissent pas la port\u00e9e de ces renvois. La d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Gover c. L\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 TCDP 14, o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s contestaient le renvoi d\u2019une partie de la plainte en se fondant sur les conclusions du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP, est utile sur ce point :\n[38] En effet, il ressort que, sur le plan juridique, seule la lettre adress\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal tous les pouvoirs que la Loi pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[34] Ensuite, bien que le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse indiqu\u00e2t qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, la CCDP n\u2019a pas ordonn\u00e9 que d\u2019autres changements soient apport\u00e9s aux plaintes. Plus t\u00f4t dans la proc\u00e9dure, la CCDP avait utilis\u00e9 les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s pour ajouter la situation de famille aux plaintes. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 son enqu\u00eateuse, la CCDP aurait pu rejeter la partie des plaintes qui se rapportait \u00e0 la situation de famille en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)b) de la LCDP. Voir, par exemple, Lindor c. TPSGC, 2014 TCDP 13, au paragraphe 2; Emmett c. ARC, 2013 TCDP 12, au paragraphe 40 (Emmett) et Johnston c. F.A.C., 2007 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 6. Elle a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[35] Enfin, le fait de d\u00e9finir la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en fonction du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, ou en fonction du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la CCDP de renvoyer l\u2019affaire, va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la jurisprudence du Tribunal. Il est clair que les affaires peuvent \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9es au TCDP pour instruction en d\u00e9pit des conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP, et que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, comp\u00e9tence qui appartient \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[36] Dans la d\u00e9cision Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2004 TCDP 8, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence dans une situation de renvoi semblable :\n[29] Dans un autre ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le fait que trois enqu\u00eateurs diff\u00e9rents aient fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte au nom de la Commission au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi son d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le fait que le dernier enqu\u00eateur ait recommand\u00e9 de ne pas faire un renvoi au Tribunal et le fait que la Commission ait renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal en d\u00e9pit de cette recommandation sont autant d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui auraient d\u00fb faire partie d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[30] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte de M. Tweten au Tribunal. Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser cette d\u00e9cision.\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, si le CFCP ou la CFTC n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019accord avec la port\u00e9e du renvoi dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, que ce soit en raison des conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur ou pour toute autre raison, leur recours consistait \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nC. Les conclusions concernant la comp\u00e9tence\n[38] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est d\u00e9finie par la port\u00e9e du renvoi fait par la CCDP, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la demande d\u2019instruction. Ce renvoi visait l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des plaintes, qui, selon les faits particuliers de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, comprennent les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s et les plaintes. Le Tribunal a donc comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer tant sur le motif de la situation de famille que sur celui de la d\u00e9ficience, et pour faire droit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il serait appropri\u00e9 de le faire.\nVI. Le caract\u00e8re insuffisant des pr\u00e9cisions fournies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur le statut de famille\n[39] Dans sa requ\u00eate initiale, le plaignant a omis de fournir des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la requ\u00eate, le CFCP et la CFTC ont tous deux fait valoir que le motif n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 avec suffisamment de pr\u00e9cision pour leur permettre de se pr\u00e9parer en vue d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la requ\u00eate ne permettait pas de savoir en quoi consisterait la modification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Apr\u00e8s avoir moi\u2011m\u00eame examin\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 au plaignant de produire un addenda, ce qu\u2019il a fait, et dans cet addenda, il \u00e9nonce les all\u00e9gations sur lesquelles repose son all\u00e9gation de discrimination, y compris les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, le moment o\u00f9 lesdits \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits et les personnes concern\u00e9es.\n[40] Le CFCP, en particulier, a fait valoir que la requ\u00eate ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)c) des R\u00e8gles du TCDP :\n3(1) Les requ\u00eates, y compris les requ\u00eates d\u2019ajournement, sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par voie d\u2019avis de requ\u00eate. Ledit avis doit\n[\u2026]\nc) indiquer le redressement recherch\u00e9 et les motifs invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui;\n[41] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision A.F.P.C. c. Gouvernement des Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), 1999 CanLII 19858 (TCDP), il faut que chacune des parties donne des d\u00e9tails, et ce, afin de bien d\u00e9finir les questions en litige, de permettre aux parties de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, d\u2019\u00e9viter les surprises et de faciliter l\u2019audience.\n[42] La requ\u00eate initiale du plaignant ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)c) des R\u00e8gles, mais l\u2019addenda donne suffisamment de d\u00e9tails sur les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille propos\u00e9es pour que les intim\u00e9s puissent d\u00e9terminer la nature du redressement recherch\u00e9 et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nVII. La preuve prima facie\n[43] Le CFCP et la CFTC ont tous deux fait valoir que les all\u00e9gations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate et dans l\u2019addenda ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019un acte discriminatoire et n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Ces arguments seront examin\u00e9s conjointement, car ils concernent tous deux, pour l\u2019essentiel, la question de savoir si les all\u00e9gations de discrimination que le plaignant a formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019addenda n\u2019ont aucune chance de succ\u00e8s, et si elles devraient, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[44] Le CFCP souligne \u00e0 juste titre que le plaignant affirme dans l\u2019addenda que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] ils ne m\u2019ont pas fait travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Calgary, mais ils ont certainement tent\u00e9 de dissimuler d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment les enjeux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la situation de famille de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que je doive travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Calgary \u00bb. L\u2019addenda ne contient pas d\u2019all\u00e9gations concernant l\u2019omission de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation relativement \u00e0 la situation de famille, et le plaignant reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il a finalement obtenu des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 Lethbridge, d\u2019o\u00f9 ses obligations familiales \u00e9taient cens\u00e9es \u00e9maner. L\u2019addenda contient plut\u00f4t l\u2019all\u00e9gation plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les intim\u00e9s, ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ceux\u2011ci, ont refus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9voquer la question de la situation de famille du plaignant dans le processus visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des mesures d\u2019adaptation relativement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[45] Le CFCP soutient que le plaignant doit fournir une preuve prima facie de discrimination avant que l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive n\u2019entre en jeu. Cet argument est manifestement juste, mais il reste \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant doit s\u2019acquitter de ce fardeau dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, sur le seul fondement de l\u2019addenda, ou s\u2019il devrait \u00eatre tenu de le faire dans le cadre d\u2019une instruction compl\u00e8te de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[46] Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu ou non d\u2019autoriser une modification, \u00ab [\u2026] le Tribunal n\u2019examine pas en d\u00e9tail le fond de la modification propos\u00e9e \u00bb (Tabor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 4). Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il serait inusit\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal de rejeter une plainte, avant l\u2019audition de la preuve, au motif que les all\u00e9gations n\u2019\u00e9tablissaient pas une preuve prima facie. Les d\u00e9cisions concernant le pouvoir du Tribunal de radier certaines parties d\u2019une plainte pour ce motif sont instructives.\n[47] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (C.D.P.) c. Canada (P.G.), 2012 CF 445 (SSEFPN), conf. par 2013 CAF 75, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la question du rejet \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rejeter la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction au fond compl\u00e8te. Toutefois, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a clairement indiqu\u00e9 que ce pouvoir devait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence :\n[140] Je comprends cependant que le gouvernement soit d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation, formul\u00e9e dans Buffet, selon laquelle la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 39. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9claration.\n[48] Lorsqu\u2019il exerce ce pouvoir, le Tribunal doit s\u2019assurer que les parties ont eu la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations au sujet des questions en litige (voir Emmett c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2013 TCDP 12). Dans la d\u00e9cision Emmett, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[14] Je conviens que le Tribunal peut rejeter la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie d\u2019une plainte avant d\u2019avoir tenu une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond. Cependant, il est important de se souvenir que dans les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans SSEFPN et al. et Murray, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et le Tribunal ont clairement exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis selon lequel le processus de rejet d\u2019all\u00e9gations doit \u00eatre juste, qu\u2019il doit respecter les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle et que les parties doivent avoir la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter les preuves n\u00e9cessaires pour que soient tranch\u00e9es les questions soulev\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate.\n[49] Je doute que la pr\u00e9sente affaire constitue l\u2019un des cas les plus clairs o\u00f9 le Tribunal exercerait son pouvoir de rejeter la plainte de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9liminaire, d\u2019autant plus que le plaignant n\u2019est plus repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat et n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune aide juridique pour r\u00e9diger ses observations au sujet de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Le fait de priver le plaignant de l\u2019occasion de faire valoir l\u2019aspect relatif \u00e0 la situation de famille de ses plaintes, sur le seul fondement de ces observations, pr\u00e9par\u00e9es sans l\u2019aide d\u2019un avocat, serait loin de respecter la norme des cas les plus clairs.\n[50] Il serait en outre contraire aux principes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN d\u2019exiger que le plaignant, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, satisfasse \u00e0 la norme de preuve qui l\u2019oblige \u00e0 fournir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, et ce, sur le seul fondement des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019addenda. Une telle exigence ne lui donnerait pas la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u00e9cessaires pour que la question puisse \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e sans la tenue d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te.\nVIII. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[51] Le CFCP a fait valoir que la requ\u00eate du plaignant devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle constitue un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Cet argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 avant la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019addenda. Deux des motifs que le CFCP a fournis \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure se rapportent au manque de pr\u00e9cision des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille du plaignant. J\u2019estime que ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solues par la production de l\u2019addenda.\n[52] Le CFCP invoque essentiellement un autre motif \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une conclusion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Le CFCP soutient que l\u2019addenda a soulev\u00e9 un tout nouveau motif de distinction au beau milieu de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019audience, ce qui constitue, en soi, un abus de proc\u00e9dure, ou que, vu le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au CFCP en raison de cette modification tardive, cela constituerait, de fa\u00e7on similaire, un abus de proc\u00e9dure. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ces deux arguments relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure se recoupent, ils seront examin\u00e9s conjointement ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\n[53] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, le CFCP cite la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2002 CanLII 61852 (TCDP), conf. par 2004 CF 81, o\u00f9 le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par remise en litige. Toutefois, le CFCP mentionne \u00e9galement de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dans ses arguments, le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il subirait si la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait accueillie. De plus, il met l\u2019accent sur le caract\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019autoriser cette modification tardive de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019audience, ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re comme constituant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[54] Les tribunaux se sont prononc\u00e9s sur leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral inh\u00e9rent et r\u00e9siduel d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Cette notion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure vise les proc\u00e9dures qui sont \u00ab injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb (R. c. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (CSC), [1994] 1 R.C.S. 601, \u00e0 la page 616), ou les proc\u00e9dures qui constituent un \u00ab traitement oppressif \u00bb (R. c. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (CSC), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1659, \u00e0 la page 1667).\n[55] La juge McLachlin (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) a formul\u00e9 ainsi les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Scott, 1990 CanLII 27 (CSC), [1990] 3 R.C.S. 979, \u00e0 la page 1007 :\n[\u2026] l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure peut avoir lieu si : (1) les proc\u00e9dures sont oppressives ou vexatoires; et (2) elles violent les principes fondamentaux de justice sous\u2011jacents au sens de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re condition, \u00e0 savoir que les poursuites sont oppressives ou vexatoires, se rapporte au droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Cependant, la notion fait aussi appel \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime de proc\u00e8s justes et \u00e9quitables et \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice.\n[56] Voir \u00e9galement sur ce point la d\u00e9cision Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63, au paragraphe 51, o\u00f9 la Cour a soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]a doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure s\u2019articule autour de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus juridictionnel et non autour des motivations ou de la qualit\u00e9 des parties \u00bb.\n[57] Dans la d\u00e9cision Thwaites et al., 2007 TCDP 54, le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges :\n[9] La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est appliqu\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture aurait n\u00e9anmoins port\u00e9 atteinte aux principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice : Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 (CanLII), [2003] 3 R.C.S. 77, au paragraphe 37. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019application de cette doctrine dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal : Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Cremasco), 2004 FC 81 (CanLII), 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 41; conf. par 2004 CAF 363 (CanLII)\n[11] Cependant, le Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence dans l\u2019application de doctrines comme l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, lesquelles ont comme r\u00e9sultat le rejet d\u2019une plainte sans audience. Une telle d\u00e9cision prive les parties de l\u2019occasion de produire une preuve et de formuler des observations au sujet de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e violation de leurs droits (O\u2019Connor c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 5 (CanLII), au paragraphe 22). Quand il appara\u00eet clairement que le rejet d\u2019une plainte pourrait \u00eatre source d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 ou d\u2019injustice, la doctrine ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e (Morton, au paragraphe 24; Toronto c. S.C.F.P., au paragraphe 52).\n[58] Mes conclusions comportent trois volets. Premi\u00e8rement, si elle \u00e9tait accueillie, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, quoique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e tardivement dans la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal, n\u2019entra\u00eenerait pas la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une nouvelle question qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la CCDP ou au Tribunal. La voie administrative suivie par les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes devant la CCDP n\u2019est certes pas de la plus grande clart\u00e9, mais j\u2019estime que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comprennent le motif relatif \u00e0 la situation de famille. Ce motif de distinction illicite faisait partie des plaintes dont la CCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par la CCDP et a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un renvoi au Tribunal. Il n\u2019a pas simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 le premier jour de l\u2019audience. Les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements, \u00e0 savoir le processus visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des mesures d\u2019adaptation dans lequel le plaignant et les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient engag\u00e9s, et se rapportent \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s similaire. Les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille ne soul\u00e8vent pas une question tout \u00e0 fait nouvelle n\u2019ayant aucun rapport avec les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9j\u00e0 clairement expos\u00e9s dans les plaintes et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[59] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la requ\u00eate, si elle \u00e9tait accueillie, n\u2019entra\u00eenerait pas la remise en litige de questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue devant le Tribunal, ou ailleurs. Si la pr\u00e9sente affaire en est actuellement \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, aucune preuve n\u2019a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements relat\u00e9s dans l\u2019addenda. Sous le r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la LCDP, toutes les affaires sont examin\u00e9es par la CCDP avant leur renvoi au Tribunal pour instruction. Le renvoi est souvent pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019une enqu\u00eate, bien que cela ne soit pas obligatoire (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et l\u2019article 49). Les enqu\u00eateurs de la CCDP tirent effectivement des conclusions, mais comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la CCDP elle\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 ces conclusions lorsqu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, exercice qui peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la part de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties, et demand\u00e9 une instruction compl\u00e8te de l\u2019affaire. Le fait de saisir ensuite le Tribunal des questions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles la CCDP a demand\u00e9 une instruction ne saurait constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de l\u2019application normale du devoir que la loi impose au Tribunal d\u2019examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la CCDP, sans imposer de restrictions fond\u00e9es sur les conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP.\n[60] Troisi\u00e8mement, il ressort clairement de l\u2019historique proc\u00e9dural que les interactions entre les parties et la CCDP ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une certaine confusion au sujet de la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Si la CCDP n\u2019a pas, peut\u2011\u00eatre malheureusement, pris position ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il est clair que les parties, surtout le plaignant, n\u2019avaient pas bien compris la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte lorsque celle\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Le plaignant avait compris que les parties de ses plaintes se rapportant \u00e0 la situation de famille \u00e9taient en quelque sorte prescrites, et les intim\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 aux parties apr\u00e8s que les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s), avaient raisonnablement pu conclure que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille ne ferait pas partie de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, conclusion qu\u2019il aurait toutefois fallu r\u00e9examiner une fois les plaintes renvoy\u00e9es dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, sans exception ni r\u00e9serve.\n[61] Le plaignant \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9, et au moment o\u00f9 les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s contenant la situation de famille comme motif de distinction ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis parmi les documents communiqu\u00e9s par la CCDP. Toutefois, il s\u2019est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui\u2011m\u00eame tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure devant la CCDP et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, au moment o\u00f9 la CCDP lui a ordonn\u00e9 de ne pas modifier ses plaintes et de se fonder plut\u00f4t sur les formulaires de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9s. Il n\u2019a en outre plus d\u2019avocat pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[62] Vu les questions qui se sont pos\u00e9es avant le renvoi des plaintes, et compte tenu des principes plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice, le fait de modifier l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour qu\u2019il refl\u00e8te plus clairement la port\u00e9e r\u00e9elle des plaintes renvoy\u00e9es ne constituerait pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Le fait d\u2019autoriser la modification constitue plut\u00f4t l\u2019expression de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale face \u00e0 un plaignant non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat, compte tenu surtout des anomalies proc\u00e9durales survenues au cours de la proc\u00e9dure devant la CCDP.\nIX. Le fait d\u2019autoriser la modification serait ind\u00fbment pr\u00e9judiciable et entra\u00eenerait des inefficacit\u00e9s proc\u00e9durales\n[63] Le CFCP soutient que si la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait accueillie, il en r\u00e9sulterait des inefficacit\u00e9s proc\u00e9durales et un pr\u00e9judice indu. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument, le CFCP invoque l\u2019exigence \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal selon laquelle les affaires doivent \u00eatre instruites le plus efficacement et le plus rapidement possible.\n[64] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises, chaque fois \u00e0 la demande du plaignant. Les intim\u00e9s ont manifest\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises leur r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 demander un autre ajournement de l\u2019audience. Les intim\u00e9s se trouvent donc dans la situation difficile d\u2019avoir soit \u00e0 passer directement \u00e0 l\u2019audience en disposant de peu de temps pour r\u00e9agir aux all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille r\u00e9cemment formul\u00e9es, soit \u00e0 demander un ajournement retardant davantage la r\u00e9solution de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[65] Je suis consciente des probl\u00e8mes que peut cr\u00e9er la modification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tardive de l\u2019instance, mais dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une telle modification n\u2019entra\u00eene pas d\u2019inefficacit\u00e9s proc\u00e9durales ni de pr\u00e9judice indu. D\u2019abord, les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019addenda sont br\u00e8ves et d\u00e9coulent des m\u00eames \u00e9v\u00e9nements que ceux d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La p\u00e9riode est tr\u00e8s similaire et plusieurs des t\u00e9moins mentionn\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la situation de famille sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 cens\u00e9s t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ensuite, le plaignant n\u2019a demand\u00e9 aucune autre forme de redressement, de mesures r\u00e9paratrices ou d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, et n\u2019a pas ajout\u00e9 de noms \u00e0 sa liste de t\u00e9moins en vue de l\u2019audience. Enfin, les parties de l\u2019audience qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9es sont peu nombreuses, et il ne s\u2019agit que de l\u2019interrogatoire principal et du contre\u2011interrogatoire de l\u2019expert du plaignant. Ces interrogatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9s alors que l\u2019existence de cette question en suspens \u00e9tait connue. Compte tenu de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal est pr\u00eat \u00e0 examiner les demandes visant \u00e0 citer de nouveau le t\u00e9moin pour qu\u2019il d\u00e9pose sur la question de la situation de famille, si cela s\u2019av\u00e9rait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[66] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir le CFCP, ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des intim\u00e9s, ne serait pas indu, et qu\u2019il peut y \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 en communiquant d\u2019autres documents, en interrogeant de nouveau le seul t\u00e9moin d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu \u00e0 ce jour et en accordant un bref ajournement, si n\u00e9cessaire.\nX. Conclusion\n[67] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal accueille la requ\u00eate du plaignant visant \u00e0 modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour y ajouter uniquement les all\u00e9gations express\u00e9ment \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019addenda. Les intim\u00e9s, le CFCP et la CFTC, sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 apporter les modifications correspondantes \u00e0 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRicki T.

Ken Kelsh (le plaignant) all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime :\nde discrimination en cours d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience; de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019adaptation, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi);\nde repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi;\nde discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans les pratiques et proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019administration de tests et de postulation, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas que le plaignant est atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[4] L\u2019audience s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en deux p\u00e9riodes, soit du 11 janvier 2016 au 22 janvier 2016 et du 29 f\u00e9vrier 2016 au 3 mars 2016, date \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant a clos sa preuve.\n[5] Le 18 janvier 2016, au cours de son interrogatoire principal, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait form\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard une opinion en quelque sorte d\u00e9favorable. Son avocat lui a alors demand\u00e9 s\u2019il se souvenait avoir consult\u00e9 le Dr Marcus Feak, un psychologue, (question \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative), et lui a pos\u00e9 plusieurs autres questions au sujet des circonstances entourant le rapport du Dr Feak (la description du rapport du Dr Feak est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail plus loin). Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir le sentiment que l\u2019opinion de la direction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9gard \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le rapport du Dr Feak. Le plaignant a souscrit \u00e0 la proposition de son avocat, selon laquelle il n\u2019aurait jamais consult\u00e9 le Dr Feak s\u2019il avait su qu\u2019il avait le droit de passer l\u2019examen oral de la carte E. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve le rapport du Dr Feak.\n[6] Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire du plaignant men\u00e9 le 18 janvier 2016, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 la question du rapport du Dr Feak et lui a demand\u00e9 si le rapport renfermait des observations avec lesquelles il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative, indiquant la conclusion particuli\u00e8re qu\u2019il ne partageait pas. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a examin\u00e9 avec le plaignant une partie du rapport et a demand\u00e9 que le rapport soit admis en preuve. L\u2019avocat du plaignant s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9.\n[7] L\u2019avocat du plaignant invoquait divers motifs, dont l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour le Dr Feak de t\u00e9moigner sur le rapport et d\u2019\u00eatre contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet; le fait que le rapport contenait de nombreux renseignements qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal et dont le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas une id\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise; le fait que le Tribunal serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner un rapport complexe; le fait que le rapport renfermait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui portaient pr\u00e9judice au plaignant; le fait que le rapport ne tranchait pas les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de fonctionner; le fait que le rapport n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinent au regard des questions en litige, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne portait pas sur les aspects pratiques relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant et aux exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019attestation; et le fait que le rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et qu\u2019il entra\u00eenait un manquement au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e du plaignant.\n[8] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces objections, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que le rapport \u00e9tait pertinent quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e dans la plainte selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour tenir compte des besoins du plaignant; que le plaignant a parl\u00e9 de ce rapport lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal; que l\u2019intim\u00e9e subirait un pr\u00e9judice en droit si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 interroger le plaignant au sujet du rapport, lequel faisait partie de son processus relatif \u00e0 la prise de mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties, et apr\u00e8s avoir suspendu bri\u00e8vement la s\u00e9ance pour examiner ces observations, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019admettre en preuve le rapport du Dr Feak, mais j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019interroger et de contre\u2011interroger le Dr Feak, aurait un effet sur le poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 ce document.

Le Tribunal fixe ensuite un d\u00e9lai suffisant pour permettre \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de signifier et de d\u00e9poser un rapport d\u2019expert et pour permettre aux autres parties, si elles le souhaitent, de retenir les services de leur propre t\u00e9moin expert et de signifier et d\u00e9poser un rapport d\u2019expert en r\u00e9ponse, toujours \u00ab dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur \u00bb, comme il est pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles.

De plus, le rapport du Dr Feak a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis en preuve lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire du plaignant, dans les circonstances mentionn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[24] Bien que le plaignant se soit oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019admission en preuve du rapport du Dr Feak, il convient de souligner que les objections soulev\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9es sur la non\u2011conformit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e avec le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles. Ceci est probablement attribuable au fait qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, le report en question n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve ni admis en preuve \u00e0 titre de rapport d\u2019expert [italiques ajout\u00e9s].\n[25] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 et admis en preuve, le rapport du Dr Feak n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 ni produit en preuve \u00e0 titre de rapport d\u2019expert, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a avis\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal qu\u2019elle voulait assimiler le rapport du Dr Feak \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019expert, ou qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de citer le Dr Feak comme t\u00e9moin expert qu\u2019au moyen de son avis de requ\u00eate du 24 mars 2016 \u2013 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 moins de 6 semaines avant la reprise de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en mai, et 3 semaines apr\u00e8s que le plaignant eut clos sa preuve.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas non plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans le rapport les titres de comp\u00e9tence du Dr Feak, comme le pr\u00e9voit le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 6(3)a)(ii) des R\u00e8gles.\n[27] Compte tenu de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de relativement au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles et aux actes ou omissions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je conclus que cette derni\u00e8re ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e audit paragraphe.\n2) En cas de non\u2011conformit\u00e9 au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles, dans quelle mesure le plaignant a\u2011t\u2011il subi un pr\u00e9judice?\n[28] J\u2019estime que l\u2019argument du plaignant selon lequel le rapport du Dr Feak, en soi, lui porte pr\u00e9judice et qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de toute fa\u00e7on se rapporte au bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci. Il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade pour le Tribunal de se prononcer sur cet argument.\n[29] Je conclus que, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait avis\u00e9 le plaignant que le 24 mars 2016 qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de demander l\u2019autorisation d\u2019assimiler le rapport du Dr Feak \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019expert et de citer le Dr Feak comme t\u00e9moin expert, le plaignant n\u2019a pas eu une possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de retenir les services de son propre t\u00e9moin expert et d\u2019obtenir un rapport d\u2019expert en r\u00e9ponse, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(3)b)des R\u00e8gles.\n[30] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de citer d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins en contre\u2011preuve. Il est possible que le plaignant et son avocat d\u00e9cident en fait de ne pas le faire, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e a effectivement priv\u00e9 le plaignant de la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der de la sorte avant de clore sa preuve.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019avance au t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert livr\u00e9 par le Dr Feak, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son propre expert ou d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, le plaignant a subi un pr\u00e9judice.\n[32] Par contre, il existe plusieurs facteurs qui tendent \u00e0 diminuer le pr\u00e9judice subi par le plaignant.\n[33] Au paragraphe 22 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dat\u00e9 du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le plaignant affirme que Dennis Curtis lui a demand\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen psychologique en 2007, ce qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation effectu\u00e9e par le Dr Feak et au rapport \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[34] Au paragraphe 22 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant cite \u00e9galement deux passages du rapport du Dr Feak \u00e0 l\u2019appui des mesures de r\u00e9parations qu\u2019il sollicite \u2013 \u00e0 savoir la permission de passer l\u2019examen de la carte D oralement.\n[35] Le plaignant a divulgu\u00e9 le rapport du Dr Feak dans le cadre de sa propre communication de documents qui accompagnait son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (au par. 22). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le plaignant a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du rapport lors de son interrogatoire principal. Le rapport du Dr Feak fait donc partie de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits du dossier du plaignant.\n[36] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat du rapport du Dr Feak \u2013 aux paragraphes 61, 64, 79, 94, 95 et 96. J\u2019estime que ledit rapport fait aussi partie de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits du dossier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que le plaignant en \u00e9tait au courant depuis le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9.\n[37] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, on ne peut conclure que les capacit\u00e9s de lire et d\u2019\u00e9crire du plaignant et leur effet sur son aptitude de faire le travail qu\u2019il souhaite sont autant de points litigieux dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[38] Le rapport du Dr Feak traite de ces m\u00eames questions et le plaignant en \u00e9tait au courant depuis un certain temps.\n[39] Pour d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9judice subi par le plaignant, je prends aussi en compte les observations formul\u00e9es par celui\u2011ci dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, portant que le rapport remonte \u00e0 9 ans, qu\u2019il date d\u2019une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat et \u00e9prouvait un stress consid\u00e9rable en raison de sa vie personnelle. Ces facteurs peuvent avoir une incidence sur le poids qui sera finalement accord\u00e9 au rapport du Dr Feak.\n[40] En outre, il ne faut pas perdre de vue que le rapport a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire du plaignant. Lorsque j\u2019ai admis le rapport en preuve, j\u2019ai conclu \u00e0 sa pertinence pour la plainte aux fins pour lesquelles il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9.\n[41] Dans l\u2019ensemble, je suis d\u2019avis que le plaignant subit un pr\u00e9judice important du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e au paragraphe 6(3), et en raison du moment o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate, mais qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice subi r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 la suite du \u00ab recours \u00e0 des pi\u00e8ges \u00bb. On ne saurait affirmer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que le t\u00e9moignage potentiel d\u2019expert prend le plaignant compl\u00e8tement au d\u00e9pourvu, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait absolument aucun avis donn\u00e9 (implicitement ou explicitement) de ce t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert, et qu\u2019aucun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019avait dont \u00e9t\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, vers\u00e9 au dossier de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit.\n[42] Je note que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas le droit du plaignant d\u2019appeler des t\u00e9moins en contre\u2011preuve.\n[43] J\u2019examinerai maintenant la question de savoir dans quelle mesure le pr\u00e9judice est r\u00e9parable.\n3) Le pr\u00e9judice est\u2011il r\u00e9parable?\n[44] J\u2019ai conclu que le plaignant a subi un pr\u00e9judice. Le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de se voir donner la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter sa position doit \u00eatre concili\u00e9 avec le droit du plaignant, si le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert livr\u00e9 par le Dr Feak est admis en preuve, de se voir donner \u00e0 son tour la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter une contre\u2011preuve en r\u00e9ponse au t\u00e9moignage du Dr Feak, et de formuler des observations \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[45] Le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles conf\u00e8re au Tribunal une grande latitude pour concevoir une r\u00e9paration afin de supprimer le pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019autre partie si le membre instructeur accorde une autorisation \u00e0 la partie qui ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles. Le membre instructeur peut accorder une autorisation \u00ab \u00e0 des conditions conformes aux fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1) \u00bb.\n[46] Je conclus que, si le plaignant souhaite demander une telle autorisation, un ajournement qui donne lieu \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai utile et raisonnable permettrait \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de se trouver dans la position o\u00f9 il se serait autrement trouv\u00e9 si l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui avait donn\u00e9 l\u2019avis appropri\u00e9 concernant le Dr Feak. Le plaignant aurait ainsi la possibilit\u00e9 de citer son propre t\u00e9moin expert et d\u2019obtenir son propre rapport d\u2019expert, s\u2019il souhaite le faire, ou de citer d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins en contre\u2011preuve au sujet du rapport et du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Feak.\n[47] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ajourner l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode de l\u2019audience qui se d\u00e9roulera du 2 au 13 mai 2016 pour r\u00e9gler compl\u00e8tement cette question. Cela ne serait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties qui souhaitent que l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule aux dates fix\u00e9es.\n[48] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en mai, qui comprend les dates r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour citer ses propres t\u00e9moins. Au regard du 8e jour de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en mai, apr\u00e8s la comparution de tous ses t\u00e9moins, mais avant la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales, l\u2019intim\u00e9e propose une [traduction] \u00ab possible contre\u2011preuve \u00bb. Je tiens pour acquis que ce jour est indiqu\u00e9 comme date \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant pourra citer son t\u00e9moin expert en r\u00e9ponse ou appeler des t\u00e9moins en contre\u2011preuve relativement au rapport et au t\u00e9moignage du Dr Feak.\n[49] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est raisonnable de pr\u00e9sumer que le plaignant et son avocat consacreront leur temps \u00e0 l\u2019audience pendant les 7 premiers jours. Par cons\u00e9quent, le calendrier que l\u2019intim\u00e9e propose ne permet pas au plaignant de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un d\u00e9lai raisonnable pour pouvoir trouver un expert ou un autre t\u00e9moin en contre\u2011preuve, si son avocat et lui d\u00e9cident de le faire.\n[50] Si le Tribunal reconna\u00eet la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert du Dr Feak et que le plaignant souhaite pr\u00e9senter une preuve d\u2019expert ou autre et citer un t\u00e9moin expert ou d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins en r\u00e9ponse au rapport et au t\u00e9moignage du Dr Feak, il aura le droit \u00e0 un ajournement, apr\u00e8s la comparution de tous les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, proc\u00e9dure dont je fixerai les modalit\u00e9s apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties. En d\u2019autres termes, tous les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e feront l\u2019objet d\u2019un interrogatoire principal et d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire, ainsi que d\u2019un r\u00e9interrogatoire, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Le plaignant aura alors dispos\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9lai suffisant pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il demande l\u2019ajournement en question et les deux parties pourront pr\u00e9senter des observations sur les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019ajournement.\n[51] Il ressort des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent que je ne dispose pas enti\u00e8rement de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni des arguments des parties. En effet, il est extr\u00eamement difficile d\u2019examiner \u00e0 fond l\u2019ensemble des objections au sujet du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert propos\u00e9 avant que ledit t\u00e9moin ne soit r\u00e9ellement produit (voir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard SSEFPN c. PGC, 2012 TCDP 28). Selon l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles, le membre du Tribunal qui est saisi d\u2019une requ\u00eate peut donner des directives au sujet de la pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019argumentation et de la preuve, et pr\u00e9ciser notamment sous quelle forme, de quelle mani\u00e8re et \u00e0 quel moment elles doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et disposer de la requ\u00eate de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9e.\n[52] Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai abord\u00e9 la question du pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant de la non\u2011conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles et j\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que cela ne fait pas obstacle au redressement demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Toutefois, l\u2019affaire n\u2019est pas tranch\u00e9e pour autant. Les autres questions concernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert du Dr Feak, dont celles portant sur son rapport, seront examin\u00e9es lors de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en mai. Dans l\u2019ordonnance qui suit, je donne une directive sur l\u2019obligation de production de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi que sur la proc\u00e9dure que j\u2019ai l\u2019intention de suivre \u00e0 la reprise de l\u2019audience. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 toutes les questions que je serai en mesure de d\u00e9cider ultimement s\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles et permettre au Dr Feak de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert.\nV. Ordonnance\n[53] L\u2019intim\u00e9e doit, au plus tard le 29 avril 2016, faire parvenir aux parties, et d\u00e9poser devant le Tribunal, une d\u00e9claration des titres de comp\u00e9tence du Dr Feak, conform\u00e9ment au sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 6(3)a)(ii) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04).\n[54] Lors de l\u2019audience qui doit d\u00e9buter le 2 mai 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut citer le Dr Marcus Feak \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert et le plaignant peut contre\u2011interroger celui\u2011ci et formuler des observations sur (i) la question de savoir s\u2019il convient de reconna\u00eetre la qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert du Dr Feak et sur (ii) l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il compte livrer.\n[55] Le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera alors s\u2019il reconna\u00eet la qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert du Dr Feak.\n[56] Si le Tribunal d\u00e9cide de reconna\u00eetre la qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert du Dr Feak, il faut proc\u00e9der comme suit : apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de tous les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et avant la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales, le plaignant doit avoir l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter une contre\u2011preuve au sujet du rapport et du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Feak. Le plaignant peut demander un ajournement \u00e0 cette fin, dont les modalit\u00e9s seront \u00e9tablies par le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu toutes les parties. Peu importe si le plaignant demande un ajournement, la contre\u2011preuve que le plaignant peut choisir de pr\u00e9senter sera assujettie aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles.\nSign\u00e9e par\nOlga Luftig\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 25 avril 2016",
